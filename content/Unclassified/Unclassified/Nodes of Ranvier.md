## Explanation of Nodes of Ranvier

Nodes of Ranvier are small, unmyelinated gaps along the axons of neurons in the nervous system where the myelin sheath, an insulating layer formed by glial cells, is absent. These nodes play a critical role in saltatory conduction, the process by which nerve impulses (action potentials) propagate rapidly along myelinated axons by "jumping" from one node to the next, significantly increasing conduction speed compared to unmyelinated axons.

## Structure and Function

- Location: Small gaps (1–3 µm) between myelin segments (internodes).
    
- CNS: Oligodendrocytes form thinner myelin, shorter nodes (1–2 µm), slower conduction (2–80 m/s), limited repair.
    
- PNS: Schwann cells form thicker myelin, longer nodes (up to 3 µm), faster conduction (up to 120 m/s), robust repair.
    
- Features: High density of voltage-gated sodium channels (Naᵥ1.6) and mitochondria; paranodal/juxtaparanodal regions stabilize signaling.
    
- Role: Facilitate action potential “jumping,” reducing energy use. Mitochondria provide ATP and buffer calcium.
    
- Clinical Relevance: Demyelination (e.g., MS in CNS, GBS in PNS, ALS) disrupts nodes, causing conduction failure and mitochondrial stress.
    

## [[Jack Kruse, MD|Jack Kruse]]’s Perspectives

Kruse views nodes as biological semiconductor junctions, integrating quantum biology, as per the blog’s framework:

- Proton Conduction: Nodes conduct protons via the Grotthuss mechanism through [[Exclusion Zone Water|exclusion zone]] (EZ) water, forming a “Z-Z highway.” Deuterium accumulation (from nnEMF, processed foods) slows conduction, impairing function in disorders like MS, ALS.
    
- UPE Emissions: Nodes emit ultraweak photon emissions (UPEs, 200–350 nm) due to mitochondrial ROS or Cherenkov radiation, amplified in demyelination, disrupting neural synchrony (e.g., bipolar disorder).
    
- P-N Junction Analogy: Nodes control proton/ion flow like semiconductor diodes, supported by mitochondrial electric fields (30 MV/m).
    
- Environmental Sensitivity: Sunlight optimizes nodal function via circadian rhythms; nnEMF disrupts proton dynamics, exacerbating ALS through intense heteroplasmy.
    
- Lithium’s Role: Absorbs UPEs, stabilizes proton hopping and CSF pH, reducing “photonic noise” in demyelinated nodes, aiding bipolar disorder.
