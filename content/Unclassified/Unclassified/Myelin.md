Myelin, classically understood as the fatty insulation that speeds up nerve conduction, is viewed by [[Jack Kruse, MD|Dr. Jack Kruse]] as a **quantum insulator and dielectric material** that plays a **foundational role in bioelectrical signaling, redox balance, and light-based communication** within the nervous system. He emphasizes **its role in preserving coherence and energy efficiency**, beyond the traditional speed-of-conduction model.

### **Summary of Dr. Jack Kruse’s Theory of Myelin**

Dr. Jack Kruse argues that myelin is not merely a passive insulator for nerve impulses but a **key player in the quantum architecture of the nervous system**. He views it as a **dielectric substance** that insulates and modulates **DC electric currents**, preserves **quantum coherence**, and regulates **photon and electron flow** in neurons. Myelin, in his view, helps maintain **low-entropy information transfer** and minimizes **loss of bioelectrical and photonic energy**. It works in tandem with water, collagen, and melanin to sustain the body's internal electromagnetic and photonic communication networks.

Kruse believes the **loss or degradation of myelin**, as seen in diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS), reflects a breakdown in **redox balance and circadian coherence**, not just an autoimmune issue. He links this to factors like **chronic nnEMF exposure**, **blue light toxicity**, **poor mitochondrial function**, and **disrupted DHA recycling**, which compromise the biophysical properties that myelin supports. DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), a key fatty acid in myelin, is particularly emphasized by Kruse as critical for **electron tunneling** and **photonic signaling** across neural membranes.

### **Comparison: Kruse vs. Mainstream View**

|**Aspect**|**Kruse’s View**|**Mainstream View**|
|---|---|---|
|**Primary Role**|Dielectric insulator facilitating quantum coherence, redox flow, and biophotonic signaling|Fatty sheath that insulates axons to increase action potential speed|
|**Mechanism**|Modulates DC currents, supports light/electron flow, maintains low-entropy signaling|Saltatory conduction via [[Nodes of Ranvier]] for faster impulse travel|
|**Key Components**|DHA, water, collagen, melanin, myelin—all part of a quantum biophysical system|Lipid bilayer with proteins and cholesterol-rich composition|
|**Health Implications**|Degradation linked to circadian dysfunction, mitochondrial stress, and EMF damage|Degradation seen as autoimmune (e.g., MS), genetic, or inflammatory|
|**Energy Transfer**|Preserves electron and photon flow in the brain to support quantum processing|Enables rapid transmission of electrochemical signals|
|**Scientific Status**|Non-mainstream, supported by emerging quantum biology theories but lacking clinical validation|Broadly accepted based on cellular biology and neurophysiology|

### **In Summary**

Kruse’s view expands myelin from a structural and conductive tool into a **quantum-level regulator of coherent information and energy**. While the mainstream model is centered on **signal speed and protection**, Kruse sees myelin as part of a broader **light- and electron-based communication system**, crucial to maintaining **optimal brain function and systemic coherence** in relation to environmental light and EMF exposure.
