## Polio Vaccine and SV40 Contamination

[[Dr. Jack Kruse|Kruse]] discusses the polio vaccine, particularly the Salk inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) introduced in the 1950s, as a pivotal moment in medical history that he believes was marred by significant oversights and deliberate cover-ups. Key points from his perspective include:

- Development and SV40 Contamination: [[Jack Kruse, MD|Kruse]] asserts that the polio vaccine, developed by Jonas Salk and grown on African green monkey kidney cells, was contaminated with Simian Virus 40 (SV40), a virus later found to have oncogenic (cancer-causing) properties. He claims that between 1955 and 1963, approximately 63 million Americans and millions more worldwide were exposed to SV40 through the polio vaccine. Kruse cites studies, such as those from the National Cancer Institute, showing SV40’s presence in tumors like mesothelioma, brain cancers, and lymphomas, suggesting it triggered a surge in soft-tissue cancers. He argues this was a major public health failure, as the contamination was discovered by researchers like Bernice Eddy in the early 1960s, yet the National Institutes of Health (NIH) allowed contaminated vaccines to be administered for years before reforms were implemented.
- Cover-Up by Authorities: Kruse contends that health authorities, including the NIH and pharmaceutical companies, downplayed the SV40 issue to maintain public confidence in vaccination programs. He suggests this was not merely negligence but part of a broader pattern of suppressing inconvenient truths about medical interventions to protect institutional interests. He frames the SV40 contamination as a precursor to modern vaccine controversies, including those surrounding COVID-19.
- Health Implications: Kruse links SV40 exposure to a “cancer epidemic,” citing National Cancer Institute data showing a 50% increase in skin, lymphoma, prostate, and breast cancers between 1973 and 1988. He argues that SV40’s integration into human DNA altered cellular biology, contributing to chronic diseases. This aligns with his broader health theories, where environmental factors like electromagnetic fields (EMF) and vaccines disrupt biological systems.
