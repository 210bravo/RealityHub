[[Jack Kruse, MD|Dr. Jack Kruse]] references the Cutter Incident of 1955 as a critical event that exposed flaws in vaccine production and regulatory oversight, framing it as a precursor to later medical scandals. Key points include:

- Overview of the Incident: In April 1955, Cutter Laboratories, one of five companies producing Salk’s polio vaccine, distributed approximately 165,000 doses containing live polio virus due to defective inactivation processes. This led to 40,000 cases of polio, 200 children with varying degrees of paralysis, and 10 deaths, including the grandson of Dr. [[Alton Ochsner]]. [[Jack Kruse, MD|Kruse]] emphasizes the tragedy’s scale, noting cases like Susan Pierce, who died days after receiving the vaccine, and Ochsner’s grandson Eugene Davis, who also died.
- Kruse’s Interpretation: Kruse argues the Cutter Incident was not just a manufacturing error but a symptom of systemic failures in government oversight and pharmaceutical greed. He claims the federal government, through its vaccine regulatory agency, was primarily responsible for failing to enforce rigorous safety standards, exonerating Salk but implicating institutions like the NIH. Kruse suggests the incident was downplayed to preserve public trust in vaccines, similar to the SV40 cover-up. He sees it as evidence of a pattern where public health is sacrificed for institutional and corporate interests.
- Connection to Larger Narrative: Kruse frames the Cutter Incident as a foundational event that eroded trust in medical authorities and set the stage for later controversies, including SV40 and COVID-19 vaccines. He argues it demonstrated how pharmaceutical companies and government agencies prioritize profit and control over safety, a theme he extends to modern medical interventions.
