# Covid Vaccine

- was not ready for distribution and that was known in advance
- Was contaminated with DNA
- DNA safety levels are based on non mRNA tech
- SV40 is oncogenic 
- Besides the DNA contamination, the mRNA platform and Covid vaccine have other majour health concerns such as Abnormal shifts in IgG4 levels, interference with the P53 tumor suppressor gene, decrease in DNA repair functions, toxic LNPs, and overall suppression of immune response
- Ivermectin was an effective treatment for Covid and ==will likely treat many cancers== 
- Vaccines in general are not thoroughly tested i.e. they do not go through long term, randomized double blind saline placebo control trials. They don’t even go through mid term control trials and rarely through short term randomized placebo controlled trials. They also do not go through trials to assess the effects of multiple vaccinations

# Food

- Pyramid was upside down
- LDL and the cholesterol hypothesis is incomplete at best. Most likely it is ==marginally relevant for the standard American diet, but otherwise it is nearly irrelevant or ever opposite to the truth==
- Seed oils are bad

- Emf 

- Exposure is ==majour health concern==
- Low frequencies close to natural rhythms may be more disruptive
- Transmission lines are oncogenic
- Research has been stifled by the DOD and big tech

# Climate Change Agenda

- Geo-engineering such as dimming the sun is a terrible idea. It will lead to heath issues, air quality issues, crop issues, solar issues and likely all just to control populations not for climate
- Well raised cattle are net negative co2

# Health Topics

- ==Fluoride is bad==
- [[Cold thermogenesis]] is worth it
- Basically everything should be considered from a circadian and and biophysics (light) perspective 

# Canadian Politics

- Non permanent resident rates coming into Canada are unprecedented and ==intentional to destabilize the country== 
- The trucker convoy was a safe and necessary protest that was unlawfully and unethically shut down
- ==Controlling truckers finances is but a minor window into future plans of control==

- History and elite preppers

- The Vatican has at least 80kms of underground private tunnels 
- There are majour tunnel systems under most majour cities 
- ==No suspicious bodies have been proven to exist from residential schools yet==

  

Inconclusive but leaning my way:

- The big idea of the overarching goal is the most difficult to determine. I suspect they have learned that forced and harsh enslavement similar to old school slavery, extreme communism, or serfdom all eventually lead to revolution. The new form of control will be sold to us as a utopia. Each time we give up freedoms it will be for convenience, or safety or efficiency. Until eventually the walls have closed in and you are modern day slaves with the freedom to enjoy your minor enjoyments briefly before bed. 
- [[Dr. Jack Kruse|Jack Kruse]]

- Everything should be decentralize like nature
- Health care is too focused on biochemistry and needs to integrate biophysics
- Light, EMF regulation and vaccine avoidance are the biggest factors for health. 
- [[Bitcoin]] is the only decentralized currency 
- Fabians are the ones most trying to control the world
- One should maximum sun exposure short of burning
- Between Covid vax, contaminated food and air we are being intentionally turned into RFID or Bluetooth enabled biological devices
- Sunglasses are bad except in extreme situations (long times on ocean or snow)

- Climate/Green agenda

- The green agenda is not actually addressing climate change. It is either a financial tool of capitalism, social control or both. 
- There is a depopulation agenda in the works that will speed up as the population becomes less necessary (ie once AI and automation are sufficiently effective)
- [[World Economic Forum|WEF]] is a tool for globalists and global control
- WHO is a tool for globalists and global control
- UN Sustainable Development Goals being tools to empower global capitalists to monetize the few remaining goods outsize of our economic system
- Most green energy production other than solar is a net negative unless there is other benefits such as off grid rural or self sufficiency 
- Large scale chemtrails application is occurring
- Haarp is likely being used to modify weather and climate
- There are multiple RAAD systems also doing suspicious weather modification
- 15 minute cities are just  for control and limiting mobility 
- Sea levels don’t seem to be rising and elite are buying waterfront… sea level rise does not seem like a risk
- Ai will be integrated into the surveillance state for individual manipulation of personal credit scores that track your behavior and allow you more or less freedom
- Electric vehicles are largely being implementing as tools to control travel and will be integrated into the social credit system
- Replacement theory is correct
- There is an intentional push to emasculate men via hormone disruption (pesticides, blue light, marketing, media, diet)
- There is an intentional push to reduce meat consumption under the narrative of climate change but really to weaken the population
- Renewable power is generally a net negative other than in rural off grid applications 
- Nuclear power is the best source of power for the masses but is being suppressed because the elite want power to be scarce

- History

- The Smithsonian is controlling access to our history so that we cannot learn where we came from and our true history 
- The Smithsonian ran contests to produce fake giants around the same time that people were supposedly finding giants around the USAin order to be able to deny the real giants were found in the future
- There was likely an advanced civilization in North America in the past. Possibly Tartaria otherwise maybe just a high advance native population
- Mainstream archeology is trying to discredit alternative histories such as the younger dryas impact theory and advanced past civilizations without debating their merit
- The world is quickly moving to CBDCs and stable coins mainly as tools of population control

- Health

- Sunscreen being oncogenic
- Iodine is good to counter the high levels of Halides in our modern world  

- Fabians

- Fabians are the old world Jewish bankers and elite and the British royalty and their cronies. This may now include the technocrats, media moguls and modern elite (largely but not exclusively Jewish).
- When it comes to Jewish noticing, it is important to recognize that the issue not all Jews, it just tends to usually be Jews. 
- Also, the upper Jewish elite appear to be satanic and just use Judaism as a cover
- DOGE is doing good auditing of gov programs to weaken their opposition but also to ultimately get access to government data on the population to integrate with x.ai and [[PALANTIR]] 
- Hollywood, the banks, the media, and the music industry are all largely controlled by Jewish people and or Fabian’s. This clique has killed and silenced many people who have spoken out such as Michael Jackson, Kanye, Prince,  Bieber, and many many others 
- Fabian Maximus

- delay and attrition 
- British 1884 London
- Slow roll communism
- One world government
- Their logo is a wolf in sheep’s clothing
- Developed the [[Balfour Declaration]]
- WEF

- WW2

- [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] was not a saint, but he was reacting appropriately to the situation he was presented with. 
- The stories about death camps are all nearly 100% false. The camps were labour camps or transition camps as they moved populations of Jews and non Germans to Eastern Europe, Palestine or elsewhere. 
- The majority of death was either from typhoid or eventually once the allies were winning at the very end and bombing the supply lines prisoners began to starve because the Germans struggle to maintain supply lines and properly look after the prisoners 
- The treaty of Versailles was so harsh that an extreme leader was necessary to pick Germany back up
- The jewish bankers took advantage of the German people when they were most desperate post treaty. 
- In order for Germany to recover from the treaty Hitler took back control of the currency from the bankers. Jews demanded and created international sanctions on Germany to pressure Hitler to give back control to the bankers. In retaliation the German people boycotted Jewish shops. This lead to the Jewish people declaring war on Germany. Things slowly got worse until Germany had to lock up an entire people into labour camps once the war broke loose and many Jewish Germans fought for the allies from within. I don’t condone labour camps of entire peoples. But this was the norm for these days (Japanese interment camps in Canada and the USA, Chinese camps by the Japanese and many many more). 
- Hitler tried to meet with Britain to negotiate peace 6 times.
- Hitler only went into Poland to protect the German people of Danzig which was part of Germany until the treaty of Versailles
- Britain purposely bombed civilians and Hitler refused to bomb civilians. Eventually he had to retaliate after telling Churchill to stop bombing civilians of Berlin 6 times. Churchill did this to make Hitler retaliate and pressure the USA into the war
- The entire war began as a bankers war (as most wars do) and it ended with the Jewish bankers winning and writing the history to suit their narrative 
- The Bolshevik revolution in Russia was largely an overthrown of the Russian monarchy by a foreign Jewish group. The Bolshevik leaders were mostly Jews and regularly targeted Christian Russians. 
- Hitler’s motivations for locking up the Jews was largely because he was fighting Jewish communism on the east and a Jewish bank backed system on the west while dealing with Jewish citizens there were undermining the German defence from within

- Central bank/federal reserve

- [[Andrew Jackson]] was nearly assassinated because he opposed the second Bank of America (Fabian Jews)
- Titanic sank on purpose to facilitate the creation of the 3rd bank by killing the opposition
- Hitler, Gaddafi, JFK, Lincoln, [[Andrew Jackson]] were all killed or attempted assassination partially due to their taking back control of their currencies from the bankers. 
- Hitler and Gaddafi were also demonized for this whereas the American presidents were killed but not demonized. 

- Finance

- The world is quickly moving to CBDCs and stable coins mainly as tools of population control
- The Canadian pension plan and American equivalent have been spent by the deep state. The money is not there. Because the gov gets the money if you die, either people need to die or the retirement age needs to be pushed back in order to hide that the money is missing
- $21 trillion of us retirement funds are missing. Likely that it has gone towards building underground cities

- Other:

- Large scale child trafficking is a reality
- Child trafficking is majour amongst the elite for Pedophilia and adrenochrome 

- 9-11 was a cia/mossad/Fabian project to implement the patriot act to control population of the UsA, justify invading Iraq, and Afghanistan and the war on terroism that eventually expanded to Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Libya and eventually Iran. 
- These invasions are to benefit greater Israel, the military industrial complex, blackrock and probably the Smithsonian. 

- Chronology

- It seems likely that out timeline is incorrect in many ways. It seems likely that Anatoly Fomenko, and/or Gunner Heinrichson are correct that 700-1000 year or even more have been added to our timeline between the time of Jesus and now
- If the bible is true, it seems likely that we are in a different period in the bible story than taught in church. It seems more likely that we are in Satan’s little season post Christ’s millennial reign. 
- That would mean that true Jerusalem coming down from the heavens is next on the timeline 
- Project blue beam or just alien narratives could be used to cover up the true reality of Jeruselum
- It seems possible that historical Jeruselum changed locations multiple times. Beginning just north of Istanbul, shifting to Istanbul then eventually Moscow and now Palestine

  

Still fully inconclusive but I largely believe:

- Climate change is not significantly man made in the traditional sense. If it is man made it is mostly geoengineering and HAARP on purpose
- There are large old world underground cities under the USA and Eastern Europe. 
- Many middle eastern wars were partially motivated to control the narrative of history 
- There are majour underground cities under the Denver airport, under raven rock, under Washington DC, under Camp David, connected to the Grand Canyon
- Moon landing never occurred 
- Oil is not fossil based. It is abiogenic, renewable and plentiful
- Malaysia flight was warped away by plasma orbs for real
- The governments have zero point energy
- Either aliens are here or governments have highly advanced tech 
- Nicotine benefits to counter negative effects of Covid vaccine
- Old world cathedrals may have been used to harness ether or electricity from the air
- Old world cathedrals rose windows are based on schimatics  
- Old world fires are used to confuse the narrative of old world buildings
- The world fairs were used to also confuse the historical narrative and justify demolishing some old buildings
- The residential schools may have been to force the natives to forget this old world history
- If time has been added to extend the mainstream timeline that could mean that either our history is completely wrong, or it could mean that the world is much younger
- It is possible to maybe blend the younger dryas’s narrative with the biblical narrative of the flood and destroying the giants and advanced civilizations of Anonnacke. 
- Maybe dragons are real and they have been relabeled dinosaurs and humans and dragons did briefly live together. If true I would suspect most died out and a few still existed, and humans killed the last few dragons similar to all the knight fairy tales
- Whether we are revolving around the sun vs the earth being stationary is surprisingly poorly proven. The Marcus and Morley experiment did not actually prove the lack of ether, it is possible that we are just not moving. 
- The red shift of deep space and the axis of evil both suggest we could be stationary 

  

Inconclusive by leaning away from me:

  

I was wrong:
