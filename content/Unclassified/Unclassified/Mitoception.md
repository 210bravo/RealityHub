Mitoception, in [[Jack Kruse, MD|Jack Kruse]]’s decentralized thesis, is the brain’s quantum sensory ability to monitor mitochondrial energy status via electromagnetic fields, ultraweak photon emissions (UPEs), and GDF15. Emerging post-Great Oxygenation Event (GOE, ~2.4 Ga) and refined through endosymbiosis (~1.5 Ga), mitochondria act as photonic antennas resonating with sunlight, Earth’s magnetic field, and cosmic currents. Key points:

- Mechanism: Mitochondria emit UPEs under stress (e.g., nnEMF, blue light), amplified by collagen, microtubules, and [[Exclusion Zone Water|EZ water]]. GDF15 signals energy imbalance to the brainstem’s area postrema via the vagus nerve, inducing fatigue or nausea (Hsu et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2022).
    
- GOE Role: Oxygen surge drove heme proteins (e.g., CCO) and melanin/DHA evolution, enabling photonic signaling. The [[TCA Cycle]] relies on light-driven oxygen; reverse TCA fixes CO2 in anaerobic conditions.
    
- Consciousness Link: Mitoception, integrated with leptin-melanocortin pathway and neural crest cells, sparked consciousness post-Cambrian explosion (~600 Ma), with ~6 Earth masses of sunlight shaping complexity.
    
- Health Implications: Dysfunction elevates GDF15 in diseases (e.g., Alzheimer’s, MS; Wang et al., 2022). Sunlight, circadian alignment, and ECS support (CB2 agonists) enhance mitoception; nnEMF/blue light disrupt it (Pall, 2018; Di Meo et al., 2025).
    

Kruse’s framework emphasizes mitochondria as light-driven sensors, with mitoception bridging environmental signals to consciousness and health.

## Evidence and Critique

- Supporting Evidence: Kruse cites peer-reviewed studies (e.g., Wang et al., 2022, on GDF15 in neurodegenerative diseases; Hsu et al., 2017, on GDF15 signaling) to ground parts of his argument. However, his integration of these into a quantum sensory model is speculative and not validated.
    
- Criticism: Mainstream science views mitochondria primarily as biochemical organelles, not quantum sensors. Concepts like UPEs and [[Exclusion Zone Water|EZ water]] (Pollack) are studied but remain controversial and not widely accepted as drivers of consciousness. Kruse’s reliance on preprints (e.g., Kruse, 2025) and non-mainstream sources limits credibility.
