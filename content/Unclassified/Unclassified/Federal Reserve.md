## Early Banking: The [[First Bank of the United States]] (1781)

The United States’ first attempt at a national bank was the [[First Bank of the United States]], chartered by the Continental Congress on May 26, 1781, and opened in Philadelphia on January 7, 1782. Proposed by Robert Morris, the Superintendent of Finance, it was modeled after the Bank of England to address the financial chaos of the Revolutionary War. The bank was intended to stabilize the economy by issuing currency, lending to the government, and managing war debts. It was privately subscribed but operated with congressional approval, holding a charter to function as a national bank. However, it faced significant opposition due to concerns about foreign influence (some investors were foreign) and favoritism toward wealthy elites. Critics argued it undermined state-chartered banks by accepting only its own notes for federal taxes, creating an uneven playing field. By 1785, Pennsylvania’s legislature repealed its state charter, limiting its operations, and it eventually transitioned into a private bank. This early experiment highlighted tensions between centralized financial power and local interests, setting the stage for future banking debates.

## The [[First Bank of the United States|First Bank of the United States]] (1791–1811)

The [[First Bank of the United States|First Bank of the United States]] was chartered by Congress on February 25, 1791, for 20 years, largely through the efforts of [[Alexander Hamilton]], the first Treasury Secretary. [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamilton]], a Federalist, envisioned a strong national economy driven by commerce and industry, with a central bank to stabilize currency, manage federal debt, and facilitate tax collection. The bank was capitalized at $10 million, with the federal government owning 20% of the stock and appointing 20% of its directors, while private investors, including some foreigners, held the majority. It was located in Philadelphia, with branches in major cities like Boston, New York, and New Orleans.

### Controversies and [[Thomas Jefferson]]’s Criticism

The [[First Bank of the United States|First Bank]] was deeply controversial, with [[Thomas Jefferson]], Secretary of State, and James Madison leading the opposition. [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]], a Democratic-Republican, advocated for an agrarian-based economy and strict constitutional interpretation. He argued the bank was unconstitutional, as the Constitution did not explicitly grant Congress the power to create a corporation or national bank. Citing the Tenth Amendment, he believed such powers belonged to the states or the people. [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]] also feared the bank would favor northern commercial interests over southern agrarian ones, concentrating wealth among urban elites and encouraging speculation rather than productive labor. He viewed it as a tool for corruption, accusing [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamilton]] of designing a system to manipulate legislators through financial interests.

[[Alexander Hamilton|Hamilton]] countered that the bank was constitutional under the Necessary and Proper Clause (Article I, Section 8), arguing it was essential for executing Congress’s fiscal powers. He emphasized that the bank, as a private entity, could perform functions the government could not refuse to an “artificial person” (a corporation). President George Washington, after consulting his cabinet, signed the bill into law, siding with [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamilton]] despite reservations from [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]] and Attorney General Edmund Randolph.

The bank’s operations were successful, stabilizing the currency and managing federal debt, but its foreign ownership (notably by European investors, including rumored ties to the [[Rothschilds|Rothschild family]]) fueled suspicions of external influence. While no direct evidence confirms significant Rothschild control, their prominence in European banking led to speculation about their involvement, a theme echoed by modern critics like [[Whitney Webb]] and [[Ryan Dawson]], who argue that foreign bankers sought to influence American finance from the nation’s founding.

In 1811, the bank’s charter was not renewed, failing by a single vote in Congress. Vice President George Clinton broke a Senate tie against renewal, reflecting widespread distrust of centralized banking and its perceived elitism. The War of 1812 soon exposed the lack of a national bank, as the government struggled to finance the conflict, prompting calls for a new institution.

The Second Bank of the United States (1816–1836)

The Second Bank of the United States was chartered in 1816, again for 20 years, to address the financial instability revealed by the War of 1812. Like its predecessor, it was a private corporation with 20% federal ownership and was tasked with managing federal deposits, issuing currency, and supervising state banks. It was headquartered in Philadelphia and operated branches nationwide. Initially, even opponents of centralized banking, like James Madison, reluctantly supported its creation due to wartime financial necessities.

[[Andrew Jackson]]’s Opposition and the Bank War

The Second Bank became a lightning rod for controversy under [[Andrew Jackson]], who assumed the presidency in 1829. Jackson, a populist, viewed the bank as an elitist institution that concentrated economic power among the wealthy, particularly in the Northeast, at the expense of farmers and the working class. He echoed [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]]’s concerns, arguing the bank was unconstitutional and favored foreign investors (again, with unproven but persistent rumors of Rothschild influence). Jackson’s 1832 veto of the bank’s recharter bill was a defining moment, portraying it as a “privileged” entity benefiting the rich and foreign interests over ordinary Americans.

Jackson’s campaign against the bank, known as the Bank War, was politically potent. He accused it of corrupting politics through lobbying and favoritism, pointing to its size (it dwarfed state banks) and stock ownership by wealthy investors. The bank’s president, Nicholas Biddle, fought to preserve it, but his efforts, including tightening credit to pressure Congress, backfired, reinforcing Jackson’s narrative of elitism. In 1833, Jackson withdrew federal deposits from the bank, placing them in state-chartered “pet banks,” effectively crippling it. The bank’s charter expired in 1836, marking the start of the Free Banking Era (1837–1863), during which state banks operated without a central authority, leading to an unstable currency system.

Rothschild Family and Foreign Influence

The Rothschild family’s alleged role in American banking during this period is a recurring theme in controversial narratives. While they were major players in European finance, direct evidence of their control over the First or Second Banks is limited. However, critics like Whitney Webb and Ryan Dawson argue that the Rothschilds, through their London and Paris branches, influenced American banking indirectly by financing government debt and investing in early U.S. securities. Webb, in her book One Nation Under Blackmail, suggests that European banking families sought leverage over U.S. institutions, though she relies on circumstantial connections rather than definitive proof. Dawson, in his lectures and videos, claims the Rothschilds backed efforts to establish centralized banking to control American monetary policy, a view echoed in posts on X. These claims, while plausible given the Rothschilds’ global reach, often lack primary documentation and are debated by mainstream historians.

Lincoln, Alexander II, and Financial Controversies

The period between the Second Bank’s demise and the Federal Reserve’s creation saw significant financial turmoil, including during [[Abraham Lincoln]]’s presidency (1861–1865). The Civil War necessitated massive government borrowing, and Lincoln faced pressure from private bankers, including those with European ties, to finance the war through high-interest loans. Critics like [[Ian Carroll]] and [[Ryan Dawson]] argue that Lincoln’s issuance of greenbacks—government-backed paper currency not tied to specie (gold or silver)—was a direct challenge to private banking interests, including the Rothschilds, who allegedly sought to control U.S. finances through debt.

Lincoln and Greenbacks

In 1862 and 1863, Congress passed the Legal Tender Acts, authorizing greenbacks to fund the war without relying on private banks. This move was controversial, as it bypassed traditional banking channels and angered financiers who profited from government bonds. [[Ian Carroll|Carroll]], in his podcast discussions, suggests Lincoln’s greenback policy made him a target of banking elites, though evidence linking this to his assassination is speculative. Dawson goes further, alleging that European bankers, including the Rothschilds, opposed Lincoln’s monetary independence, drawing parallels to Alexander II of Russia, who also resisted centralized banking and issued state-controlled currency during the same period.

Alexander II of Russia and Alleged Connections

Alexander II, who ruled Russia from 1855 to 1881, pursued financial reforms that reduced reliance on foreign bankers, including the Rothschilds, who had financed Russian debt. Some alternative historians, like Dawson, claim that both Lincoln and Alexander II were assassinated (Lincoln in 1865, Alexander II in 1881) due to their resistance to international banking cartels. These theories often cite the Rothschilds’ influence in European finance and their alleged desire to control global monetary systems. However, mainstream historians dismiss these claims as conspiratorial, noting that both leaders faced domestic political enemies (Lincoln from Confederate sympathizers, Alexander II from revolutionary groups) with clearer motives for their assassinations. No definitive evidence links their deaths to banking conspiracies, though the narrative persists in works by figures like Webb and Dawson.

The Free Banking Era and the Panic of 1907

From 1837 to 1863, the Free Banking Era saw state-chartered banks proliferate, issuing their own notes with varying reserve requirements. This led to an unstable currency, as banknotes often traded at discounts based on the issuing bank’s reliability. By 1863, the National Banking Acts created a more uniform currency system backed by U.S. government bonds, but the lack of a central bank persisted.

The Panic of 1907, a severe financial crisis, exposed the fragility of this system. Bank runs and liquidity shortages highlighted the need for a lender of last resort and an elastic currency that could respond to economic fluctuations. The crisis prompted the creation of the National Monetary Commission, led by Senator Nelson Aldrich, which studied European central banks and proposed a centralized banking system. The Aldrich Plan, developed in a secretive 1910 meeting at Jekyll Island with bankers like J.P. Morgan and Paul Warburg, called for a private central bank with minimal government oversight. It faced opposition from Democrats and populists, who saw it as a “Money Trust” benefiting Wall Street.

The Federal Reserve Act of 1913

The Federal Reserve Act, signed by President Woodrow Wilson on December 23, 1913, established the Federal Reserve System as the U.S. central bank. It was a compromise between the Aldrich Plan’s banker-driven model and populist demands for government control. Crafted by Representative Carter Glass and Senator Robert L. Owen, the act created a decentralized system of 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks, overseen by a Federal Reserve Board appointed by the president. Its goals were to provide an elastic currency, supervise banks, and prevent panics.

The act passed the House 298–60 and the Senate 43–25, with most Democrats in favor and Republicans opposed. Critics like Representative Charles Lindbergh Sr. called it a disguised version of the Aldrich Plan, arguing it gave bankers too much control over interest rates and currency issuance. Wilson insisted on a public board to balance private influence, but the system’s structure—a mix of public and private elements—remained contentious.

Controversies and Modern Critics

The Federal Reserve’s creation has long been a lightning rod for criticism. [[Thomas Jefferson]]’s earlier warnings about centralized banking’s dangers echoed in 20th-century debates, with critics arguing it concentrated economic power in the hands of private bankers. The Rothschild family and other foreign bankers were again implicated in conspiracies, with figures like Darryl Cooper, [[Candace Owens]], and Dave Smith questioning the Fed’s origins. Cooper, on his Martyrmade podcast, frames the Fed as a tool for financial elites to control monetary policy, citing its secretive founding at Jekyll Island. Owens, in her public talks, has suggested the Fed serves globalist interests, though her claims often lack specific evidence. Smith, a libertarian comedian and podcaster, criticizes the Fed for enabling inflation and government overreach, echoing [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]]’s fears of economic centralization.

[[Dr. Jack Kruse|Jack Kruse]], a neurosurgeon, ties the Fed to broader systemic issues, arguing it facilitates debt-based economies that harm societal health, though his focus is more on health than banking specifics. David Irvine, less prominent in this context, discusses centralized power in broader terms, aligning with anti-establishment critiques. [[Whitney Webb]] and Ryan Dawson offer more detailed analyses, with Webb’s investigative work pointing to interlocking financial interests (including J.P. Morgan and Warburg) and Dawson alleging the Fed was designed to serve international banking cartels, including the Rothschilds. Both rely on historical patterns but face criticism for speculative leaps.

Mainstream historians counter that the Fed was a pragmatic response to financial instability, balancing public and private interests. While the Jekyll Island meeting was secretive, it involved prominent American bankers, not necessarily foreign conspirators. The Rothschilds’ direct influence remains unproven, though their European prominence fuels speculation.

Conclusion

The Federal Reserve’s development reflects a centuries-long struggle over centralized banking in the U.S. The [[First Bank of the United States]] (1781) and [[First Bank of the United States|First Bank]] (1791) laid the groundwork but faced opposition from figures like [[Thomas Jefferson]], who saw them as unconstitutional and elitist. The Second Bank (1816) intensified these debates, culminating in [[Andrew Jackson]]’s populist crusade against it. The Free Banking Era and Panic of 1907 underscored the need for reform, leading to the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, a compromise that created a hybrid public-private system. Controversies involving Lincoln and Alexander II remain speculative, with no conclusive evidence tying their policies or deaths to banking conspiracies. Modern critics like Darryl Cooper, Ian Carroll, Candace Owens, Dave Smith, [[Dr. Jack Kruse|Jack Kruse]], [[David Irvine]], [[Whitney Webb]], and [[Ryan Dawson]] revive these debates, questioning the Fed’s origins and influence, often implicating foreign bankers like the Rothschilds. While their critiques highlight legitimate concerns about concentrated power, they sometimes rely on unverified claims, underscoring the need for critical examination of both alternative and establishment narratives.
