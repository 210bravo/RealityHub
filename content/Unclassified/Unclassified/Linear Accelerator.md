Linear Accelerator and SV40 Experiments

[[Jack Kruse, MD|Kruse]] connects the polio vaccine and SV40 to secretive experiments involving a linear accelerator, particularly in the context of Dr. [[Mary Sherman]]’s work in New Orleans. His perspective includes:

- Purpose of Experiments: Kruse claims that in 1963, Dr. [[Mary Sherman]], under the direction of Dr. [[Alton Ochsner]], conducted top-secret experiments at the Public Health Service Hospital in New Orleans using a linear accelerator to irradiate SV40. The stated goal, according to Kruse, was to develop a vaccine to prevent an epidemic of soft-tissue cancers caused by SV40 contamination in polio vaccines. However, he alleges the true purpose was to create a mutated, highly virulent SV40 strain as a biological weapon, potentially for use in assassinating Fidel Castro. Kruse draws on Edward Haslam’s book Dr. Mary’s Monkey to support this claim, suggesting Sherman, David Ferrie, and Judyth Baker were involved in irradiating SV40 to produce a “galloping cancer” that could kill within weeks.
- Linear Accelerator’s Role: The linear accelerator, a high-voltage device used to bombard particles with radiation, was allegedly used to mutate SV40, enhancing its pathogenicity. Kruse speculates that Sherman’s death in 1964 (officially ruled a murder but possibly an accidental electrocution from the accelerator) was linked to these experiments, suggesting a cover-up to conceal the project’s true nature. He frames this as part of a CIA-orchestrated effort, with Oswald as a courier to smuggle the weaponized virus to Cuba.
- Broader Implications: Kruse ties these experiments to a larger narrative of bioweapons development and elite control. He suggests the linear accelerator experiments may have inadvertently or deliberately contributed to the AIDS epidemic, as mutated viruses could have escaped containment or been misused. This claim, drawn from Haslam’s work, lacks mainstream scientific support but aligns with Kruse’s view of medical research being co-opted for nefarious purposes.
