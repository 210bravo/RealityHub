The asthenosphere is a semi-molten, ductile, and mechanically weak layer in the Earth's upper mantle, located beneath the lithosphere. It plays a crucial role in plate tectonics by allowing the lithospheric plates to move and deform. The asthenosphere is characterized by low seismic wave velocities, high attenuation, and high electrical conductivity, often attributed to partial melting and water content.
