This is a brief overview of MOCs. An M—O—C is a cluster of information that maps "things" in context with other "things".

- MOC stands for **Maps of Content** because these notes _map_ the contents of some of your notes.
- MOC is pronounced `EM-OH-CEE`.
- MOCs help you gather, develop, and navigate ideas.
