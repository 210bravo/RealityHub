## Summary

[[Tristan Scott]], Head of Operations & Marketing at [[Daylight Computer Co]]., discusses the health risks of non-native electromagnetic fields ([[nnEMFs]]) from [[5G]], Wi-Fi, and cell phone radiation. Scott argues that [[Non-Native Electromagnetic Fields|nnEMFs]] disrupt human biology, contributing to chronic diseases like [[cancer]], leukemia, and mitochondrial dysfunction. He critiques the telecom industry’s funding of biased research to downplay these risks and highlights historical experiments, such as military EMF studies, to support his claims. The episode explores practical mitigation strategies, like minimizing [[Non-Native Electromagnetic Fields|nnEMF]] exposure and using circadian-friendly technologies, while addressing regulatory failures, such as the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Scott’s work at Daylight Computer Co. emphasizes low-EMF devices to reduce health risks, aligning with a decentralized approach to health.

### Key Concepts Discussed

1. Electromagnetic Spectrum and nnEMFs (00:03:42, The Electromagnetic Spectrum and Natural Exposure; 00:09:51, Understanding Non-Native EMFs and the Different Types):
    
    - Scott explains the electromagnetic spectrum, distinguishing natural EMFs (e.g., sunlight, Earth’s magnetic field) from nnEMFs (e.g., [[5G]], Wi-Fi, cell phones). nnEMFs, unlike natural EMFs, are pulsed and polarized, disrupting cellular processes like voltage-gated calcium channels, which regulate cellular signaling.
    - He cites biological impacts, including oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxin accumulation, leading to chronic diseases (01:11:54, Cumulative Effects of Mitochondrial Toxins).
        
2. Health Risks of [[5G]] and Wi-Fi (00:18:38, Introduction to 5G and its Infrastructure; 00:25:29, Beamforming and the Directionality of 5G Waves; 00:43:43, The Overwhelming Evidence of Harmful Effects):
    
    - [[5G]]’s high-frequency millimeter waves and beamforming technology increase exposure intensity, potentially causing DNA damage, leukemia, and pregnancy complications (00:54:30, Evidence of Harmful Effects on Pregnancy; 00:55:14, EMFs & Leukemia). Scott references the National Toxicology Program (NTP) and Ramazzini studies, which found “clear evidence” of cancer in rats exposed to cell phone radiation (00:52:04, The NTP Study and the Ramazzini Study;).
    - Wi-Fi and cell phone radiation disrupt water structure in cells, affecting mitochondrial function and increasing apoptosis (01:04:55, Cell Oscillation and Water Disruption).
        
3. Telecom Industry and Regulatory Failures (00:50:02, Telecom-funded EMF Studies; 01:13:30, [[Robert F Kennedy Jr|RFK]] & the Telecommunications Act of 1996):
    
    - Scott alleges the telecom industry funds biased research to obscure nnEMF risks, citing “[[Phonegate]],” where cell phones exceeded radiation safety limits (00:40:40, Phonegate;). He criticizes the 1996 Telecommunications Act, influenced by [[Robert F Kennedy Jr|RFK Jr]].’s early advocacy, for limiting local governments’ ability to regulate cell towers based on health concerns.
    - Regulatory bodies like the FCC are accused of ignoring evidence, prioritizing industry interests over public health.
        
4. Military EMF Experiments and Directed Energy Weapons (00:31:59, Military EMF Experiments; 01:40:04, Military Directed Energy Weapons):
    
    - Scott discusses historical military experiments with EMFs, suggesting they explored nnEMFs for biological effects, potentially as weapons. These experiments indicate early awareness of nnEMF’s health impacts, suppressed by government and industry (01:48:42, Electricity is Causing Chronic Disease).
    - He connects this to modern directed energy weapons, implying a continuity of nnEMF misuse.
        
5. Blue Light Toxicity (00:21:25, Why [[Blue Light]] is Toxic):
    
    - Blue light from screens and LEDs, a form of nnEMF, disrupts melatonin production and circadian rhythms, contributing to metabolic and neurological issues. Scott advocates circadian-friendly lighting, as promoted by his company, Daylight Computer Co. (01:22:21, Daylight Computer;).
    
6. Practical Mitigation Strategies (01:15:06, Practical Steps to Mitigate 5G):
    
    - Scott recommends reducing nnEMF exposure by using wired connections, turning off Wi-Fi at night, keeping phones in airplane mode, and using EMF-blocking devices (e.g., laptop pads, blue blockers;). He promotes Daylight Computer Co.’s low-EMF devices to minimize blue light and radiation exposure.
    - Other strategies include grounding, maximizing sunlight exposure, and avoiding nnEMF-heavy environments like urban areas with dense 5G networks.
        
7. Lack of Public Awareness and Education (00:58:27, Lack of Warning Labels and Education; 00:59:26, Absence of Evidence vs. Evidence of Absence):
    
    - Scott criticizes the absence of warning labels on cell phones and public education about nnEMF risks, attributing this to industry lobbying. He emphasizes the precautionary principle, arguing that transgenerational health effects (e.g., on pregnancy) necessitate action despite incomplete evidence (01:00:50, Transgenerational Effects and Precautionary Principle).
        
8. Chronic Disease and Human Resilience (01:48:42, Electricity is Causing Chronic Disease; 02:01:30, The Resilience of Human Life):
    
    - nnEMFs are implicated in rising chronic disease rates, including cancer and infertility, due to cumulative mitochondrial stress. Scott highlights human resilience, noting that lifestyle changes can mitigate some effects, but long-term exposure remains a concern.

### Critical Examination

Scott’s claims about nnEMF health risks are supported by studies like the NTP and Ramazzini findings, which show cancer in rats exposed to cell phone radiation. However, mainstream science, including EPA guidelines, states that nnEMFs are non-ionizing and lack sufficient energy to break DNA directly, with mixed evidence on long-term effects. The NTP study’s relevance to humans is debated due to high exposure levels not typical of daily use. Scott’s allegations of telecom-funded research bias are plausible, given historical industry tactics (e.g., tobacco;), but lack specific evidence in the episode. His discussion of military EMF experiments and directed energy weapons is intriguing but speculative, as no declassified documents are cited. Blue light’s impact on circadian rhythms is well-documented (Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, 2010), but its link to nnEMF-specific diseases needs further validation. Critics on X and Reddit note Scott’s practical advice but question alarmist claims, urging skepticism of conspiracy narratives without robust data.

## Transcript:

[[Tristan Scott]] Nice to meet you bro Thanks for having me man So uh tell the world what you just did to my house You just basically ran all your crazy meters and found out that me and my wife are are barbecuing ourselves every night when we go to sleep Yeah we did a little [[Non-Native Electromagnetic Fields|EMF]] testing So I had a radio frequency meter um that is testing the power density of radio frequency EMFs We had a multimemeter to specifically look at AC body voltage which is the electric fields from your electrical power inducing an AC voltage on your body which to me is a great way to test um how high of EMF exposure from the power frequencies you're getting Yeah You're not working at home You're pretty much coming home you know lounging and then going to bed right so eating and sleeping and is basically all I do at home Yeah So the sleep sanctuary for me is is most important because you can not avoid EMF exposure at all You definitely have less control during the day when you need to get work done But if you can go home and get a restorative night of sleep that's when you're going through cell repair That's when you're mitigating the damage that you just incurred throughout the whole day So if you're going home and sleeping in a super hot bedroom in regards to EMFs and you're looking at a blue lit screen right before bed you're really not going to sleep as well So you might be getting the numbers in terms of hours but you're not getting the quality And that's why we're seeing some of these chronic diseases younger and younger So what we did was we measured the RFS in specific areas and we found out that you the cameras you have for your children's bedroom the baby monitor especially in your bedroom was a super high source of radio frequencies I was actually shocked because unlike a cell phone which is very pulse like every 8 to 10 seconds let's say it hits this peak that baby monitor in your room seemed to be almost consistent and it was right on your wife's nightstand so it was at like 100,000 microwatts per meter squared which is very very high Um that's that's pretty much the power density of a you know output out outgoing cell phone transmission like constantly Right here it's at it's going from 75 jumping from 40 48,000 to 87,000 112,000 That was on the bed like a foot away That was a couple feet away from the baby monitor So that's a problem because that's what you're sleeping next to Oh look 403,000 Yeah that was right next to the baby monitor Yeah And that's what you're sleeping next to pretty much all night long So we can get into why that's a problem but we we did our best to mitigate that And and what I was preaching earlier is that really distance is your best friend because electromagnetic waves and fields have inverse square law So if you put a 2x or a 3x distance between you and the source you actually two square which is four three square which is nine reduce the intensity of that field So even putting a foot even putting a few inches away from the source like your phone like that baby monitor like your Wi-Fi router can make a tremendous difference So we what did we agree on we agreed to you should put the baby monitor across the room side of the room Yeah And then we're also phones on airplane mode Phone's on airplane mode But you have to turn it just it tricks you You can't just turn on airplane mode It doesn't do [ __ ] You got to turn off your Wi-Fi and then you got to go into the settings and turn off your Bluetooth to make the difference You got to make sure that when you press airplane mode they all go off and they have that striketh through on the setting shortcut cuz if they just go from like blue to white they're not actually off which I don't even know why Apple does that It's insane Um but that's one or you just keep the phones out of the bedroom charging in in the other room So that's the radio frequency realm We also experimented with putting tin foil and a Faraday beanie on your Wi-Fi router Agreed that you probably since your kids bedrooms are closer to the Wi-Fi router You can get like a $30 Faraday bag If you don't want to turn the Wi-Fi off at night which is best case solution cuz you have cameras for baby monitoring or security cameras You can buy a Faraday bag which will reduce it like 70 to 85 90% to me is a lot is is a great in between um low hanging fruit Yeah I think we got to get I think we're we're going to upgrade to uh hardwired security cameras instead of those Wi-Fi ones I think that would make probably a huge difference and as well as that Faraday bag And then uh also definitely figuring out a way to turn off the breaker panel that connects to our bedroom and just use we found like in my bathroom we can plug everything into my bathroom wire it into the bed and you know just move it into the bedroom [ __ ] that we actually need and it still reduces it by like what was it like 10,000 or something yeah So what we were measuring there was as I said the body voltage So that's the electric field inducing a voltage on your body and your body's like semiconductive So that's why that happens It's a great way to get an idea of the EMFs uh from from the power frequencies from the electrical power in your sleep environment So what we did was we measured it before and after turning the power off So you were between 2,000 3,000 molts on your bed 2 to 3 volts AC Again this number in nature should be zero Uh there's no AC voltage uh in nature So you want it as close to zero as possible Uh I think my bedroom is like 100 molts.1 volts It's hard to sometimes get below that unless literally all the circuits in your house are you're in Wyoming Yeah But again I think what I you know what we talked about here is for me that stuff is important What's external like Yeah If there's a cell tower nearby 5G tower you know if there's a substation transmission lines really close by that's a problem But the immediate air environment what you have with your own technology is more important almost 99% of the time because it's just that much closer So we turn the circuit breaker off to your bedroom and you went from 2 to 3 volts to 0.2.25 volts on your bed a it's a 10x reduction in the amount of AC voltage being induced on your body and that's just by by flipping the breaker off So and what does that actually do to the body though when all that AC voltage is running through do we know we don't know We have no clue We we know we have studies just talking about maybe it makes you live longer Yeah it could if you harnessed it correctly potentially No the the problem is that's that's crystals and you know it's high power stuff um you know that's that's 60 volts or sorry 60 hertz and and pretty high voltage Your body is operating on very small scale in in terms of the intensity of the fields the intensity of the currents that are running through it the intensity of of the voltage So uh to give you indication the voltage which is a proton gradient across your mitochondrial membrane is around 150 molts Um so it's it's pretty small in comparison to what we have you know powering our lives today And although that does sum up because you have trillions of mitochondria in your body that's debatably what being alive means is that collective voltage across all your mitochondria and all your cells is like 30 trillion volts But that's um you know divided across every single mitochondrial membrane And that's why this is also fascinating because people might already be listening to this like what are they talking about we're talking about how your electromagnetic environment is affecting your biology affecting your health And there are a lot of studies out there since you know across the whole 20th century showing potential biological effects that are negative and they span a swath of different end side effects But it comes down to really like oxidative stress mitochondrial dysfunction and the most like electromagnetic active energetic areas of our biology being compromised And it just happens to coincide with this proliferation of chronic disease and chronic fatigue and and people are maybe not considering this as a large reason for that And I would say that would be a big bit ignorant and I want to you know bring more attention to this topic But the problem is it's very inconvenient Very very very inconvenient for people to have another toxin to deal with and one that guess what they really can't do anything about and they probably have the least consent to overall and is what's powering our lives on It's also the one that's the least obvious It's invisible It's invisible You don't It's like it's so easy to forget about intangible invisible Unless you were an engineer or a physicist or took high level like physics in high school you probably wouldn't even know what an electromagnetic field is And that's that's kind of why this all gets buried into the conspiracy theory tinfoil hat woo woo subject But in reality it's it's pure science It's pure physics And what are these lights you brought here i brought some portable incandescent lights because I wasn't satisfied with the lighting environment here The idea that when I travel it's great because um incandescent lights my opinion healthiest lights you Obama banned those Right Yeah They've been on the chopping block for a while now So they're they're banned from manufacturing in the United States There's a 45 lumen per watt um efficiency standard by the Department of Energy So that is measuring the amount of brightness um versus the amount of power that's required to um uh power the bulbs The Department of Energy Yeah Yeah And that's the same the same company that was renamed three times after it was originally called the Manhattan Project Sure Yeah Um the company that made the [ __ ] atomic bomb Department of Energy Yeah Yeah Okay I didn't I didn't know that But um the problem is they have a standard that is completely ignorant of the fact that infrared light is vitally important for our biology and our health and all life on this planet Sunlight is 50 to 55% infrared light from an energy perspective 70% infrared light from a photons per second perspective And when we switch to LEDs that goes to zero When we're inside behind energy efficient glass all that gets a lot of that gets filtered out So what I like to do with incandescent and Steve is pulling up some nice spectrums here Yeah this is what you were showing me at the house a minute ago Yeah we measured it with the spectrometer It's rich in long wavelength low energy light that is very very beneficial for our biology It does things like stimulates melatonin production in the mitochondria to actually balance the oxidative response from higher energy wavelengths such as blue violet and UV And we're deficient in infrared light So the incandescent put that back So I'm a much bigger fan of incandescent infrared maxing as opposed to blocking blue light during the day Yeah And so so you were just at my house and you gave me um a new incandescent bulb for one of my lamps And when you when you first scanned the lamp with the LED bulb it looked exactly like the one on the left with that huge blue spike Then when he did it Yeah with the incandescent bulb it looked exactly like the one on the right And we went outside in the sunlight It looked more like the incandescent chart on the right Well it's it's it looked like the one on the left here that's showing the sunlight which is full spectrum So you get a lot of you know violet you get ultraviolet you get everything You get everything from ultraviolet to infrared And these spectrometer images don't even capture most of the infrared spectrum It's the infrared spectrum goes from like 750 nm to tens of micrometers Like it it's very vast And the visible spectrum is very narrow It's like 300 nm So the majority of what you're taking in from sunlight is is infrared There you go That's Steve If we lit our studio with these incandescent lights what what would be the downside it would cost more money Uh yeah So I mean I've lit tons of studios It just takes like hundreds and hundred thousands of watts Like so if I were to use So for the key light back there I'd probably use a 2K or a couple 1Ks Uh like minimum I'd probably do like a like Yeah probably a 2K or maybe 4,000 Get really hot right yeah that So that is the infrared light You know it's it's not as great down here in in Florida but in Wyoming when it's too cold for me to work outside or it's like a snowing or something I have a 250 W chicken lamp which is just a 250 W incandescent bulb next to my indoor work setup and I just blast that on me all day long I It makes such a difference Really yeah Such a And you want to talk about red light therapy well you were talking that a little bit about your house the red LEDs and the red light panels Those are great Sure photobiomodulation but they're like two wavelengths or or three maybe whereas sun is all of the wavelengths in the visible so many wavelengths in the infrared So I'm a big fan of broadspectctrum light And Jack was in here He was like "You guys areing up You need to take the roof off this building Open up that wall You guys are blowing it You could just open the windows." Um there's no windows in here Oh we're in a spaceship Have you noticed yeah I did notice It's kind of tripping me out I tried the best I could Uh we have full spectrum uh cinema uh LED You know what I like here that we're not being assaulted with some like highowered LED or fluorescent light So just that light pretty much Yeah That and that's not bad at all Like I I think this is much better and it won't be as draining as as being blast with those you know typical bright lights you have in like a studio setup But yeah that's the trade-off And it's crazy because it's all about energy efficiency when that you know energy that's you know invisible and therefore contributing nothing to brightness which is driving those standards is so so important for for our health and those standards the DOE is going to 120 lumens per watt in 2028 unless the new administration changes that So I would say the DOE is going to 120 lumens per watt Can you what does that mean in English it means it's the standards for efficiency are tripling in and how stringent they are by 2028 So even current solutions that just get by like warmer LEDs or um you know there's a optics engineer who I'm great friends with who's done a lot of this research on infrared named Scott Zimmerman He has a company that does a hybrid LED and infrared bulb That will no longer be legal because they have tripled the standard So even the current LEDs are not efficient enough So what does that mean this episode is brought to you by Square the all-in-one point of sale payment and inventory system If people have to interact with your business Square makes it happen Whether you're running a cafe a salon or selling UFOs to people on the street Square is simple easy and takes the headache out of the business Who doesn't love Square everyone uses it from small momand pop food trucks to big legitimate businesses Even jewelry stores use Square I love it because you can use your credit card your debit card your Apple Pay whatever it is It's simple userfriendly and super easy to interact with whether you're the vendor or the customer They started as card readers that plugged into your phone but now you just tap to pay That makes it super flexible with how businesses choose to operate And of course Square includes all the tools to manage and monitor your business too You can even set up an online store if you're

Square Get started today It's linked below Now back to the show what are the most you know bright and most efficient wavelengths the high energy blue um violet um green So that there's going to be more of those wavelengths and less of the lower energy longer wavelengths to balance that So it's just going to be more distorted more unbalanced and worse for our health Can you search for something about the Department of Energy with light bulbs and wattage output mandates find find something about that because that's fascinating that that that they would be putting this stuff into play into place US Department of Energy fin uh finalized new energy efficiency standards for general service lamps which include common residential and commercial light bulbs take effect in July 2028 Wow For newly uh produced bulbs These standards will require bulbs to produce more than 120 lumens But you wereing spot on bro Up to the current standard of 45 lumens per watt The updated standards are uh these updated standards are expected to save American families $1.6 billion dollar annually on household energy costs and reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions over 30 years The DOE project projects uh the DOE projects these standards will save Americans more than 27 billion on utility bills and cut 70 million uh metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions Um holy [ __ ] But that's nonsense because guess what happened in the last 20 years we have so much more light at night So even though we've switched from incandescent to LEDs yes they are more efficient We're using just way more lights So we're pretty much like just net neutral in terms of we haven't really saved any energy We haven't saved any money We just have more efficient lights and we use more lights like throughout the day Whereas if we switch back to incandescent and again who needs that many lights on during the day not you shouldn't really let's get more you know natural light from the outdoors and then at night time you just have some lowowered incandescent it's it's really such a narrative spin and of course the entire energy efficiency um you know greenhouse gas situation is it it it's a giant ploy to just move to this like higher efficiency smarter life but there's It's at such a cost So the Department of Energy used to be called the Atomic Energy Commission and before that it was called the Manhattan Project I didn't know that This is the same people who made the [ __ ] thermonuclear bomb bro Well it's not the same people It's like seven years ago right well it's the same organization Corruption I mean every threeletter agency we can we can talk about that It's the FCC They're all It's all the same So this is like okay I'm trying to I'm trying to see if I can play the devil's advocate here and see like what would be the downside The devil's advocate sorry to interrupt I I asked a coworker in San Francisco He said their price per kilowatt hour is 45 That's insane That for these for no for electricity they're paying 45ents a kilowatt hour So I don't know if you ever looked at your electricity bill You're probably paying 10 to 15 cents a kilowatt hour which is like a reasonable amount So they're basically paying like 3x what you're paying in electricity So to put incandescent in their house is going to cost a lot more money Again if they have their lights on all the time like 45 Why are they paying 45 because the utility companies and uh in San Francisco in in California are a joke That's why Oh yeah in utility companies in general it's this weird you know public service utility for a p for a public good but there they're quasi private companies So the it's the same thing like in Europe right now you know with all the natural gas issues and and the Russia Ukraine war like the price of electricity in like Germany is is similar It's like 40 to 60 cents a kilowatt hour So they've b they banned incandescent a long time ago Um and that's all about energy efficiency Um but it's not practical And that's where the whole energy generation and energy consumption conversation is so important for society But we should not be compromising because no one is acknowledging how important light is for our health And if we just spent more time outside or got more outside light indoors then we wouldn't even have to worry about how efficient our our lights actually are And at what cost you know $1.6 billion Okay How many people have chronic disease and how much does that cost right Right Way more than that So what is the lowest hanging most obvious thing that these lights are doing to us that we know of that's been like studied or is being investigated or has been written about whatever or that interested you originally the good or the bad lights the bad the bad lights Yeah Yeah What is like the those so if we do if they do implement that those lights um with the new the highest most energy efficient blue lights possibly ever created by human beings and we're not allowed to use these kind of lights what would happen to to the human body we would just have more oxidative stress more mitochondrial dysfunction which leads to pretty much all chronic diseases Uh because it's unbalanced Like I said the the higher energy wavelengths are are higher energy So they come at a cost at the cellular level So blue light is is blue light's vitally important for our biology We go outside in the morning Blue light is what wakes us up It stimulates cortisol production It suppresses melatonin in the moment and it provides a more dopamineergic response like go and do stuff sees the day hunt gather food etc So it's very important But all of that and then the violet ultraviolet which is also extremely important for our biology Uh but it happens to also have this oxidative response The red and the infrared longer wavelengths penetrate deep into our cells They stimulate melatonin production which is the master antioxidant and it cleans up all of the free radicals and a lot of the oxidative stress that's being occurred from the higher energy wavelengths And melatonin even you know upregulates glutathione and other antioxidants It's it's a miracle I mean it's agreed upon pretty much And melatonin is like anti-cancer But now what like Scott Zimmerman and these researchers found it's it's not just about what you're producing at night from a melatonin perspective It's about what you're producing during the day from exposure to mostly near infrared light When you're inside all day you're getting no infrared light Is it true that when in in the morning when you're outside during the sunrise I guess there's like a couple hours in the morning before the UVB light kicks in where you're getting that red light from the sunrise produces that uh the um [[Melanopsin]] is that right which also produces melatonin that automatically with our body with the circadian rhythm When you get that light in your eyes in the morning it knows 12 hours later you're going to start putting you to sleep Yeah So light is the main input signal to set our circadian rhythms And out of all the light blue light is the main sight gabber or time giver So blue light is the main clock signal for our bodies And that's because of [[Melanopsin]] That's because of the photo receptors how they've been designed And that's why it's so important But so would it work if I just woke up at 6:00 a.m and just put my phone in my face that would wake you up But because it's so stressful and not balanced Yeah So that's the cost here It's an unbalanced spectrum So you never get blue without red and infrared You never get UV without red and infrared And they've done studies in isolation looking at just blue light And it it damages the mitochondria in the retina Um like they they die off at a far higher rate The oxidative stress free radical production skyrockets And then they've also done it with red light as well And that has actually a positive effect So you never get one without the other in nature and that's all we need to do And that's why like incandescents are great because they're adding back in infrared to the indoors That's a crazy thing that I've re that I've noticed and read about over the last couple years is how that red light therapy those light panels can actually reverse uh poor eyesight and regenerate visual uh neurons Yeah it's insane And if we got outside and you can do that too And it's just the whole indoor environment being toxic from a light perspective EMF perspective and just spatial perspective Like our eyes you could say that eyes are kind of the the most prevalent health issue in the world today because of modern technology I mean in East Asia they have like 90% rates of myopia for for young kids And that's 90 90 That's insane And it's because we're indoors all day looking at devices six to 12 inches in front of us that simultaneously have a lot of blue light and no red and infrared Right so that's the cost really And then there's a flicker component as well to LEDs So that's an underrated stressor to me But pretty much all LEDs are flickering at a certain frequency I would say overhead lighting the flicker is not as bad as from your phone screen Phones are above and beyond the worst Right So if you've ever wondered why staring at your phone is way worse than staring at your MacBook it's because of the flicker It's not just because of the blue light because the frequency they use to the reason why it flickers is because um that's what's used to control brightness So they use a electronics control mechanism called pulsewidth modulation and that controls the brightness So instead of just like lowering the amount of current they're pushing through the the diode that light emmitting diode uh instead they turn it on and then they turn it off So that has a more consistent output of like color especially at lower brightness and just a higher precision for control So instead of literally the dimmer switch just turning it down in terms of current like you would um with normal things it's literally just cycling it on and off and increasing the amount of time off versus the amount of time on to get to lower brightness And on phones that's happening at a frequency in the hundreds of hertz range which is just above visual perception and it drives your brain and eyes crazy And this is known side effects You can look up like electrical engineering standards even agree flickering LEDs cause causes ice strain headaches migraines aggravates symptoms uh in ASD autism children uh panic attacks anxiety and guess what every single phone display and pretty much every LED light is is powered or is controlled with pulse with modul How did you learn about all this [ __ ] uh so I'm an electrical engineer by by degree who became obsessed with health because I had one too many concussions Uh how did you get concussions uh I played soccer in college So most of them from that and then last one that put me over the edge I didn't even know I was concussed Just like passed out and hit my head did everything wrong in that acute recovery phase So went down the rabbit hole Um and I was fascinated with health and you know my mom's from Austria I grew up in the outdoors It's like I love the outdoors and yeah just kept going down these rabbit holes and and realized quickly that we're just so disconnected from nature and that's a large reason why we're so unhealthy and that there's a big electromagnetic you know piece to this conversation Like I started with the food I started with the plastics I wrote a book half about regenerative agriculture and food and then I just was like "Hey these people online are talking about like EMFs and grounding and stuff." And honestly they don't know what they're talking about because they've never clearly taken a physics course And I see these like pendants and neutralizing Oh my god dude If I had a dollar for every [ __ ] influencer I talked about grounding on my Instagram feed I'd be I'd have It's blown up now And now yeah it's blown up now And for me I was like "Wow I have an opportunity here I'm electrical engineer to actually bridge these worlds of you know electromagnetism and biology which are so siloed." Um because all the electrical engineers and physicists are just in their lane and then the biology doctors practitioners are in their lane They don't cross at all And yeah I just got really fascinated started reading a lot of this research on these topics and just it made sense as to why on my own healing journey the more time I spent outdoors the more time I spent in environment closer to what exists in nature the better I felt And then you know 14 months ago I had Onjun on my podcast and he's you know talked about daylight I was like "Oh this is what I'm meant to do." And then joined him immediately because I was like "This is this is the last piece We could eat cleaner food We could wear you know natural fiber clothing We can get outdoors more." But to me technology is the most pervasive environmental toxin that exists and we have literally no alternative So that's what we're trying to fix at daylight Credit card debt has reached an all-time high and it's trapping Americans making it harder to pay off But there's one company that has become the light at the end of the tunnel and that's American Financing Prices for the last few years have been and continue to be high and most people unfortunately have to reach for credit cards to cover bills and expenses But this is not sustainable American Financing is helping homeowners pay off their highinterest debt by using the equity in their home American Financing is a family-owned mortgage lender that's been growing like crazy and it's licensed in all 50 states Their mortgage consultants are salarybased so there's no incentive to put you in a loan that won't work Their customers save on average of $800 a month and they don't charge any upfront or hidden fees You may be able to close in as fast as 10 days and may even be able to delay the mortgage payments up to two months during the process creating an extra bonus in savings upfront You can join hundreds of thousands of happy customers with meaningful savings by going to American financing Pretty cool if you ask me Go to americanfinancing.net/jones to get the best deal or call 8889952440 americanfancing.net/jones nmls182334 www.nmlsconsumerac.org Thank you American Financing for sponsoring this episode It's linked below Now back to the show That's wild dude I mean that's that's like like I said like what we were talking about like there's no there's no one who really knows a lot about this stuff And as far as I'm aware there's no like there's no like scientific peer-reviewed studies that have like happened in regards to exposing people to these radio frequencies these EMFs um 5G all this stuff right there there's sort of that that's like partially false and and partially true which pretty much means the same thing I guess Um they they've there's been so many studies on electromagnetic fields having biological effect like thousands If you saw the clip from RFK talking on Rogan oh yeah said there are thousand Joe there are thousands of studies G crosses the bloodb brain barrier Well you that study was from Alan Frey 1975 was funded by the US Navy for 15 years because guess who was interested in radar and microwaves the military So that's where a lot of this research in the ' 50s60s7s was all from the military and they were interested and there was some you know like sidebar [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|DARPA]] stuff to look at like what was going on in the Russian embassy which we can talk about but really um he found a lot of biological effects at low power density um and it just so happened that the frequencies he was looking at are the same exact frequencies being used for telecommunications today There's no way like we would have known But they're around 2 to four gigahertz They're called microwaves They're the same frequency as the radio you know communications we use probably just different modulation techniques Uh because they're not transmitting data like for cell phones They're like radar equipment And he found that it opens up the the bloodb brain barrier He found that it made uh rats very docile He found at a very low power density He stopped a frog's heart like completely from just exposure to who was doing this alan Frey He worked he worked for GE and he discovered he went down this rabbit hole cuz some like operator came to him was like "Hey man I can I can hear the radar." And he's like "What are you talking about?" He's like "No I can hear the radar Come check it out." And he could hear it too and they realized and they figured out that it it wasn't from the ears it was a a neurological response from the microwaves and Allan Frey And there's this whole debate literally a microwave debate in the ' 70s uh about this stuff uh especially because the the Russian embassy crisis people kind of got freaked out syndrome stuff There was a a GE uh another thing with ionizing radiation where TVs that GE made unfortunately had X-ray exposure by accident And so then the public became like very distrusting of technology for a little bit and then they kind of like was a big deal Well someone wrote a book called Zapping of America Paul Broaddor and then it kind of just went away Like they were like after the 70s just swept it under the rug and and no one's connected the dots since And now they're like well there's been no studies on 4G and 5G but a lot of biological effects have been studied for the same exact frequencies for decades And there's thousands of studies even since 1990 that are showing harmful biological effects Thousands But they're mostly on rodents A lot of them are epidemiological It's really hard to do studies on people with electromagnetic fields And some of the population-based studies that they've done have been you know pretty pretty damning Have you looked how how far how deep have you looked into the uh Havana syndrome stuff like the people that have these uh these symptoms of like really bad tenitus their ears ringing and like hearing voices in their heads crazy migraines like unbearable migraines People that that were in the uh the the embassy in Cuba and as well in Moscow that experienced this stuff I'm familiar with the Moscow signal and the Moscow embassy I've read a lot about that and that was basically it's it's funny This was like a big topic during the cold war cuz Russia Russia was very much aware or like stringent on electromagnetic fields and they had a thousand times stricter thresholds for microwave radio frequency safety and they you know we're in a cold war and for whatever reason they decided to to mock the US and blast the the embassy the US embassy in Moscow for over 15 years I think it was maybe even 20 years with a quote unquote low intensity Yeah here we go Low intensity signal in the microwave range 2.5 to 4 GHz which is exactly you know your Wi-Fi is at 2.4 GHz Your phone in in 5G mid-band is operating roughly in that area But these aren't So the difference is these were directed right these were shooting like a gun out of some sort of a device No it was just like on it was it was just being beamed from like a building onto the US embassy Oh like a big like a big wide blanket But this wasn't like hey we're doing this This was like what like they never have admitted to this day that they did this right so this So we have no idea how they actually have to like it It didn't necess like I would imagine that if I was some like the Russian intelligence agency KGB and I knew that the CIA was right across the street we could go in the building and we could get some sort of like crowd control device that shot [ __ ] 5G right at the building at a certain because it was directed at certain floors Yeah I think so Like there was only certain floors where people had those really bad symptoms Yeah Yeah And they did some weird like the US kind of freaked out but they couldn't tell anybody because they were like well it's under our safety threshold So they're in like a catch 22 and they started doing these side projects like project Pandora bizaar Project Pandora was they they took a couple monkeys and tested it with like five microwatts per centime squared which was 50% of the US's current safety threshold and they were just trying to figure out like is this actually dangerous and that's a re that's really high by the way That's like the maybe the peak transmission of your cell phone for 1 second They blasted these monkeys for 10 hours a day uh for 10 to 12 days straight And on like the 10th 11th 12th day the monkeys would straight up fall asleep like standing up and not wake up They would just be like zombies They they were performing all these tasks apparently and then eventually on like the 10th 11th 12th day they would just like basically be asleep but not asleep And then every time they did it like they let them recover and then they would do it again It was a shorter time and then eventually they just stopped the studies and the monkeys like never technically recovered But that's not I'm going to say that's not indicative of like normal cell phone exposure But that's way more Yeah But you should be pretty concerned like in any capacity that that exists And then there was some more studies They ran some blood work and they didn't really tell people And eventually you know people figured it out and like broke the news and it was it was a big deal but it was so inconclusive that no standards nothing was was really changed at all Right And then there was also the Philadelphia experiments that were done in the US where they were sending shooting like frequency beams at some of the sailors that were on the ship some of the Navy guys Yeah I'm not as familiar with that one but there there's a lot a lot of crazy The Cold War dude was like one of the craziest most sci-fi dystopian periods in America bro And that's where people are like "Oh there's all this like you know MK Ultra stuff." I'm like this was for war They were just trying to figure out and get the upper hand And yeah a lot of progress was made but a lot of the moon crazy stuff was was going on I I'll say that But what I wanted to say is there is no shortage of evidence that there's potential biological effect It's it's just the context No shortage of evidence there's biological effect I mean there is so many studies hundreds and hundreds of studies from that time period even more if you want to look at actually the Russian studies which are way more you know I I would say fair in terms of how they're measuring effects because what you're saying with like Havana syndrome Russia acknowledge I think it's called like aia or you what we call today hyper electroensitivity that there is a repercussion from overexposure long-term to electromagnetic fields and it's funny two of the pioneers of technology in the early 20th century Um Nicola Tesla and Maronei the radio guy Maronei at the end of his life had like five heart attacks in in 10 years and the dude was literally you know on radio transmission all day And Tesla was always playing around with stuff and he literally went crazy in his later years died poor And if you look at it from you know an unbiased perspective you would say that for sure both of them had electro-hypersensitivity or some sort of electromagnetic related condition because they were just their nervous systems and bodies were fried Wow What is this uh this phone gate thing this that you emailed me about in France there's some sort of thing going on with phones being labeled Yeah there there's that There's a lot I would say the phone gate is they they basically tested all these phones and the manufacturing radiation emissions the S uh readings were were not accurate They were higher than they should have been like 90% of the phones Um so it was just a blatant lie from from the tech industry And that what phone specifically do we know i think it was almost all major smartphones Um but the problem is there even that whole metric specific absorption rate how they go about that what they're doing is they're measuring the energy the quote unquote energy being absorbed by your body from cell phone radiation Um and that I think came about in the 80s originally and then implemented more so in the late '9s as wireless technology emerged And it's purely based on calculations of like tissues And you know what they do the testing on they do the testing on a 6'2 220 lb bio adult biodummy So there's no real testing going on in terms of it being indicative of like a real human using the product So to me that whole metric and that system is flawed in every which way possible um that you can imagine And if you want to get even more like upset if you go into your settings of your phone you can literally go under like legal and regulatory guidelines RF exposure and there's a very cleverly crafted statement from every smartphone uh you know consumer electronics product device manufacturer that says like don't hold this product on your body like use 5 mm of separation to reduce RF exposure Um go into settings Okay let's see Let's do it right now And just legal Legal Okay L E G Legal and regulatory Yeah And then go to RF exposure RF exposure Okay And you can read like to reduce exposure to RF energy use a hands-free option such as speaker phone headphones Um and there's a you know much longer Okay Yeah The last paragraph To reduce exposure to RF energy use a hands-free option such as the built-in speaker phone headphones or other similar accessories Cases with metal parts may change the RF performance of the device including its compliance with the RF exposure guidelines in a manner that has not been tested or certified Wow Although this device has been tested to determine radio frequency exposure uh compliance in each band of operation not all bands are available in your area Bands are dep dependent on your service providers wireless roaming networks That's another thing I wanted to ask you about Um what about the like the AirPod headphones those wireless Bluetooth headphones that everyone use Are those super toxic they're 2.4 GHz as well So it's the same frequency as your Wi-Fi Um just below a microwave oven I I I saw a clip on Huberman's podcast where he's interviewing I think it's a brain a neurosurgeon Yeah the Neurolink guy right is that who that was no no no It wasn't the guy who had Neurolink or No it wasn't the guy who had the brain chip This guy was like an actual neurosurgeon and he was asking him about radio frequencies and he asked the guy like what he thought about the those headphones those Apple headphones Like oh it's not a big deal He's like they put out such a little bit it wouldn't make a difference That's true But guess where they're located in your head on in your ear canal Zero distance Not not even zero distance It's almost like even closer than your phone would be right cuz it's in your ear So it's very true that Bluetooth is low energy low power you know that's the whole uh glamour to Bluetooth It's like low power It's amazing uh in electrical engineering like everyone loves Bluetooth even though it's it's kind of like for connectivity and stuff it's it's kind of a pain in the ass right like things are always connecting disconnecting Apple Apple has you know made it seamless because they have the hardware and the accessory every other Bluetooth accessory doesn't get Apple's um kind of protocols that's why they're a lot more annoying to connect by the way um so yeah but if you if you measure you know the EMF meter like we use today on on AirPods at the distance they are exposed to to your head cuz they're zero distance Zero distance It's it's like the same as standing like a foot away from a microwave oven or actually worse So it's very much really I would be concerned I would say because of the duration and the distance It's all part of the equation here You have the distance you have the intensity of the field and then the duration of the exposure I've looked at a ton of studies A lot of the studies have harmful effects over out over over some duration of exposure being like chronic So again if it's just like 10 minutes or 20 minutes that's really not what we're talking about here We're talking about 247 365 We're in a Wi-Fi bath We never turn our phone off It's always on our body We have the AirPods in It's a layer on top of a layer on top of a layer of an EMF toxic cake And that's my issue with it I could make the debate that says if you wear AirPods to take a phone call and your phone is on the other side of the room that would actually maybe be better because the phone is typically the highest source of RF versus having it up to your head like that Yeah that that is the worst The phone up to your ear is by far the highest amount of RF radiation exposure Um wired headphones would be better Um you could even say that wired headphones have some conductive material They have a neodyinium magnet that has a DC static magnetic field in in them as well which is not ideal So they're So they're a little bit better but not much They're better Um Air Tube headphones exist but they have like the most atrocious user experience They're horrible The ones you get on airplanes right yeah Yeah They're horrible So that's Look it's it's imperfect everywhere If you I think are more diligent about how you use your phone don't keep it on your body when it's on especially next to reproductive organs or next to your head um and you want to use AirPods for a couple hours a day like be my guest All I'm saying is this all adds up And we're never giving our body a break But what we did at your house today was what we optimize your sleep environment So that's when you actually have a chance to recover to repair your cells to get into autophagy to get into apoptosis clean up the you know damaged cells And that is what we're not getting because of the blue light at night because of the disruptive circadian rhythms and because we have all these stressors like Wi-Fi our cell phone you know high amount of electrical power EMFs in our bedroom all the damn time What have you noticed as far as like a change have you can you like actually feel a change in your the way you feel during the day after getting rid of all this [ __ ] where you sleep the opposite I feel it when I'm back in an environment that is high MF So really oh yeah It's like with everything toxic you typically don't feel an amazing response when you cut something out but when you add it back in your body's like "Whoa." Yeah So right So like it becomes normal right you're just used to that feeling better And then when you get back into the shitty environment you're like "Oh shit." And then conversely when you go back to the good environment after being in a in a bad one you notice it Yeah So for example I live in central Wyoming in a 2,000 person town So very chill low EMF low stress there's no traffic there's barely any people My house is hardwired I turn the power off at night It's great I sleep amazing And then our office for Daylight's in San Francisco And I go there I was there for two weeks last month And yeah you just feel it like you're more on edge Um you're just hyperactive sympathetic dominant nervous system Uh you don't sleep as well you're kind of just you know a little fidgety You you're just stressed out and that's what you feel this anxious energy and it's probably a combination of a lot of stuff And then I go back to Wyoming for the first time like 2 weeks later and I walk around the block and I was like I just took a deep breath and I was like "Okay wow." Like I actually feel like I can relax And that's what this is It's this background stressors that are really just keeping us on edge and that's so draining to our biology It's so fatiguing for our cells to never actually fully be in a parasympathetic state and execute biological functions We're always in fight or flight and over time that results in you know uh a bad outcomes uh at a cellular level And it's it's a mitochondrial toxin is what most of these studies there's thousands of studies almost all of them point to oxidative stress mitochondrial damage And you see it because it proliferates in the most energetically rich dense mitochondrial dense tissues which is your heart your brain and your reproductive organs And that's where a lot of these studies and issues are That's another thing that I was reading um was that there was a study that was based on these EMFs and heart cancer in I think it was mice or something and that was they were exposed to um just were they exposed to like 5G or was it 4G or do you know what that one was yeah it was the national toxicology program Um they ran a multi-year study spent $25 million to you there's been a lot of studies where people spent a lot of money on this and this is a government agency coming from the you know department of human health and services and they looked at it was two 2G and 3G uh frequencies and and modulated signals which is again we can talk about what 5G actually is but we still use a lot of those same signals so it's very much indicative of the cell phone exposure I I think it was for a normal amount of time per day like 10 12 And there was clear evidence of tumors in the hearts of male rats There was some evidence of tumors in the brains and another area of the body And that was the conclusion And then guess what happened nothing They just like cut the funding and no follow-up studies There's so many you know conflicting media articles published on that And that's just one that's happened so many times People are always like "The studies are inconclusive." But guess what's happened over the last 20 to 30 years the telecom industry has funded so many shoddy studies So Oh yeah Oh yeah So many This is I think the worst industry where this occurs And there's people like Dr Henry Lie who from University of Washington put together like these comprehensive reviews like he literally has a Google drive of thousands of studies where he's tried to filter out and one of the first reviews he put together he did like 350 studies and he found I think it was like 55 to 60% showed harmful biological effects It was like kind of almost 50/50 But then when he subdivided them into who was funded independently and who was funded by industry it was like 70% of the independent studies showed harmful biological effects and like 25 to 30% funded by industry showed harmful biological effects And then more and more people did the same thing and they found the same conclusions UC Berkeley in 2010 did a review of all the industry funded studies and were like these are inadequate These are studies that are not even using real cell phones for their studies They're using simulated frequencies Uh so it's it's insane and geared to get better results Right Of course because what what is the worst outcome for the telecom industry and we're talking you know the OG ones like Motorola and now Verizon AT&T and of course the big tech you know device companies but really the telecom giants uh this could really hamper and it's happened since the 90s uh that Dr Henry lie guy in 2006 found that radio frequency cell phone exposure causes DNA strand breaks and then Motorola went on this smear campaign was like no no no that's what was the name of this it was called what again Dr Henry lie L A R Henry lie And then how would we find that on on uh the internet just type in DNA strands Yeah DNA strand bake or EMF exposure Okay Um summary And the the reason why you've never heard this or no one's talking about this is so many of these researchers basically got cancelled So every everyone like Alan Frey funding pulled Um there was Milton Zarit before him in the 60s was proving that EMFs cause cataracts That was like the first known cataract Cataracts was the first known side effect of EMFs besides thermal increasing the temperature of your body And then it was actually testicular damage in the '60s as well which they covered up They both got cancelled [[Robert O Becker|Robert O Becker]] Andrew Marino they went on 60 minutes or [[Robert O Becker|Robert O Becker]] did they got cancelled Henry lie Henry Li's research has shown that exposure to a 60 Hz magnetic field at intensities of 0.1 to 0.5 millla millesla for 2 hours can cause inc an increase in DNA single and double strand breaks in brain cells of rats So okay what would an what would a 60 Hz magnetic field in the 0.1 to.5 mill Tesla range be equivalent to in the real world so that's 60 Hz is power frequency So that's what's coming out of your outlet That's um so what's that like 100 millig that's probably being 6 to 12 in away from your power outlet Like pretty close Um maybe even close So like where I'm sleeping in my bedroom Yeah you'd have to be really close to it or live very close to like high voltage transmission line The more damning one for me is one that even goes further back is actually that there's a statistically significant increased risk of childhood leukemia at four milligals So that's you know like 100 times lower What is a milligal uh a milligal is just another measure of um power flux density which is magnetic field So if I converted that um so they found out that childhood leukemia rates were how did they do that how do they measure this it it was epidemiological research like correlative data but it was reproduced So it's actually a crazy story what happened because there was and it and it comes back to to Robert Obecker as well So basically the Navy was trying to build this antenna in in Michigan and then Wisconsin um for submarine communication and that was called project sanguin Uh eventually like they renamed it four times because the public kept freaking out about it because the Navy asked Robert Obecker and a few other scientists to review the current research on low frequency EMFs and their biological impact And they looked at that time in the 70s at the existing research and they concluded that there were potential harmful effects mostly from you know power line data and yeah there's some some correlative stuff Sorry I'm distracted And they they recommended that the Navy you know not proceed forward or you know proceed with caution because there was existing evidence that showed low frequency EMFs could be harmful to biology Although the Navy's antenna they wanted to build was like thousands of times lower intensity than all the power lines and exposure to power lines And then the Navy kind of covered that up They didn't tell anybody Uh and then they just were like "Yeah this is safe." And then [[Robert O Becker|Robert O Becker]] went on 60 Minutes and like made this big public outcry about it And you know then the public kind of was freaked out So they boycotted it got moved to Wisconsin etc And then Robert Obecker went back to his home state of New York and started you know petitioning against this new power line project that was going to be built uh because he thought it would be unsafe based on the distance that they were putting into it And he started doing his own studies on rats and they found some you know multi-generational issues with birth rates and and health concerns in rats Uh and then someone from North Carolina I think her name was Nancy Worerheimer something came out and it said four milligals is like a threshold for statistically significant increased risk of childhood leukemia um because of proximity transmission lines Then the New York State Power Lines project were like we're going to fund a study It's going to be like $20 million to disprove it They had this whole thing and then guess what they came up with the same result They actually and they actually admitted it They admitted it and then you know what they said they said "Well it's too late Uh we're going to set the safety threshold to 100 milligals because the public has already taken this safety concern You know that's their problem." And they then nothing happened Jesus Christ That was in the the late '7s Yeah I think I had it in my notes somewhere here of everything that happened Yeah NY's study at only three milligs was in 1979 The utility funded study was in 1987 which confirmed her results and then they were like yeah sorry um the public has accepted this risk And then there was guys in the '9s um this guy RP Liberty that showed more studies for 60 Hz fields proliferating uh cancer cells suppressing melatonin And then the the New York Times like said that this guy made up his results even though he like grafted one table like slightly incorrect The results were were totally fine So a lot of the every decade there has been a massive EMF debate and nobody knows about this Most of the literature I'm reading I wish I could have sent you more stuff It's all from the ' 60s7s 80s 90s and then so you just have to apply that today Well because first off the power transmission exposure is exactly the same Nothing has changed Like we still have 60 Hz We have the same exact power lines We have the same exact power Um same But guess what we have So now we have 5G towers everywhere Yeah But we also have way more stuff like just plugged in and powered And then on top of that we have wireless technology We have the [ __ ] we we have the AirPods in our ears and the Meta VR glasses on I have I have a buddy who like he walks around all day with his he's got a prescription meta glasses and he films everything in fisheye like connects to his phone Like dude it's insane And I wonder what those those um Elon Musk brain chips are doing to people Well I mean not many people have them but like so say you were one of the medical people that got paralyzed and how to get that chip installed I wonder how bad that thing would be because it's like in your brain inside the gray matter We just don't know And you know from reading Robert Obecker's work we know that the human body is operating at very very low intensity like currents and fields So any of this exposure even this lowle exposure and a lot of this research actually it's not it's not linear it's not dose dependent like higher is always worse actually for magnetic fields and what really blew everyone's mind in my mind like 3 to four millig is is nothing that's like if I'm sitting in the front passenger seat of my 4Runner I'm getting like 2 to 4 millig from the alternator like that's that's what I was going I was going to ask you that too I was going to say do you have some super old car with like not a lot of electronics in there If you want the lowest EMF car you should buy like a 1999 Camry or something you know four-cylinder What's the best truck that's low EMF do you think i mean something that's older would have less electronics in it but the older the better The alternator is actually going to generate magnetic fields And again it's it I wouldn't worry about your car I would worry about like your phone that's next to you in your lap if you're driving for a while more so right i mean there's little you can do about you're not going to go shield your alternator They probably could figure out a way to do that but um that's you know I'm not a fan of Teslas of course because they have a tremendous amount of magnetic field exposure plus screens everywhere plus the semiconductor content is through the roof Well the batteries have to be converted to run an AC induction motor And whenever you're converting power like the alternator like the inverter traction inverters that are used to convert the DC battery to run the AC induction motor Yeah Tremendous amount of EMX EMF exposure Even solar inverters like you know if you're running an off-grid homestead and you're converting DC to AC you want to be cognizant of of your inverter because that's going to be high power Converting um electricity is is high EMFs Have you ever run your equipment inside of a Tesla no I've never driven in a Tesla when I had my EMF meter but people have sent me videos I want to It would be cool but it's really hard because like you saw in your house measuring radio frequencies is a bit challenging I'm like is your Bluetooth off is that off like the baseline is very high So you you need to make sure everything is clean And I'm not going to lie I've seen videos online of people like measuring Teslas And I'm like I'm 90% sure their phone is on when they're recording the video So they're recording it with their phone right so unless that's on airplane mode people and you've removed every other variable you are not measuring something accurately from a radio frequency perspective And then who knows how close like the the next cell tower is if you're in a public space Yeah But yeah so you said 5G right it's just everything is additive We're subtracting nothing and then everything else around us is getting worse But there's so much correlative data There's you know tons of studies actually getting into the nitty-gritty with like rodents Um there was a interphone study So people don't realize that the ARC which is not some like end- all beall organization like magnetic fields and radio frequencies international agency of research on cancer okay they are both classified as possible carcinogens And when they started first looking into radio frequencies in the late 80s I think it was the EPA or one of these organizations they did like a preliminary investigation and they recommended that it be classified as a as a probable carcinogen and then the White House did some like side quest and came up with some data and they were like "No don't don't do that." So um there's been a lot of back and forth but the the study that the ARC did called the Interphone study uh was from like 2000 to 2004 They spent millions of dollars to look at cell phone users and brain cancer And this was 2000 to 2004 Not a lot of people were using cell phones So there was mixed results But for heavy users which was up to 30 minutes a day heavy user had statistically in uh increased risk of brain cancer Wow So that's what I'm saying It's like you you kind of have to make extrapolations from the data that exists whether it be from the 70s microwaves using the same frequencies from phone studies from 20 years ago because guess who's not studying anything indicative of our actual EMF exposure today no one because no one's going to fund the study All the researchers who have got cancelled and definitely the industry is not going to publish something that could be potentially harmful So 5G literally got rolled out with no studies like nothing So 5G is interesting 5G is like one of the top conspiracy theories out there All the craziest deepest tinfoil hat people are like 5G uh Maderna vaccine turns on the nanobots Um but one of the cra like when I think I don't know if you've ever seen the show Westworld on HBO Do you see the latest it's one of the like few TV shows I've ever watched It's one of my favorite shows of all time uh the last season of it they have these towers all around the city that like blast out this signal that frees all the robots so they can go in and make repairs and they can go in and make alternations to their simulation that they're in And I like driving around this town now and I see 5G towers on every [ __ ] street corner It it reminds me of that dude like it like it they look similar and it's like it's hard to avoid thinking about those just crazy cuckoo conspiracy theories when science fiction shows are literally like utilizing the same sort of form of a thing Um but like so so when it comes to 5G correct me if I'm wrong but in your Substack article you basically explained that it's it's way of way higher frequency and far more dangerous but it's more localized It's less like of a widespread thing that blankets you Yeah So 5G is complicated because it actually operates in three different frequency bands So it still uses the low frequency similar uh bands as 3G and 4G It's called like the low band um like 800 900 MHz to 2 GHz Then there's the sub6 GHz band which is kind of in between 2 and a half GHz to 6 GHz uh which is als which is new also new but kind of the in between And then there's the millimeter waves which everyone was really concerned about because millimeter waves are like 30 40 maybe even up to 50 gigahertz So we're talking about like a 10x increase in frequency Millimeter waves and that's referring to the wavelength So frequency and wavelength are inversely related Okay so the higher frequency you go you get a higher energy of the wavelength and then you get a shorter uh sorry you get higher energy of the wave and then you get a shorter wavelength Okay so that's just like when you get to 30 40 GHz it's in the millimeter wave territory as opposed to the centimeter wave territory Got it so it's just yeah different characteristics of EM waves and that's a big jump It's like 10x increase all of a sudden we've never done this They're higher energy so potentially higher energy is is a is a concern And that's fair but the problem is uh as you alluded to it's more local It's really um more challenging because the range on the millimeter waves is terrible They can only go like a few hundred yards before they get eaten up by you know the water vapor in the air And they get blocked by trees is they get blocked by buildings because of the characteristics of the wave at that frequency So that's why they have to build these repeater towers everywhere else this what's a repeater Oh those are the towers 5G towers Yeah the 5G towers you know how like before you would have like one massive tower it's like over town over there That's working like almost omnidirectionally where it's just spewing out like 3G 4G signals in all angles just like your Wi-Fi router is 5G is different because they went to this higher frequency The only way to really like get anywhere they have to have a narrow beam width Um which when it's more narrow it's more concentrated So it's actually higher power and then they have to have repeater towers So these smaller towers these smaller cell stations um all over So that's why you see them on light post on buildings on like disguises trees like literally everywhere And they have these different look Look there's a palm tree one Yeah They they try and like disguise it right and and they have these different looks because they have way more antennas on them because they're using a different frequency Feel more in tune with nature when it looks like a palm tree an electronic palm tree blasting you with cancer And that's that's bad potentially because it's higher power It's more concentrated But they really only rolled out millimeter waves where it makes sense cuz it's a massive infrastructure problem and it makes no sense to have like that in the suburbs or in rural places for sure Can you tell by looking at one of these towers if it's 5G or 4G or something else are there differences or are they mostly all 5Gs um well they're mostly now the newer ones with those like big white rectangular blocks are are definitely all 5G Can I show you the one out back real quick and you can see what Tell me what you think Sure Let's take a quick break All right We just looked at the 5G tower out back and we put up your meter next to it and it looks like it's pretty hot It is hot It is not millimeter waves Changed your hat We got We got a hat change in the podcast Hat changed went from the Wyoming based organic cotton to Make America Healthy Again Good We got to cover all the bases Yeah Um not millimeter waves because you're not in a urban downtown area So the good thing about 5G millimeter waves which everyone was the most freaked out about is because they're so range dependent and very you know get eaten up very quickly Uh they're only ever going to be probably in downtown areas entertainment centers um airports big venues Vegas strip on top of the hotel for sure For sure Um where data throughput and you know bandwidth matters tremendously Like if you're in a stadium with 100,000 people they're going to need insane throughput and it doesn't have to go that far So that's where they'll they have them on now all the stadiums you know the top of the stadium railings have like 5G repeater towers or um cells So that's a good thing about 5G Well then how come when you're in one of those stadiums you never have phone service well that's what they're trying to fix So I haven't been in a pro sports stadium in a long time so I can't tell you if it's gotten any better But um also the data throughput now the amount of garbage we're posting on social media and downloading all the time is just always increasing So it's like they're always just trying to catch up And that's what people need to understand that 5G is just fifth generation wireless technology It doesn't mean gigahertz It does not mean gigahertz It just so happens that 5 gigahertz is in the range of like where 5G mid-band is is used So it's very confusing and they you know it's very confusing for the layman because even for me diving into this there's not a lot of information out there and there's a lot of people reporting on 5G in 2020 2021 and not a lot of updates since but I can tell you millimeter waves have actively been rolled out every major city in the US for sure downtown areas entertainment centers uh airports especially and they're probably never going to be rolled out in suburbia maybe in rural areas for sure not So that's where the midband like 3 to 6 gigahertz you get the sweet spot of slightly higher frequency slightly higher data throughput but you're not you know dropping out every 100 yards So I don't know for sure this measures my EMF uh meter measures 200 MHz to 8 GHz So that could be mid-band that could be low band but for sure we went out there we measured it We stood like 20 ft away from it It's hot But But what did you realize you're like "Oh that's not even as bad as my bedroom." Right My bedroom is worse than that Next to my baby monitor That baby monitor dude was like was like sitting next to a to Chernobyl or something Not quite but it was four It was like 400,000 on that It It was about 10 times higher than standing 20 ft away from the cell tower So that's what I like to tell you people Distance is everything And I would It was 10x next to a baby monitor than it was sitting next to a 5G cell phone tower Yes that's correct That is insane But also our phones were off out there If you like connected your phone and then it was pinging the tower again your phone is the biggest source The whatever is closest to you is going to be the biggest source Like that baby monitor was so close to where you're sleeping So that's that's the problem And that's good Why you can't move a cell tower You can change how you use your technology and how you interact with it And it is really criminal I would say And something I learned and talked about on on the Maha podcast was the legislation side of things a bit more And the Telecommunications Act of 1996 it actually took away the ability for state and local government to have any say in where wireless infrastructure gets placed is purely a federal decision and if they give the green light to the industry they can put towers wherever they want And that's why you saw the 5G roll out All of a sudden there was towers being built everywhere Nobody could do anything about it And to me so he leases the guy who owns this he leases that land to them for that tower Yeah And and it depends maybe on on certain agreements but for the most part there's pretty much no say And that was the the most lobbyed bill of like the time here the the wireless industry lobbyed like $50 million and that was back you know 30 years ago and nothing has really changed That's also coincidentally the last year that wireless technology safety thresholds and guidelines were updated Um and that's what [[Robert F Kennedy Jr|RFK]] and the Children's Health Defense successfully sued the FCC for being negligent in safety standards and guidelines because they haven't been updated in you know over 25 years When did he do this 2021 They won the lawsuit You you could look that up see more details Children's Health Defense su FCC and [[Robert F Kennedy Jr|RFK Jr]] was a was a presiding attorney there and they won but nothing's happened So I'm I'm really excited to you know I was talking to the Maja team like is he actually you know you think he's actually going to do some stuff on EMFs because guess what there's a lot of issues out there This one's probably the hardest one to to tackle from just how sticky the infrastructure situation is Oh it's 2022 Um you got to type in 2022 at the top Steve Oh no It's good You got it That was the right one That was it Okay Oh no it was 2021 The article edition Okay Okay Okay so this is the article Scroll down And they made the case for for children um challenging the FCC's wireless radiation guidelines On August 31st 2021 the US Court of Appeals of the DC Circuit published decisions on the historic case [Music] um Health Defense in its landmark case against the Federal Communications Commission's challenging the FCC's decision to not review its health and safety guidelines regarding 5G and wireless technology The court's decision states that the FCC failed to provide a reason a reasoned explanation for its determination that its current guidelines adequ adequately protect against harmful effects of exposure to radio frequency radiation and failed to review the extensive evidence um the extensive evidence scientific evidence and evidence of existing sicknesses that was filed with the FCC So nothing's changed So so they won the case but there's been no sort of extra regulations put on these people or maybe they just got a shitload more money from him I Nothing's happened and that's why I'm really excited to see has he talked about has RFK talked about any of this stuff like in the last 6 months he has a little bit but not not a ton And I don't think it's the place to start to be honest Like this stuff is hard What What is he going to do you can't just like snap your fingers and all of a sudden red 40 die is gone You know that doesn't exist with with radio frequencies Well the crazy thing about him is like all before he got confirmed by the Senate there was all these senators coming out saying like if he starts saying crazy stuff we're not voting for his ass Yeah He's playing the game So Oh yeah You have to play the game You have to play the game That's the unfortunate part of the whole of the whole thing because it's so I mean it's got to be so I mean who's to say he's not corruptible we don't know that He's never been in this position before but just spending time with his team they told me they're like they he is fired up about EMFs and the Children's Health Defense like they're two big topics Like EMFs is is one of them The vaccines are the other one And you know I'm stoked to see if there's anything that's going to come of of the EMF situation because it's so hard What are they going to do these towers already exist We're operating on this wireless infrastructure It's not like they can just switch to something different They could change the safety thresholds and guidelines You know Russia other Eastern European countries they do have more stringent standards and they do have even more stringent standards for like schools and hospitals etc Um but I don't think that would make like a meaningful change What I would really like to see is better science better research Let's fund some studies from the HHS or the NIH that's simulating what the actual exposure is Okay we have a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi Uh Danny just made a call on 900 meghertz and there's another like 6 GHz band over there That's a real life exposure And there's all these different input signals There's been there's never been a study done like that And all the industry funded studies are an absolute joke And then the ones that people have skated by on really old are not exactly applied to how technology is working today So I think that's probably the biggest impact that that he can make in in the short term And you know at daylight I'm going to try and reinvent wireless technology I'm just going to think of something and hopefully we can try it out Maybe get some research grants to to look into like what if we use infrared uh range for wireless data communication That's an option Some LiFi actually is a thing So people are yeah it's it's using uh infrared terraertz uh wavelengths to data use data communication but I'm skeptical that that even that would be nonharmful to humans The idea is so radio frequencies Danny if I go if I go to the mountains where I hunt do you know what this says it says zero zero nothing nothing this 200 MHz 8 gigahertz is completely alien it doesn't exist um light fidelity whoa that's light fidelity wireless communication technology that uses light to transmit data over visible light ultraviolet and infrared spectrums Wow So potentially uh uh transmitter is available from Hypersian Hyperion text tech which features a 940 NM 1W LED and supports a wide bandwidth 100 uh KHZ to 25 MHz Okay whatever the [ __ ] that means That's one watt one watt infrared 940 nm It's basically an infrared LED and they're using it to transmit data which is cool because the idea is we are used to infrared light like that's that's something the body has taken as an input signal for a long time So it is it would be less harmful potentially than radio frequency which is completely alien However I'm not 100% certain that that would still be the the case because a lot of the research from the 70s from Alan Frey from folks like Dr Martin Pal who has looked into like voltage gated ion channel activation from EMFs they all say the same thing that it's not just about the frequency it's about the modulation so a frequency is one component but in order to get the data through you have to modulate the wave to carry the data um to be received by um you know the the receiving trans transceiver and that is very pulseed It's it's very unnatural like sunlight and electromagnetic waves in nature are just like continuous waves Uh they don't have modulation techniques applied to them So you still are going to have to modulate an infrared wave because you need to there needs to be data on the wave or else like that's the whole point of wireless technology So I'm curious I would love to test it I would love to see research on alternative solutions like that And that's kind of what's what's exciting But there's it's multiaceted It's very complicated We started talking about light Dude light's pretty easy I'm not going to lie We just need to copy the sun Um the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum is is is far more complex And I we haven't even talked about like the Earth's natural magnetic field and resonance and you know fields interacting with each other having a biological effect There's there's a lot going on Yeah Um so when it comes to the daylight computer h how did you guys get how did you and get hooked up about it and and then and then um what specifically are are you working on in regards to the technology and and everything you guys are doing at the company yeah So I had an onen on my podcast last January Um my old podcast where I talked about a year ago January Yeah Oh wow Over a year ago Um decentralized radio I always caught a lot of had a lot of these researchers that you know I I read their papers and I just wanted to ask them questions about kind of this electromagnetic health stuff and yeah halfway through the podcast I was kind of in between I left my engineering job like 3 4 months earlier I worked in the semiconductor industry for 5 years and uh I'm an electrical engineer but I went right into the more of the business side of product marketing management um of of the industry and then was building my you know health brand and podcasting and writing ing and coaching a bit was like ah I don't really know that's not what I'm meant to do I have this kind of very specific skill set and then I met onen I was like oh this is this is the most important company in the world to succeed cuz there there is no alternative no one's building healthier tech and I knew it was possible like I knew about all this stuff was engineering changes that needed to happen but you're competing with the biggest companies in the world so the barrier to entry is so high's like yeah we're releasing a product to the market in like 6 months or 5 months But you guys are going the opposite direction Those other you're not competing with them You're you're almost in a completely separate world But I know how working in the chip industry I knew how hard it is to get started because nobody cares about you when you're low volume Nobody cares about you Everyone's doing hundreds of thousands millions and millions of units So when you're a small guy it's so hard to get started So I knew it from that perspective as well And then yeah I jumped on board I was like I'm working for you full-time I started like Well I started just like health marketing stuff He didn't even know like what exactly I did in the past but I slowly just took on more and more And now I'm head of operations and marketing So I'm kind of like yeah running the company with Hunin And dude it's such an exciting product I don't think I've ever been so excited about a tech product in my life Like other when the other than when the the iPhone first came out cuz I remember when the first iPhone came out I think it was like 20 2008 2009 something like that And like my buddy had one and it was just like "Holy [ __ ] how does this [ __ ] exist?" This thing you just touch it you swipe it it makes these little sounds and it makes the ch the screen changes and it does things just with touch It was like it was there's not been anything since the first iPhone came out that groundbreaking tech technologically consumer-wise in my experience But like this it's the same It's a touch screen but like it is the goal of it is to reduce all the negative effects of technology which there's nothing else like that that I've ever seen which is why it's so [ __ ] cool because you can do things like read a book browse the internet listen to podcasts sketch on it all this crazy stuff And it is optimized to work outside which is I love it because I'm I've literally been outside spending more time outside during the day reading which is great It makes me get my ass out there And like you know everything about it is just is just amazing I literally like I just told you before we started this podcast I I take notes on this during every podcast now which is like and it's cool cuz you can save it all and you're not dealing with this thing that's connected to this whole like Apple walled garden where all these notifications are connected to everything My phone my computer my laptop like it's just disconnected decentralized which is why it's so [ __ ] sick And um you know I don't know I think that uh that there's got to be I mean a like I understand it's going to be really [ __ ] hard for you guys and I'm sure you could probably elaborate on that a little bit but um that vision that you guys have and like that the why behind your company is is completely genuine and completely unique Yeah And it's cool because people are ready for it and you know just talking to you know like the the Maha stuff is like is this real like is this I've been doing this stuff for like six seven years now and there's people who've been talking about this stuff for decades and you know I met some friends in Austin that have been living kind of this life for 15 years and it's like this is actually finally happening you know we we have so much momentum people are becoming aware of these problems it's kind of the benefit of of the internet and of social media to some degree and podcasts like yourself like the new age of media actually being able to elaborate on these topics like people can listen to this podcast and be like yeah this I he's pretty fired up about health and EMF So it's it's not there's nothing to fake here Like same with Unen right you can get on a podcast It's so genuine Our our marketing is just it's real And that's the company mission is let's return to what's actually real Like get outside Let's have real conversations real relationships not being sucked into the Apple ecosystem or the Google ecosystem And especially for children which we're most passionate about they are just being set up for failure on every level because we're handing them devices at such a young age And not only is there direct impact from the light the EMFs it's keeping them indoors and then that's the reality they grow up in and they're just missing out on all of that experience And who is surprised when there's all these mental health issues and physical health issues that that stem from that so for us we're just so grateful and there is no one else you know doing this There's no one who's ever made a consumer electronics hardware product that's like I'm going to market this to be healthier So we think it's a massive opportunity We're super excited We're super focused on on building better solutions And I'm actively talking about things we're looking into Like I hope someone else talks or looks into LiFi and we want to add infrared LEDs to our backlight and maybe do a few other things and we're investigating but if you have ideas or you have experience like hit us up We we want to collaborate with people because we're still a really small team and it's going to take some time to to keep improving on this But even the first gen product I you know I use it for everything almost and uh at least every day for four to five hours taking notes and messaging and that's like you can send messages on it Yeah Like WhatsApp Slack Um Oh really telegram Yeah Yeah I should have known that you can you can do that when you connect a keyboard It definitely unlocks more of the the full computer functionality but yeah it's great I mean I can't work on things that I'm not like super passionate about So I'm just so grateful that I have this opportunity where everything I've done the past decade basically can be channeled into making daylight a success And if daylight's a success then people have the optionality to make better choices in terms of technology that isn't harmful for their health M Anren was explaining how this screen technology you could like only find it in Japan Yeah Yeah That's where he pioneered it He innovated with some researchers and we're manufacturing it So the display is the innovation Yeah Cuz it's like cuz it's like a Kindle on steroids but it's not because you can zoom in and out It's super quick But it looks like that ink What is the ink electronic ink is what looks like electronic ink all the e-readers use So this is the only device that has that that special Japanese techn screen technology that utilizes that Yeah it it's out it's onen came up with that with the researchers and then they're imple implementing it from a manufacturing perspective So it's the only you know 60 plus frames per second refresh rate e-aper product tablet What does uh have you guys talked to anybody i asked Anin this but from your perspective like how much time have you spent in like Silicon Valley around other people that are working for other tech companies and have you seen like what their reactions are to this stuff or this topic in general yeah Um most of our investors and a lot of our early supporters are from Silicon Valley I I would say And there are people I think that are seeing what's coming uh they and they've seen what they've created and worked on and how it's really not bringing out the best in people anymore and they themselves I think we're at a point now where if you ask the average person they're like yeah social media and my phone I don't really have the best relationship with with that it's I'm kind of addicted and it's true everyone l myself included probably you like we get in we doom scroll like it's designed that way it's so hard to not be sucked in and then those people a lot of them you know they either have money uh disposable income because they did make some wealth from whatever SAS startup or other company they they had and they want to support something that seems a bit more meaningful And yeah I would say a lot of our early supporters they're they're big deep work people So productivity reading writing and I would say overall from the individual perspective the reception in Silicon Valley has been pretty great I mean I don't hang out there a lot I live in Wyoming So uh but from what I've you know experienced and gathered it's it's been really positive I think it's it's been positive in so many ways And we just went to South by Southwest and we won like an innovation Oh in Austin Yeah In Austin We won an innovation award and bunch of people especially parents were coming up to us like "This is so amazing Like I've been looking for something like this like you know can't wait to get this for my daughter because I just like don't want to give her an iPad but I it's helpful to have something And you could probably relate to that better than me but that's what's cool about this And and we haven't even spent a ton of effort on on marketing and we don't really have the bandwidth You guys have the sickest website I've ever seen in my life We we did we spent a lot of effort on the website and the launch videos I will say that But then after that we haven't um we've kind of been quiet If you can scroll through this website and not spend money on this iPad then this healthy iPad I call it a healthy iPad That's what that's what my kid calls it Acceptable It's acceptable Um if you can't if you can scroll through this website and not buy one you have enormous self-control Yeah Our team did such an incredible job on that Um it's it's it's brilliant And that's the thing We when we do things we want to do it you know on brand So it's it's not like jumping out and having all these you know colors um in your face and any type of content We're we're trying to be very true to our brand and and very authentic But that's why um you know discussions like this podcast is is so powerful because people can actually align with you know what we stand for and hear hear myself talk about these topics and that's that's what it's all about for me But we we've been building So we're really excited at you know what's to come in the next couple years And for us um this is just the beginning really So does this obviously it's very unique screen technology cuz there's no blue light and you guys have this sort of like incandescent color right this like full spectrum color to it Um but like what have you done or what do you guys uh plan on doing with like the frequencies like the cuz does this put off the same radiation as a iPhone yeah So the EMFs have not been optimized at all at the hardware level We technically have a weaker Wi-Fi chip because you're just like a startup with a worse Wi-Fi chip than like an iPad Yeah Um I've I've done like a headto-head of this versus my MacBook and it's actually like significantly lower for just that reason which is pretty funny We're coming out with smart airplane mode which is going to be a software update which takes very little effort Any company could do it where say right here this is connected to Wi-Fi but I haven't used it in like a minute it'll just go into airplane mode Oh cool And then instead of pinging the network every 8 to 10 seconds like right now like same with my phone like I manually put it in airplane mode like it's in airplane mode right now If you're not a psychopath like me who does that all the time you're never going to do that But if it was sitting next to you do you do you need it constantly connected and then maybe it just pings like when you have a custom setting every 5 minutes or on a daylight that's not what this is for So it can be an airplane mode much longer and we're thinking of what's the best way to do it But that's such an easy lift for us smart airplane mode and you know you won't have to remember to do that Then in the next generation products we are definitely looking into how we can optimize EMFs uh EM EMI radiation RF uh at the hardware level Mhm But I'm going to say this is it's pretty complex It's pretty tricky Like we're the going to be the first company that's ever tried to do this And we have some ideas like hey what if there's some sensors on the daylight computer to where it knows your position in space and then it's only outputting the radiation the Wi-Fi connectivity like away from you That would be cool and that actually wouldn't be too challenging to do A lot of the newer chipsets have directionality functionality Um so that should be possible like theoretically in my head So I'm going to explore that And you know Wi-Fi is all around the room so it's not it it's not going to make your connection or your throughput any worse So that's something there's shielding there's filtering potentially to look into But again if you're an electrical engineer listening to this and I'm not an RF engineer but anyone has any ideas hit me up Tristancomputer.com Or the LiFi thing like long term maybe that's it Maybe in like a couple generations we build a Wi-Fi router and we move our devices to that cuz cuz what I can tell you Danny no one's going to move to hardwired internet I do that in my house Um cuz um I I think for at home setups Yeah I think for at home setups it's actually not bad because hardwired Yeah If you if you set it up to where Sorry to wake up You want to try that it's like this ammonia salt stuff Just wakes you up This is what the kids are doing now Yeah I have to do it every once in a while Oh wow That was a light sniff No Wi-Fi necessary Let's go Um Yeah So if you connect it like if you set it up the way it's not super um inconvenient Yeah It's better You get better data throughput It's more security and then you have lower EMF exposure as So I think for like home office setups if you're building a new house or getting a new setup and just pay someone to do it if you have the means you can make it pretty convenient But if you're on the go like your phone no one's ever going to hardwire their phone Well that's like the crazy thing about like you know people talk about this internet of things with 5G smart homes smart homes and you know everything just being connected everywhere And you know it's scary dude It's I just had this dude in here a couple months ago who was talking about how his TV was spying on him and these people these like hackers were like messaging him trying to extort him because they were like recording recording [ __ ] he did off of his TV like not just audio but I think video too Is he like a prevalent guy like some random guy no just some random dude I for No he was working on a movie or something It was like an actor in a movie and uh I don't know it was it's crazy story but like you know how like looking at China for example with all of the security state that they live in and the cameras everywhere and I don't know how much 5G they use but I imagine especially living in the dense metropolitan areas in China just bringing your little meter out there would make it probably explode with all the connectivity that they have Yeah You know Yeah And and do you need that do you need like your washing machine to talk to your smart meter to talk to your you know Amazon accounts or really like really do we actually need that or is that just a byproduct of the fiat economy and selling us more stuff that we don't need and collecting data that is just going to sell more product to us so we're we're big privacy advocates too Like that's where the tinfoil hat really starts to shine is when you think about all the things that they're all these smart products and this internet of things and government control because like the most of this stuff is in China where they have complete to total control and surveillance over everybody with all this technology that they have So when you have your washing machine or your hair dryer that has a microphone built into it you know it's just like where does that road lead yeah you know and it might just be for collecting data so they can sell you more products But even if it's just that that's also even if it is just that right which it most likely is It's most likely not It doesn't even matter I don't want that I don't want that invasion of my privacy And I definitely don't want to be sold more products So to me regardless of where we stand on the reason for all this it's it's it's not okay And it and it can't you know change But we we didn't even talk about you know some of the the mind control or you said moving people around Something that is very factual is like the military does use radio frequencies for like active denial systems they're calling They use millimeter waves So active denial Yeah It's it's this 95 GHz like crowd control stuff That's a real thing It's been like 20 years and that is straight up just a very high power 95 GHz millimeter wave The videos of it are insane And they can crank it to where it feels like your skin is on fire It feels like your body because it has such an it'll heat your body up like 5 10° in a matter of seconds So that's where this is not a conspiracy theory that exists And there is definitely one Steve like like you were saying if they wanted to move people around like in Westworld I'm sure they they could do that If they actually wanted to do that they could do that And maybe that's like what warfare is is all about So give us some volume on this So these are volunteers This is a military area Move away from the perimeter Their new active denial system boasts a reach far beyond any other non-lethal system Well it's a versatile system Uh and it has a a range of uh non-lethal capability that we can't even come close to with any of our fielded systems goes very shallow uh into where your nerve receptors are Uh and there's no uh no permanent injury caused by it Uh very safe system We built in some safety margins and uh uh training for the operators They even let any of the guests volunteer to test out its effectiveness and safety including the assistant comedant of the Marine Corps sergeant major of the Marine Corps and assistant secretary of the Navy Most described it as feeling like a hot oven or grill being opened up It is something that once again probably the safest system that uh that developed as far as the non-lethal capability from Washington I'm Sergeant Andrew Milner The safest non-lethal They put non-lethal and safe in there a lot of times Yeah But then these people having seizures the next day They blasted it on someone and they moved them So that's that's moving crowd control right there So that's not a conspiracy theory And I think No they've been doing this stuff since the Cold War And I sent you I think a PDF I haven't even I need to read it again but there's literally directed energy weapon documents from the military that you can just look up It's not conspiracy theory This is warfare in 2025 It's going to be all drones It's going to be all DDWs lasers and EM waves Like and that's real if they wanted to use it on civilians I think the other case to be made is you know some of these research um studies from the past that show like rats becoming docile from you know electric field or magnetic field exposure and things like that There's like maybe a case to be made there but then guess what everyone is consuming the same environment So would they would they be doing that to themselves maybe they have some crystal that protects them They hire us I I don't know But yeah it to me it doesn't matter It's like we we we have a problem here and and we need to we need to think of what's a better uh solution for for wireless technology But So what was that thing you were telling me about that I could that you can install on your um your breaker panel to it's like a switch or something that you can use to turn off a certain room in your house Like at night time when you're going to bed just flip off flip off the power in your room Yeah So we said that turning your circuit breaker off in your bedroom would have a drastic effect on reducing your AC body voltage We turned the we turned the breaker off just for my bedroom and it reduced it by like a 100 thousand by like 10,000 times The Yeah Yeah It was um you don't want to turn your breaker on and off all the time Like mechanical switches like that were not meant to be like it's not a light switch It technically could be unsafe after a certain point So uh you would never recommend someone do that You probably could do it on a new breaker Um but the safe thing to do would be to get like a relay install and then uh there's companies that make solutions where they can hook it up to a remote control and then it just flips on and off So you could be like "Hey I want my bedroom the kids' bedroom uh to be on this to where I hit the button at 10 p.m The circuit breakers turn off and only the kitchen and the AC is powered on at night so that my uh electrical power and low frequency EMF exposure is far reduced So you can get that You can there's companies that make solutions like that And there's also like you could just ask your electrician to to probably do something like that if if you have a good electrician So that's something to consider Uh save power and don't bake your bra There we go And then you can use that electricity that you're not using to power your incandescent Incondescent bulbs Right There's a lot I mean I think there's a lot of studies out there And I would say the vast majority if not all of them like n 80 to 90% of them that aren't funded by industry show harmful biological effects And I would say this is kind of a very inconvenient truth for people So I don't want to be like fear-mongering You know you're going to die because of all this 5G and Wi-Fi It's just another stressor on top of this toxic cake We have the food we have the plastics we have the water we have the lights we have now the EMFs It is another thing And in my opinion the electromagnetic environment might be the most important if for if not the because it's what we're consuming 24/7 365 days a year And and the argument usually made against it is that nonionizing radiation isn't harmful And we already talked about studies of weak magnetic fields increasing risk of childhood leukemia We looked at other studies for you know cell phone exposure risk That's all nonionizing So I think that's without foundation And I think that's just something that people use because that's what they've been taught And it's like a blanket statement that is like "Oh there's no way." And it's invisible It's intangible So people really can't um understand the the the impact that it's having but it's it's a low-level stressor that's present in the environment It's disrupting your sleep It's disrupting your your cellular communication Like your mitochondria are really the the hub of communication and energy production And think of it right like think of it like me and you are in this room We're talking to each other We can hear each other very clearly It's great conversation Imagine if 50 people were in here You think we'd be able to hear each other as clearly imagine if there's a hundred people in here The signal to noise ratio because of this electromagnetic environment that's alien has never been lower There's all this noise going on and our body is using electromagnetic fields to communicate to drive cellular processes and when we have these non-native input signals that becomes distorted and then we get you know timing uh interruptions we get just there's trillions of cellular um reactions and and functions being executed like every second Yeah And to me that's how people should think about this is that there's so much noise going on And it's constantly keeping us in this sympathetic dominant um fight orflight state So you really never have that chance to be in the state you're meant to be and fully relax and and executing functions normally And at the lowest level our biology is electromagnetic You know that that's what people can't conceive And I'm like what are we using to measure all of these things in the hospital use an EEG to measure your brain an EKG Those are purely electrical Yeah MRI machines for torn ACLs cancers It's magnetic magnetic resonance imaging And there's just such a disconnect between medicine modern medicine academia and this world of electromagnetism because no one's really taught physics And then the physicists and engineers they don't know anything about biology So that's the only reason why people like talk to me is because I'm Yeah You're the only one that's making the making one of few people There's a lot of good folks out there but a lot of them have been you know suppressed had their funding stripped over the years and nothing has changed Like go and read a lot of these books Um The Invisible Rainbow is is an amazing one Robert or sorry uh rest in peace to Arthur Fenberg the guy who wrote that just died two weeks ago What was that one about um that was more high level and he correlated uh that the electrification of society directly correlated with the increase of of chronic disease Now that happened across the 20th century um mostly in the ' 40s and then you know 99% of society was electrified in in this by the 60s Chronic disease was there any like specification of like which disease was the most prevalent out of them heart disease I sent I sent you a picture of like the one graph he had I pull it up on my phone but it's basically again this is correlation not causation I can text it to Steve He could show it on the screen Yeah It's like rate of rural heart disease in in 1940 uh which was when a lot only the the cool states had electricity So okay This thing I should send Yeah Yeah All right Steve I'm gonna email this to you right now And basically Arthur Fersenberg just just talks about that and he talks about some crazy stuff that telecom cables when they were introduced in the late 1800s all of a sudden the flu went from being something that happened like every 5 to 8 years now happened every single year And it used to be more tracked to the flu used to only be a phenomenon apparently that occurred like uh every few years like really badly and it correlated with the solar cycle So there's an 11-year solar cycle and we're actually in a peak year right now So if you're wondering why a bunch of crazy stuff is happening you could say the solar cycle has somewhat of impact cuz there's a solar maximum and that means the most amount of sunspots are happening the most amount of geomagnetic storms which means the most amount of like magnetic variables and disturbances and that's been studied and looked at and having it's called a solar cycle Yeah 11 year and we're in a sol Can you look that up i need to read about this How have I not had anyone tell me about this july July 2025 is is the peak So July 2025 is the peak of the solar cycle Meaning there's more electricity There's you can read it Okay The solar cycle which is approximately 11 years long is the periodic change in the sun's activity measured by variations in the number of sunspots on the surface Okay Okay The cycle is driven by the sun's magnetic field which reverses direction every 11 years lending to fluctuations in solar radiation ejections from solar m of solar material and the occurrence of solar flares in and coronal loops The 11-year period is influenced by the differential rotation speed between the sun's poles and equator causing the magnetic field to stretch and eventually reverse So the the magnetic field of the sun reverses every 11 years Is that what this is saying yeah And that's having an impact on the magnetic environment on the earth And there's studies that look at you know psychiatric patients and overall like mental health of people uh that are very sensitive and and when there's increased solar activity and magnetic disturbances that can be felt Sometimes it's positive sometimes it's negative but there's there's more variation And this is all what I'm getting at here Keep scrolling down Steve Sorry keep going Is that we are electromagnetic beings The only reason there's life on this planet Danny is because we have a magnetic field that protects us from all of the ionizing a lot of the ionizing radiation from the sun And we have a magnetic field in the Earth because the Earth has a molten iron core which is moving charges And that moving charge is is creating a a powerful magnetic field that's protecting us And that magnetic field is driving our biology It actually influences our circadian rhythms And that's why potentially these weak magnetic fields from power lines and you know other products are are harmful Look at that NASA link because we are you know it's called electromagnetic interference in in electrical engineering When when we have interference or noise on the line that's disrupting the real input signal and the real input signal we need is the earth's magnetic field the Schuman's resonance which is a natural resonance phenomenon in the earth and the solar spectrum The sun has a magnetic pole flip every 11 years That'd be like north and the south poles swapping places every decade and the sun transitions from being calm to Holy [ __ ] dude If that happened on Earth we would not exist It would exactly it wipe out humanity That's also happening slowly Magnetic uh pole reversal is definitely happening The North Pole is moving and we just talked about this a couple weeks ago It's like a couple feet per year right it was like 12 feet per year Is that right Steve yeah Yeah it was like a few feet I don't know A few feet per and it's increasing and the overall strength of the magnetic field is is decreasing So we're definitely in the early stages probably of a magnetic pole reversal but these things take thousands of years to play out So this is what we should be studying more not like going to Mars in my opinion but we are learning a lot about the magnetic or electromagnetic environment by looking in space So I will say that But that's what I'm trying to get out here is we are designed for this electromagnet magnetic environment that goes on into the earth So I usually evolved here I usually start podcast with telling people that but we're doing the opposite here because I want people to know that we are electromagnetic beings And the Schuman's resonance for example is a phenomenon where lightning strikes uh occur and there's an electromagnetic resonance in in the cavity in the atmosphere and the earth's naturally resonating like 7 to eight hertz uh in its first harmonic That's the same frequency as our alpha brain wave And you know that's that's not a coincidence that that occurs And then when we have these low frequency fields from technology it of course it's going to have an a potential effect on our mental states Yeah And that's something that again is is very esoteric for for mainstream science and and medicine but but it but it's the truth and the overall acknowledgment that that we just need to to study more phenomenons on on the electromagnetic environment And the other point I want to make here is that this is all very localized So if I if I were to give a recommendation for health it's not only you know getting outdoors is beneficial and getting connected to your environment is beneficial because we are designed to take all the input signals from our local environment but that local environment is different depending where you are So what you're doing in Florida and what I'm doing in Wyoming is different like and different modalities and foods and things will affect us differently because the electromagnetic environment is different There's a different magnetic field coming out of the earth at different directional vectors and that's where all this gets really complicated because there are things such as resonance with certain molecules in our body uh that are interacting with with various fields such as the electromagnetic field of the earth and depending on your location it's going to have a different effect So if we do research this stuff there's just so many confounding independent variables to consider And I hope someone has the foresight to think about all of that But that's also why where you live and embracing the local environment and season is is very important because we're we're cyclical creatures and everything that goes on even the magnetic field of the earth has a rhythm Our circadian rhythms the seasonality um I'm I'm very big on on all of that stuff and it's kind of nuanced So even the mainstream health influencers like you know they live on a beach somewhere in the tropics you really shouldn't always follow their advice if you live in the Northeast and it's January right um okay So this says the magnetic uh the pole has been moving at a rate of 45 km per year northn northwest You said feet You're off by a little bit So what's 45 km to feet a lot Really What is it that's like 30 m Oh [ __ ] 45 km is like 30 m That's That's crazy If that's real Is it that much wow Yeah Almost exactly 27 miles per year Oh my god That's what we should be studying Like I think somebody has to be studying that Not not enough Not that I've seen Maybe they just don't want to let the public know Because if you're in charge and you're figuring out that this earth's about to flip do a pole flip Are you going to tell the public it's hard That that would be the equivalent of telling there's an alien invasion Do you think i think so Yeah In 222 years the pole will be flipped completely I I don't think that's what if it's moving at that Yeah that seems off That has to be off Brave I don't know I like Brave but Brave is the [[Bitcoin]] browser Well well the the planet is uh 6,000 miles across Is that right i don't know Try ask see what Chrome has to say All I know is that these pole reversals do take thousands of years and then it can just happen like all of a sudden So it can it does accelerate over time Yeah Well it has to do with like the ice sheets getting really heavy right and then melting and getting really light and then that has to like somehow like releases the the crust from the core or the mantle rather and then makes the outer outer part of the earth So so okay so 8,000 miles is the diameter of the Earth So so well we'll figure out ask first 8,000 divided by 27 Find out if it's really 27 miles per year That that might not be real That would be what I would be I would try another browser You got to have two You can't just have you can't we can't just rely on uh on Brave But folks like you can't just rely on Chrome You got to you got to you got to hedge your bets a little bit Check your sources do your own research Then then we'll ask China what they say our earth uh north pole is shifting their new was it deepseek oh yeah deepseek but that's something Robert Obecker even wrote about He was like pole reversals have been correlated with like 80% of all extin extinction events and he wrote about that in the 80s I don't even know if that's exactly true but I'd imagine it it would be The earth pole is currently drifting at a speed of 31 to 37 miles per year Wow Here's the So who is this according to hit show more This is This is Google AI It used to be six and now it's 30 That's frightening Oh wow From 9 to 37 So this is why Elon is trying to get us to Mars I would be concerned I didn't know is that that's insane That means the compasses aren't going to work very soon folks Right Like soon Like two in a 100 years It's going to be halfway there I guess that's why in less than a hundred years will be more than halfway flipped Well at one point the idea is that it goes and then it just like the the ice cap gets so heavy just Yeah just like that's that's that could be a chaotic uh and how are we going to get to Mars bro dude how how are we going to get to the moon how are we going to get through the Van Allen radiation belt that but that is another um example of like why our electromagnetic environment is so important people they go up there they get osteoporosis they get all these chronic diseases what's that thing called that he was uh that Jack was speaking about the pregnalone steel syndrome so all the astronauts had to uh they all came back with like virtually no testosterone yeah hormonal dysfunction I guess that's legit I mean it's all regulated by electromagnetism at the end of the day at the lowest level and that's where even you know supplements for for example you know antioxidants oxidative signaling in our body is is so important because that's what's reacting with our electromagnetic environment like um free radicals and and oxygen in general um paramagnetic um molecules in our body So if we just like blunt all of that all the time you're really blunting the ability to take in the input signals of your environment which could be problematic could be beneficial if you're traveling How [ __ ] are we going to be if we end up having to move to the Earth or the or I mean to the moon or to Mars i don't Are you going to be on one of the journeys to go to the Are you just going to stay here and go down with the ship i will stay here I am not moving to Mars Dude that's hard So unhealthy for us Like it's going to it's going to like I can't imagine what it's going to look like but human lifespan is probably going to go down so much Do you know what I can't I can't believe how resilient we are in our current state This is what's cool I can't believe with all this stuff we're talking about we're still walking around like you know people are drinking four cups of coffee and whatever stimulants and dep anti-depressants but we're doing pretty good for how much toxic stuff is in the environment And even travel like I can get on a flight to Australia and somehow my body figures it out I don't feel great Um and the problem I've found is once you get hyperconnected to your environment you become more sensitive to being uprooted and going somewhere else It is hard to kill people But it is hard It is damn hard to kill people It is hard to kill I had the I uh there's this documentary called um Mr Death Have you ever seen it no It's this dude who um his dad worked for the Bureau of Prisons and they had one of their electric chairs went bad and they had to fix it So he brought to his house and his son started tinkering around with it Figured out how to make it work Figured out how to make it work better They brought it back at work So now he became the repair man for the electric chair Next thing you know they're like "Oh [ __ ] we gota the the states are making us come up with more humane ways of uh executing people." So he came up with gas chambers Then he came up with the lethal injections And this kid that was just like had no background in this stuff just figured out how to fix an electric chair was now in charge of uh implementing all of the execution devices across all the prisons around the country Wow And he was in his book or in his documentary he just he explains like a lot of them didn't [ __ ] work Like people weren't dying They were just getting like tortured And he was like it like the human body is really hard to kill Yeah And that's where people are like "Well where is everyone dropping dead from all the cell phones or what name your toxin and like where's everyone dropping dead?" I'm like "Well this stuff takes a long time to manifest." And it's the death by a thousand cuts That's the problem with any of these There's so many like I you know we asked Steve to pull up that chart about electrification and and chronic disease or heart disease That's a great chart It's cool Like look um all the cool states in the Northeast New Jersey Massachusetts New York they had the most the highest percentage of electrification and they had the highest rate of heart disease um at that time period But this is from uh Okay So this is 1940 This is one year One year Yeah So it's just a snapshot in in time So again but guess what else new York Massachusetts New Jersey maybe they had Crisco and maybe they had other stuff that was toxic But it is pretty compelling And again it's just another factor to consider in your environment that is foreign and based on the research and our knowledge of how biology works if you dig deep enough is toxic or is potentially disruptive And the thing about like the flu and the solar cycles like we are so disconnected from our electromagnetic environment How is the flu connected to the solar cycles again that's just like a maybe Steve can look that up too but but apparently what Arthur Fenberg wrote about was before telecom cables were put underneath or in society in the late 1800s the flu was more of a uncommon like it came around for a couple years and then left for like five six years and it was more tied to the solar cycles which I again I wouldn't be surprised with but you're going to have to try and find some very unbiased information Oh yeah it's going to be pretty hard Um yeah Um well like in general but in antiquity people were dying from [ __ ] plagues left and right Like there was a plague every five years That's something different I think it was more so like the annual like what's known as the the common flu like every winter Um not like the bubanic plague or you know some crazy infectious disease So that that's something something different But we're doing a lot better than we were back then Yeah And that's right I don't want to romanticize the past totally because people yeah they were living outside but but they were they were struggling with infectious diseases but the thing that the mainstream likes to paint oh we're healthier as a society because of lifespan but you know they had kids dying when they were eight and that skews all the numbers mortality rate was like 50% back then child birth mortality as well and you can look at again like what is health span versus lifespan that's like a whole debate well I think it's always been the same as far as we The maximum the maximum Correct Obviously people were dying from from hand to hand combat plagues famine you know all that stuff war But a healthy individual that didn't get murdered or didn't die from a plague would live the same exact time same exact lifespan back in as far as we know like BC Yeah Than that we do now Yeah And that's where the longevity biohacking community I'm like I don't know It's going to be interesting to see but I'm focused on I always wonder about that guy the Brian Johnson guy I talked to him this past weekend We were at the same like health uh event in Austin and I was like what are you doing about light and EMFs he's like I'm pretty cognizant of light You know he doesn't go outside very much or he's in the shade And but he was open to the EMFs He's like we've looked into it but we're not convinced I was like well try it out We've looked into it Oh he has like a whole team of like people Yeah he does I I think I like his intent You know I'm not going to you know talk bad about anyone Like he's on his own wavelength If he thinks he's God and like wants to live forever by all means at least time will tell right he's putting money into telling us like which products are maybe more using his himself as a science experiment right yeah So at least we know what's going on But I'm my goal is to convince him that sunlight is is is good for you even though he doesn't buy into it Not the ultraviolet get him and Jack Cruz into a room That will never work You got to meet people where they are But the EMFs he's open to So I'm going to send him some papers and it's like dude what do you have to lose like you want to live forever what do you need your Wi-Fi on a night but he goes to bed like he is a he's committed So you have to respect that But I don't think you know all these anti-aging expert experts I think we know far less than we think we know Yeah I think so too about biology especially and what I am excited about one of the few things I'm excited about for AI is like how do you create a tool that can parse like there's thousands and thousands of studies on EMFs let's say there there are and I can't read all of them I could post one on Twitter for the next 10 years every single day and that wouldn't even be all of them and then you can't find all of them and then you you know have to piece it together so if there was a tool with the proper guidance I think we could learn so much uh about how biology is is actually functioning and then if we act if we fund real research that's what's promising but we're we're just we're not even scratching the surface Well how I mean that that the EMF topic seems like the most damned topic of all of them because just look at the lobbying in the food industry and then the pharmaceutical industry Now the telecom industry like and guess what how much money I'd be interested to find this out Steve How much money does the telecom industry make compared to the pharmaceutical industry like how much do they spend on And we can just do the math on how much lobbying they I got the lobbying numbers Oh you have it yeah I have it written down right here What is it in 2018 it for AT&T uh was 18.5 million Verizon 12 million The CTIA and the NCTA they're like basically associations that represent the telecom industry So like vouching for them fighting for the rights was another like 22 million That was in 2018 I looked up more recent numbers and it's about like you know 50 20 to 50% higher now So it's a lot They're probably lobbying like a hund00 million a year uh which is nothing compared to what they make but it's it's pretty high The global pharma industry um is estimated to be worth 1.2 trillion uh which will grow to more than 1.5 trillion by 2020 Okay this is old by 2021 Um the pharmaceutical industry generates 550 billion in revenue in 2021 All right Well let's look at the telecom industry Oh here we go By comparison the telecom industry with a global revenue over five around 5 trillion is significantly larger than the pharmaceutical industry which estimated to be worth 1.2 trillion Uh almost five times bigger It's way bigger Wow And guess what we said earlier is like and they're working for the NSA at the same time So like we're [ __ ] dude But the thing with the food and the pharmaceuticals you actually have a choice Do you really have a choice about your electromagnetic environment right now not really Less of a choice right because it's invisible It's invisible Plus um there's no consent to where the infrastructure goes and we have to use it You don't have to take medication You can choose pretty deliberately about your food Like you could go buy it from a farmer Right now there are not really great alternatives for tech There's literally no alternatives for telecom We all use Verizon 18 at like it's a monopoly um in all facets There's no choice Yeah And then if you look at the FCC if you want to talk about corrupted three-letter agencies I mean they haven't updated their guidelines since 1996 The former like heads of the CTIA and I think the general counsel of Verizon were their last two commissioners I think the guy [[Donald Trump|Trump]] put in now has kind of he's kind of okay I've seen him reser referred to as like the 5G ZAR in a good way Like he Trump I don't know Brendan Carr I think is his name I don't know enough about him but I mean Trump loves 5G He's like we're going to have the best 5G He loves 5G He just you know he's a business he's a business guy So he just like he also loves the uh the warp speed operation warp speed So it's um Brandon Carr is the senior Republican on the Federal uh communications commission having served so uh yeah what's his bent here he's like a legal FCC like guy Okay So and he's anti- 5G No he's pro 5G I shouldn't have said Zar I should have said something else But okay I don't think we're going to I I'm curious to see because guess what you got you got Trump who's like loves 5G and tech and 6G He he just says 6G Oh yeah that's I mean that's next Yeah So we're going to have 6G It's going to be it's going to be so big It's going to be great Like before we are somewhat behind China in terms of telecommunications cuz um the roll out for 5G did take a while So you have those two Well at least we're not installing the Huawei bases all over here anymore Yeah That are just listening to to everything So we're smart about that The US military still buys like Chinese drones but at least we're getting Do they really yeah I'm pretty sure Um and that seems silly There's no way we Who makes all our drone like not military drones no but Well I don't know for sure but anyway we make all our products in China So like these are all made in China Yeah they are So we're kind of stuck in that regard But what I'm saying is we got Trump who's pro 5G 6G We got Elon Elon you need to acknowledge that EMFs are potentially harmful for your biology So that's all I got to say because he's been on Rogan and be like you could you could put something like a million times stronger than your phone up to your head and it wouldn't have any effect Like he said some stupid stuff But again look he also says that there's no evidence for any kind of advanced propulsion systems by any aerospace industries He don't thinks alien he doesn't think aliens are in interesting and he thinks that we can go to Mars even though we haven't been to the moon in 54 years Yeah He's also highly intelligent and highly strategic So I'm I'm sure he's not just going to say what actually makes sense Um very highly strategic for the public But like I don't know it kind of like is he that like but but why are you on Twitter all day every day just like I don't know posting boring like not even funny memes and then you have RFK So I'm like hm how is this going to play out i'm very curious to see if there is anything Maybe they let RFK just do some research funding on EMFs but this is where consumer demand like consumer opinion and voicing of concerns is actually what drives change And I think spreading awareness that this is a real thing It's not a conspiracy theory It's a it's a real thing Go look at the studies Go read some of these books Invisible Rainbow Cross Currents Zapping of America Microwave Debate Some of these you can't even find anymore You have to find the PDF and they're from 50 years ago But but there's a lot there's a lot of great researchers Henry Lie Martin Powell you know Robert Obecker um Alan Frey [[Robert O Becker|Robert O Becker]] was in that book The Pentagon's Brain There's a whole fascinating episode on him where he talks about limb He was a guy who was about limb regeneration right Yeah It's f that's it's fascinating And that's where he discovered like bone was semiconductive That's where he discovered that there's little electrical currents that stimulate you know cell repair cell regeneration limb regeneration And now they're studying how magnetic fields can alter that um as well And it's highly dependent on the frequency the intensity the directionality So there's there's so many independent variables there But yeah we're that was 70s maybe when he studied that So there was so much like we could have made so much progress and that all just got shut down And he was on 60 60 Minutes I'm pretty sure Alan Frey went on 60 Minutes So if you want to dig up some some fun archives there you go Tristan thanks man This has been a great podcast [ __ ] mind-blowing stuff Um tell people where
