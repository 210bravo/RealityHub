## Summary of the Exothermic Core-Mantle Decoupling ‚Äì Dzhanibekov Oscillation (ECDO) Theory

The ECDO Theory, developed by The Ethical Skeptic, proposes a geophysical mechanism linking Earth's core dynamics to periodic cataclysmic events, including climate change, mass extinctions, and global inundations. It integrates evidence from geophysics, archaeology, and ancient mythology to suggest that Earth undergoes cyclic rotational instabilities driven by core-mantle decoupling, leading to significant geological and climatic shifts.

---

### Core Hypothesis

The ECDO Theory posits that Earth‚Äôs rotational dynamics are influenced by two competing equilibrium mechanisms: geomagnetic coupling between the core and mantle, and gyroscopic stability driven by mass distribution in the mantle. These dynamics result in periodic True Polar Wander (TPW) events, mediated by a Dzhanibekov-like rotation, where the Earth‚Äôs outer rotational body (ORB, comprising the mantle and crust) decouples from the core at the D‚Äù layer (the core-mantle boundary). This decoupling is triggered by an exothermic phase change in the core‚Äôs hexagonal close-packed iron (HCP-Fe), which transfers heat and mass into the mantle, altering its density and rotational stability.

The theory identifies two critical inflection points:

1. **Indigo Point:** The onset of core-mantle decoupling, marked by a weakening geomagnetic moment, heat transfer into the mantle, and ocean/tundra warming due to methane and CO‚ÇÇ release.
2. **Tau Point:** A catastrophic TPW event, where the ORB rotates approximately 104¬∞ along the 31¬∞ E meridian, shifting the geographic North Pole (Np) to a new position (Np‚Äô) near the South Africa Cusp (SAC-LLVP).

This cycle, termed the ECDO oscillation, alternates between State 1 (geomagnetically coupled, stable rotation) and State 2 (gyroscopically mediated, decoupled rotation), potentially explaining historical cataclysms and modern climate anomalies.

### Key Geophysical Mechanisms

1. **Core-Mantle Decoupling:**
    - The Earth‚Äôs core, composed of HCP-Fe, undergoes exothermic phase changes, releasing heat and material into the mantle, particularly excluding Large Low-Velocity-Shear Provinces (LLVPs) beneath Africa (SAC-LLVP) and the Pacific (PAC-LLVP).
    - These LLVPs, being less dense, form a minimum inertia axis, while the denser, heat-infused mantle forms a maximum inertia axis, creating a gyroscopic imbalance.
    - The D‚Äù layer acts as a lubricant, allowing independent rotation of the core and ORB, akin to a Dzhanibekov effect, but mediated to a 104¬∞ shift rather than a full 180¬∞ flip.
2. **Dzhanibekov Dynamics:**
    - The Dzhanibekov Effect describes rotational instability in objects with three distinct moments of inertia. For Earth, the SAC-LLVP and PAC-LLVP act as low-density axes, destabilizing rotation when geomagnetic coupling weakens.
    - The theory predicts a True Polar Wander event, shifting the rotational axis to align with the SAC-LLVP centroid (31¬∞ E, ~13.5¬∞ S), corroborated by NASA‚Äôs EGM2008 geoid maps showing mass distribution anomalies.
3. **Thermal and Climatic Impacts:**
    - Exothermic core activity drives oceanic and tundra warming, with ENSO events linked to heat plumes along Euler Axes (120¬∞ E, 60¬∞ W).
    - The theory challenges the attribution of modern climate change solely to anthropogenic causes, suggesting a significant contribution from core-derived heat.

---

### Deductive Evidence

The ECDO Theory relies on deductive critical path science, prioritizing falsification over linear induction. Key evidence includes:

1. **Geophysical Data:**
    - LLVP Tomography: Seismic studies (e.g., Tsekhmistrenko et al., 2021) confirm the SAC-LLVP‚Äôs centroid at 31¬∞ E, 104¬∞ from the current North Pole, aligning with the proposed Np‚Äô position.
    - Paleomagnetic Records: Excursions like the Laschamp Event (41,000 years ago) and Iceland Basin Excursion (187,000 years ago) follow the 31¬∞ E meridian, suggesting historical TPW events.
    - Gravitational Anomalies: NASA‚Äôs GRACE data (Exhibit J2a) supports the three-moment inertia model, with the SAC-LLVP as the minimum inertia axis.
2. **Archaeological Evidence:**
    - Khufu Pyramid: The pyramid‚Äôs star shafts form a 104¬∞ angle, aligning with Np and Np‚Äô from Giza and the Geographic Center of the World (31¬∞ E, 38¬∞ N). The Queen‚Äôs Chamber copper cables suggest geomagnetic monitoring, while the Subterranean Chamber may detect D‚Äù layer P-waves (5‚Äì10 Hz).
    - Global Monuments: Stone circles (e.g., Flagstones, Newgrange) and Nazca Lines align with Np‚Äô (326¬∞/146¬∞ or 107.9¬∞ True), indicating ancient awareness of TPW.
    - Nubian Ostrich Egg: A 6,500-year-old artifact with pyramid and 104¬∞ markings suggests knowledge of celestial pole shifts.
3. **Mythological Corroboration:**
    - Over 175 global flood myths, including the Epic of Gilgamesh and Chinese N√ºwa myth, describe rapid oceanic inundations (~6.5 days on average), consistent with a TPW-induced surge.
    - Myths like the Hopi legend and Herodotus‚Äô account describe Earth‚Äôs axis shifts, aligning with the 31¬∞ E meridian and 104¬∞ rotation.
4. **Genetic and Ecological Patterns:**
    - The Neolithic Y-chromosome bottleneck (3000‚Äì5000 BCE) indicates a global culling of 19/20 male lineages, suggesting a cataclysmic event survived by select groups.
    - Biodiversity clusters at Euler Axes (121¬∞ E, 59¬∞ W) and Sub-Saharan Africa, shielded by high deserts, align with predicted survival zones during inundation.
    - Saline soil distribution matches oceanic displacement patterns from a 104¬∞ TPW event.

### Khufu Pyramid as a Geophysical Observatory

The theory proposes that the Khufu Pyramid was a tripartite observatory designed to detect TPW onset:

1. King‚Äôs Chamber: Monitors celestial pole nutation and TPW via star shafts aligned to Np and Np‚Äô.
2. Queen‚Äôs Chamber: Tracks geomagnetic moment changes using copper cables as a dipole antenna (0.664‚Äì5.34 MHz), sensitive to ionospheric and geomagnetic fluctuations.
3. Subterranean Chamber: Detects D‚Äù layer P-waves (5‚Äì10 Hz) via infrasound, possibly using mercury as a sensing medium.

The pyramid‚Äôs scale and design optimize signal detection, with its Tura limestone acting as a piezoelectric amplifier and its granite components dissipating heat from high-amperage systems. The 104¬∞ shaft angle and 9¬∞ Subterranean Chamber offset align with the SAC-LLVP, reinforcing the pyramid‚Äôs role as a warning system for cataclysmic shifts.

### Implications and Paradigm Shift

The ECDO Theory challenges conventional archaeology and climate science, which the author critiques for linear induction and confirmation bias. It advocates deductive critical path science, emphasizing falsification and interdisciplinary evidence. 

**Key implications include:**

- Climate Change: Core-derived heat may contribute significantly to modern warming, misattributed to human activity alone.
- Archaeological Reevaluation: Ancient monuments like Khufu and G√∂bekli Tepe suggest advanced geophysical knowledge, potentially predating the Fourth Dynasty (e.g., 9200‚Äì9600 BCE for Khufu‚Äôs shafts).
- Existential Questions: The theory raises philosophical concerns about humanity‚Äôs placement on a geologically unstable planet, suggesting intentional obfuscation of this knowledge by ancient or modern entities.

---

### Critiques and Limitations

- Unfalsifiable Prediction: The timing of the Tau Point is indefinite, weakening its testability.
- Speculative Elements: References to ancient aliens or Antarctic structures (e.g., Spartan 1 findings) are not critical to the hypothesis but invite skepticism.
- Data Gaps: Paleomagnetic and ice core records lack the resolution to detect short-term (50‚Äì400 years) TPW events, necessitating reliance on indirect evidence like myths and monuments.

---

### Conclusion

The ECDO Theory offers a comprehensive framework linking Earth‚Äôs core dynamics, rotational instability, and historical cataclysms. By integrating geophysical, archaeological, and mythological evidence, it proposes that the Khufu Pyramid served as a sophisticated observatory to monitor TPW events, driven by core-mantle decoupling and Dzhanibekov-like rotations. While speculative in parts, its deductive approach and alignment with diverse evidence sets demand serious consideration, challenging entrenched scientific narratives and urging a paradigm shift in understanding Earth‚Äôs history and future risks.


## Thread:

Exothermic Core-Mantle Decoupling ‚Äì Dzhanibekov Oscillation theory (ECDO Theory) is a series of hypotheses regarding climate change and its relationship to the dynamics of the Earth‚Äôs core, as well as geophysical, monument, artifact, and mythological evidence surrounding global cataclysms. It is solely the work of its author,¬†_The Ethical Skeptic_, who developed the theory from 2010 until its first hypothesis publication on February 16, 2020.

The following material presents one of three novel hypotheses, each developed by the author through decades of dedicated professional and independent research. These original hypotheses form the foundation of The Ethical Skeptic‚Äôs ECDO Theory, which is summarized in¬†[this separate summary article](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/23/master-exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-theory/).

> _The ECDO hypothesis proposes a regular cycling of a natural dynamic system. Our Earth just happens to have two mechanisms of equilibrium battling for dominance. The strength of the geomagnetic core determines which one is winning at any given time._  
>   
> _It is our contention that we are now well past an Indigo Point of exothermic core-mantle decoupling, and that we have incorrectly interpreted the heat presented by this transpiration as being caused by man‚Äôs activity alone. We now face the urgent need to detect the approach of a subsequent Tau Point Dzhanibekov oscillation in Earth‚Äôs rotation. During such an event, the outer rotational body (ORB) of the Earth, comprising the mantle and crust, decouples from the core at the D‚Äù layer. This decoupling is central to the mediated Dzhanibekov Rotation hypothesis discussed in this paper._  
>   
> _For decades, I was taught to view such a rotation and its resulting inundation as impossibilities, and I believed it. However, we lack the ability to distinguish a Dzhanibekov rotation from a geomagnetic pole excursion or flip. How, then, can we be so certain? My confidence in this long-held dogma has been shaken to its core._

Decades ago, as a junior consultant still wet behind the ears, I was tasked with a project to boost the profitability of a men‚Äôs apparel retailer based on Manhattan‚Äôs Fifth Avenue. This brand had been a staple for nearly a century, the type of establishment likely frequented by characters from the series¬†_Mad Men_¬†during their lunch-hour shopping sprees or a surgical strike to replace a stained or substandard shirt before an important board meeting.

The retailer was facing brand erosion due to decades of stodgy bureaucracy and competition from more agile newcomers on Fifth Avenue. Men‚Äôs business shirts, particularly in blue and white, served as the anchor product or loss leader (when on sale) for this retail class. These shirts drew customers into the store from 10 AM to 4 PM, however the retailer was losing ground inside this segment. Sales of these staple shirts were declining, signaling broader challenges as customers took their money elsewhere.

Dressed in my best Hugo Boss suit, I spent several hours over multiple days in apparent nonchalance observing the men‚Äôs apparel department. I noticed shoppers‚Äô frustration with finding the right combination of sleeve length, collar size, and button details within the brief time they allotted themselves for shopping. Typically, they had only 5 to 8 minutes to make a purchase. If they couldn‚Äôt find what they needed quickly, they left without buying anything else‚Äîand more importantly, they didn‚Äôt return.

To address this, I devised a nightly recovery process within the men‚Äôs dress shirts department. Every night at 10:30 PM, a stocking associate used a cart I had specially designed (one offered still in retail supply catalogs to this day) to remove all shirts from the sales floor and take them to the basement stockroom‚Äîpart of the problem as well being shirts hidden out of customer sight as a result of this very recovery issue. There, the associate would restock each 10-shirt bin in the cart, organized by size, style, and color, heel-toed, and squared to perfection. No torn bags, no jumble-folds, no out-of-place or missing product tags. At around 8 AM the next morning, the shirts were returned to the sales floor, ready for the next sales day. Every fixture filled to perfection.

Rarity can drive price, but abundance drives interest. This system ensured that every customer could find the exact shirt they needed within seconds, purchase it, and leave within 8 minutes. This change realized several key benefits: high-wage sales associates were freed up to assist customers rather than reorganize stock, customers knew they could rely on finding what they needed in short order, affording them time to think of other things they needed, and the store saw less requirement for overstock sales due to improved presentation and less hidden inventory.

A year later, the Vice President of the retailer, who had initially dismissed the idea as ‚Äòcrazy,‚Äô called to thank me. The project had not only tripled sales and doubled store traffic during critical hours but had also increased department profitability five-fold. He had won the company‚Äôs annual award for the initiative. This experience underscored the crucial distinction in brand management of comprehending value versus cost, or seeing the forest despite the trees standing in the way.

**Tree Dwellers and Tactical Fixation**

No doubt, this article will be spun by science poseurs as constituting ‚Äòconspiracy theory.‚Äô This will only highlight the sad state of affairs within science, particularly in archaeology and Egyptology. Much of science today operates under a practice I describe as ‚Äòlinear (incremental) induction.‚Äô[1](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-84997)¬†We start by formulating the official and correct answer (in this case, the 1837 ‚ÄòKhufu-Fourth Dynasty Narrative‚Äô), which we then mislabel as a¬†[hypothesis](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2018/12/13/the-elements/). From there, we assemble a collection of observations which might appear to support or p-value our preconceived notion, while mandating that useful idiots socially discredit all competing theories or parties without substantial evidence. All the while hypocritically¬†[bemoaning the presence of any dissent](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GOIWM5IW0AAyYd8.png)¬†inside those same social mechanisms. An example of this pathological old world syndicate elite thinking can be seen¬†[by clicking here](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Horrid-take.png).

This constitutes a severe form of confirmation bias called in military parlance ‚Äòtactical fixation‚Äô. Such a process is particularly vulnerable to manipulation by external influences (agency as opposed to mere bias), leading to what we referred to in a¬†[previous article](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/04/24/syndicate-science-the-definition/)¬†as the ‚ÄòNelsonian Ignorance Trap.‚Äô

![](https://i0.wp.com/theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Science-A-3.png?resize=869%2C127&ssl=1)

However, there exists a less common yet much more potent method of discovery, which conceives of science as an evolutionary process rather than a collection of immutable truths, inductive incremental validations, and entrenched syndicates. I refer to this approach as deductive critical path science, akin to ‚Äòworking the problem‚Äô as known in detective work or military contexts. It begins with falsification of various notions and constructs supported by weak inductive evidence, and culminates in a living, breathing, sometimes threatening, theory ‚Äì as opposed to standing dogma. This version of science does not require hordes of ‚Äòscience enthusiasts‚Äô in order to maintain the faithful inside a state of belief.

![](https://i0.wp.com/theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Science-B-3.png?resize=869%2C127&ssl=1)

Furthermore, peer review falls short in encompassing the essence of ‚Äòworking the problem‚Äô; instead, it often dismisses ideas perceived as unfamiliar or abhorrent by resorting to critique of tactics and trivialities. Researchers are acutely aware of this reality and as a consequence often limit their conclusions to highly constrained ‚Äòmight-be‚Äô inference, title their work in a manner that does not accurately represent the study‚Äôs conclusions, express their findings in cryptic language, or embellish their work with excessive heuristic ornamentation‚Äîultimately rendering peer review the epitome of conflict of interest. Many researchers have learned how to game this vulnerability.[2](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-84997)¬†[3](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-84997)

The result of all this is that¬†[Narrative Science](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/01/11/the-seven-cs-of-narrative-science/)¬†takes precedence over the actual scientific method, under a tenet of philosophy I call The¬†[Principle of Diminishing Scientific Returns](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/06/13/the-principle-of-diminishing-narrative-returns/). It is for precisely this reason why we often rely on Kuhn-Planck Paradigm Shifts to drive scientific advancement.

Indeed, such activity transforms into a process of ‚Äòworking the solution‚Äô rather than working the core problem, thereby deviating from the fundamental principles of science. Such foible typically can only be perceived by outsiders.

> _Orthodoxies run anathema to innovation; they merely know how to profit from or rule through it._

Truly tackling a problem demands both deep situational awareness, along with innovative and deductive thinking from the outset. Starting the prosecution of a problem with complex and precise math or heuristics indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of how logical calculus operates. As a result, peer review often functions to bolster established club doctrine and, at most, make incremental refinements to what is already deemed correct. Novel ideas often meet their demise at the hands of what constitutes merely methodically applied opinion.

> _The science of evolution was developed through critical path deduction for instance, while in contrast Covid-19 and climate science were promulgated through the awesome insistence of linear induction. These latter sciences have most recently failed us catastrophically._

Throughout my career, I have often been summoned to leadership roles in research and laboratory environments precisely because of this distinction: the prevalent focus on subject fixation to secure science funding contrasts sharply with the objective-driven strategy of working the problem to achieve specific goals.

> _Archaeologists‚Äô unwillingness to develop any research that might remotely suggest a biblical ‚Äòflood‚Äô or ancient aliens hypothesis has led to a compromise in the integrity of science itself. In reality, a religion is defined not by what it accepts as true, but rather by what it embargoes as unworthy._

In the example of the early-career retailer scenario I described above, my role was to work the problem, not incrementally improve the tactics. My purpose was not to produce more inductive evidence as to how correct standing theory indeed was. Standing theory had already failed miserably, and the participants therein did not perceive this. I was tasked with assessing the broader picture‚Äîthe forest‚Äîrather than deepening my expertise and securing additional funding by fixating narrowly on the trees.

**Image 1 ‚Äì Waterline Erosion ‚ÄòDead Body‚Äô Falsification Event**¬†‚Äì Earth‚Äôs oceans have been displaced in the past, and have done so over a significant period of time (50 ‚Äì 400 years). Long enough to carbonic acid dissolve the Tura limestone casing of both the¬†[Khufu and Khafre](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Khafren-Cap-Metrics-3.png)¬†pyramids. If a hypothesis does not explain this specific Khafre erosion waterline feature conclusively, then it is not a scientific hypothesis.

Within this article, readers will be introduced to a hypothesis derived from the critical path deductive process outlined above. A deductive process is not subject to the apophenia that a linear-inductive ‚Äòconnect the dots‚Äô approach might be vulnerable to, as deduction reduces the set of viable explanations rather than promoting a preselected one. To that end, this hypothesis represents the last idea considered, only after all other possibilities have been falsified (see Image 1). It is the alternative one has to be dragged kicking and screaming into objectively assessing, after every other idea has failed.

I want to make it clear that I dislike this alternative. At its heart, the hypothesis involves what is called in philosophy, an ‚Äòunfalsifiable prediction through indefinite timing‚Äô (Point Tau below). I dislike such notions ‚Äì favoring context-and-control testable predictions as one of the¬†[elements of true hypothesis](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2018/12/13/the-elements/). In fact, I opposed this idea vehemently for decades. Like many of my colleagues, I had grown weary of hearing Noah‚Äôs flood theories, and had attained a level of cynicism regarding the matter as well (not skepticism).

However, I was wrong ‚Äì finally setting my mind to develop its probative construct (not a ‚Äòfinal answer‚Äô) only after having falsified every single previously favored notion or alternative I or others could muster.[4](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-84997)¬†Thereafter, this hypothesis exists as a probative construct ‚Äì as there is no possible way for it to be 100% correct out of the box. It is a working and evolving set of ideas‚Äîthoughts that have been doggedly embargoed from the collective consciousness of science.

> _The majority of archaeologists lack extensive seafaring expertise and are not versed in materials science research._¬†_As someone with deep experience in both domains, the significance of what is shown in Image 1 is readily apparent to me. Moreover, if a standing hypothesis fails to address the deductive evidence shown in Image 1, it is not a scientific hypothesis ‚Äì rather a political technology._
> 
> _Deductive evidence, by its nature, imposes a Duty to Address and Inform on all valid hypotheses, requiring them to coherently explain the observation. While inductive evidence may be circumstantial or suggestive, deductive evidence carries a higher burden: it demands acknowledgment and integration into the composition or claims of any valid hypothesis. Deductive evidence compels scientific theories to adapt, refine, or risk invalidation. A hypothesis that fails to incorporate or address such evidence forfeits its validity._

Furthermore, this hypothesis includes several predictive elements that are substantiated upon detailed examination, as will be demonstrated in the subsequent sections of this article and have been outlined in¬†[our preceding article](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2023/12/18/hidden-in-plain-sight/).[5](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-5-84997)¬†Initially, I considered this theory extremely unlikely, comparable to the improbability of conjecturing a murder. Yet, my perspective underwent a dramatic shift after inspecting the¬†[exterior of the Khafre Pyramid](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Khafre-pyramid5-3.png). The¬†[evidence I observed there](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Khafren-Cap-Metrics.png)¬†was as compelling as the discovery of a dead body, motivating me to now pursue this most improbable path. Despite its initial apparent implausibility, this hypothesis presents the most robust ‚Äòprobative construct‚Äô I have encountered regarding this topic, particularly in its description of the ‚Äòfunction‚Äô of the four ‚Äòair shafts‚Äô within the Khufu pyramid. This construct will continue to be modified into the future of course ‚Äì but more importantly, it constitutes a paradigm shift, one which allows science to move forward and no longer wallow in appeal to authority and prior plausibility. Ockham‚Äôs razor has been surpassed, and plurality is now necessary.

> _One can scream all they want about how ‚Äòexperts have concluded‚Ä¶‚Äô. If I find a deceased individual in the living room immediately after a party, it doesn‚Äôt matter how many expert attendees testify that the party went fine; the dead body proves otherwise. Khafre‚Äôs erosion marks constitute a ‚Äòdead body‚Äô.¬†[Khafre ocean submersion](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Khafren-Cap-Metrics-2.png)¬†falsifies convention and serves to introduce a necessary deductive critical path construct, and absolutely everyone is ignoring this._

**The Heat Between Indigo and Tau**

![](https://i0.wp.com/theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/points-indigo-and-tau-1.png?resize=869%2C445&ssl=1)

Points Indigo and Tau are inflection and tipping points that I often utilize when analyzing strategies, campaigns, problems, or deceptions. The Indigo Point is a critical juncture where plans are quietly set in motion, potentially irrevocably, steering towards a predetermined Tau strike point. Although not an exact match, functionally, Point Indigo aligns with Ray Bradbury‚Äôs concept of the¬†[butterfly effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Sound_of_Thunder), where minor, early changes serve to precipitate significant later outcomes. Conversely, Point Tau resembles Malcolm Gladwell‚Äôs notion of a¬†[tipping point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tipping_Point)‚Äî a moment when the issue of outcome becomes apparent and it is too late for direct intervention to alter the course of events.

> _Between points Indigo and Tau, the underlying process may often be concealed, with its elements considered normal, irrelevant, or mistakenly attributed to other factors. At point Tau, all hell breaks loose._

For the sake of comprehension therefore, I have chosen to present the hypothesis described here in terms of both its Indigo and cryptic inception‚Äîwhere actions are subtly set in motion and might even be misinterpreted or misattributed‚Äîand its inevitable Tau strike point, the culmination of the entire set of events.

Indigo-Point Exothermic Core-Mantle Decoupling ‚Äì Tau-Point Dzhanibekov LLVP Oscillation (ECDO)

**Point Indigo (Construct and Critical Path) ‚Äì Exothermic Core-Mantle Decoupling and Heat Transfer Inflection**

![](https://i0.wp.com/theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Rotating-and-Static.gif?resize=538%2C263&ssl=1)

**Exhibit A**¬†‚Äì Heat contribution from the core feeds into the mantle, avoiding the red-hued Large Low-Velocity-Shear Provinces under the south African continent (SAC-LLVP) and Pacific ocean (see Exhibits E and E2).[6](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-6-84997)¬†As a result, these massive structures also become less dense as compared to the surrounding core-fed mantle.

This sequence of events, that we refer to as the Indigo Point set, initiates with a weakening of the core magnetic moment and the associated core-mantle magnetic coupling, which currently influences the position of our geographic North Pole (N_p_) (what we call ‚Äòpriority‚Äô). Following this, there is a transfer of exothermic heat from the core into a network of Large Low-Velocity-Shear Provinces (LLVPs) within the Earth‚Äôs viscoelastic mantle, with the most notable being the ‚ÄòSouth Africa Cusp‚Äô. This activity contributes to consistent and sometimes dramatic ocean warming, as we all¬†[observed in 2023](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Geothermal-Pulse-Banding-4.png), and also leads to the heating of the northern hemisphere tundra ‚Äì with the resulting forced methane release thereby causing methane ppm‚Äôs to significantly exceed forecasts of climate models.

2. Contribution of exothermic kinetic energy (heat) into the Earth‚Äôs mantle (see Exhibit E2), excluding the axially-located Large Low-Velocity-Shear Provinces (LLVP ‚Äì see Exhibit E) ‚Äì which become relatively lower in density as compared to the surrounding core-fed mantle.
3. Causing dramatic ocean SST and northern hemisphere tundra warming, along with a resulting forced carbon dioxide and methane release.

**Exhibit B**¬†‚Äì Conceptual Dzhanibekov Rotation based upon the ECDO Theory and established LLVP lower density axes within the Earth‚Äôs mantle.

In our continued expansion of the ECDO theory, a critical tip-in, or Tau Point, manifests with a significant geological event. This pivotal occurrence involves the substantial contribution of heat from the phase state change of hexagonal close-packed iron (HCP-Fe) into the entire Earth‚Äôs mantle, save for the South Africa Cusp and Pacific Large Low-Velocity-Shear Province (LLVP) group of mantle formations (left side of Exhibit A above). This infusion of dense, metallic mass at a key geodynamic nexus is hypothesized to catalyze an increasing gyroscopic moment commensurate with a reduction in the geomagnetic permeability of the Earth‚Äôs epsilon-lattice hypercrystalline core. The geographic North Pole (N_p_) is theorized to realign to a new position, designated as N_p_‚Äô in Exhibit B to the right, which is projected to occur along the 31¬∞ East Meridian‚Äîa line of longitude notably shared with the ancient and enigmatic Khufu Pyramid. This realignment, shifting approximately 104 degrees, represents a dramatic reorientation of the Earth‚Äôs rotational axis,or what it called a True Polar Wandering (TPW) event,[7](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-7-84997)¬†underpinning the transformative implications of the ECDO theory at this Tau Point.

> D. Once past a specific threshold of reduced magnetic moment, the core-mantle magnetic coupling gives way to a gyroscopically mediated form of Dzhanibekov rotation from N_p_¬†to N_p_‚Äò (104¬∫ along 31¬∫ E longitude ‚Äì the same meridian as the Khufu Pyramid).
> 
> The D‚Äù layer of the core accelerates its exothermic sloughing, and this material-shedding effect serves as a kind of ‚Äòinfinite lubricant‚Äô between the core and the mantle, allowing the two bodies to rotate independently (as shown in Exhibits J and J2b).

It is our contention that we are now well past Point Indigo in this process, have incorrectly interpreted the heat presented by this transpiration as being caused by man‚Äôs activity alone, and now face a need to detect the approach of a Point Tau Gyroscopically Mediated Dzhanibekov rotation.

This broaches the question, How does one go about detecting the onset of such an event?

**Dzhanibekov Dynamics and Rotation**

![](https://i0.wp.com/theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GIF-5-9-2024-11-37-03-PM.gif?resize=629%2C347&ssl=1)

**Exhibit C**¬†‚Äì Pure Dzhanibekov Effect on a symmetrical object rotating in space. Rotation around its intermediate axis forces a flip in the axial dynamics.[8](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-8-84997)

The Dzhanibekov Effect, also known as the tennis racket theorem, refers to a phenomenon observed regarding rotating bodies in space, where an object with three distinct momenta of inertia (axes of rotation) behaves in a counterintuitive way when rotated. Discovered by Russian cosmonaut¬†[Vladimir Dzhanibekov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Dzhanibekov)¬†while in Earth orbit, the effect became particularly famous after he observed a wingnut flipping unexpectedly when spun.

The effect occurs because the intermediate axis theorem states that rotation around the object‚Äôs intermediate axis (neither its maximum nor its minimum inertia axis) is unstable.[9](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-9-84997)¬†When an object such as a tennis racket or a wingnut is tossed with a spin around this intermediate axis, it eventually flips around, rotating about the other axes, leading to a sudden and unexpected shift in orientation.[10](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-10-84997)¬†This surprising behavior highlights unique stability characteristics in rotational dynamics, particularly in the microgravity conditions of space.

![](https://i0.wp.com/theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Mundi-and-Euler.png?resize=387%2C302&ssl=1)

**Exhibit C2 ‚Äì Mundi and Euler Dense Axes**¬†‚Äì contrast sharply with the LLVP axis we estimate (extracted from the cited Wenying, et al.¬†_Geodynamics_¬†2020 study).

While our theory references the Dzhanibekov Effect, it is crucial to understand that Earth‚Äôs real three PIM-axis body application (see Exhibit C2 to right) diverges in part from the classical three-axis definition observed in space (Exhibit C).[11](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-11-84997)¬†Our model does not strictly adhere to the traditional Dzhanibekov Effect definition, where an object flips 180 degrees due solely to rotational instability around its intermediate axis (Exhibit C above). Instead, we explore how similar principles could influence Earth‚Äôs rotational dynamics under different conditions, specifically,

1. a reduction in the geomagnetic coupling between the Earths‚Äô epsilon-lattice hypercrystalline core and its mantle as the core‚Äôs geomagnetic moment, which helps to keep the present polar rotational axis as priority, fades,
2. destabilization caused by the Earth‚Äôs hotter mantle versus less-dense Large Low-Velocity-Shear Provinces (LLVPs), and in particular the center of low-mass in the South Africa Cusp LLVP. This core material infusion can potentially polarize the Earth‚Äôs rotational momentum, leading to significant shifts in the planet‚Äôs rotation around its maximum axis (the remaining dense mantle), and
3. a gyroscopic 104 degrees (relative to the current polar axis, see Exhibits H and J) mediation of the Dzhanibekov effect‚Äînot the 0 to 180 degrees typically illustrated in simpler physical models (Exhibit C).

This adjustment in our theoretical approach highlights the unique application and adaptation of rotational dynamics principles to the geological and magnetic complexities of Earth‚Äôs interior. The theory thus introduces the terms ‚Äòdynamics‚Äô, ‚Äòmediated‚Äô, and ‚Äòrotation‚Äô to describe these complex interactions rather than a direct ‚Äòeffect‚Äô in terms of Dzhanibekov‚Äôs observation with regard to rotating 3-axis bodies.

**Exhibit D**¬†**‚Äì South Africa Cusp**¬†‚Äì Large Low-Velocity-Shear Province (SAC-LLVP) tomography structures (red) and centroid (yellow) at the southern tip of the African continent. The lighter axial centroid of the SAC-LLVP aligns precisely with the 31st East Meridian, which also passes through the Giza Plateau‚Äîpositioned 104 degrees offset from the current North Pole.[12](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-12-84997)

Large Low-Shear-Velocity Provinces (LLVPs) are significant geophysical features located deep within the Earth‚Äôs viscoelastic mantle, particularly at the boundary with the core, ranging upwards towards the asthenosphere of the Earth, to around 2,900 kilometers below the surface. These regions are differentiated by their seismic properties; specifically, seismic waves travel through these structures at slower speeds as compared to surrounding materials. This anomalous behavior suggests that LLVPs are both hotter and less dense than the majority of the Earth‚Äôs mantle.

There are two primary LLVP structures, which we refer to herein as ‚ÄòSAC‚Äô for South Africa Cusp, and ‚ÄòPAC‚Äù, for Pacific. Both are rather massive, about twice the size of our moon, and constitute a sizeable differential in terms of georotational mass moment.[13](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-13-84997)¬†[14](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-14-84997)

> _Bear in mind that the Earth‚Äôs mantle is anisotropic, while most of our tomography and science concerning mantle density and specifically Large Low-Shear-Velocity Provinces (LLVPs) has been developed within the last decade_.

**Exhibit E ‚Äì LLVP Formation Less-Dense Axial Centroids**¬†‚Äì align at the 30¬∞E/150¬∞W meridians, while being 104 degrees offset from the current North Pole, inside the south tip of the African continent.[15](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-15-84997)¬†Chart is from the referenced Mcnamara, et al. study, however the yellow and text annotations are ours.

The two LLVP structures are found beneath Africa and the Pacific Ocean ‚Äì acting like low-density poles along a kind of gyroscopic axis of their own within the Earth‚Äôs mantle. They are massive in scale, each covering a substantial portion of the lower mantle. These formations are regarded to be potentially less dense than the surrounding mantle matrix. While in contrast, the orthogonal (90-degrees of longitude offsets ‚Äì 30_¬∞_E ‚Äì 120_¬∞_E ‚Äì 150_¬∞_W ‚Äì 60_¬∞_W) below-identified Euler axes are denser and vary little in their relative density to each other (‚ñ≥PIM (A, B, C) = .35%).[16](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-16-84997)¬†We believe this interleaving of heat and low density zones, by the 90-degree intervals depicted in Exhibits E and E2, to be no coincidence.

> _Thus, there is a clear perpendicular relationship between the True Polar Wander (30¬∞E and 150¬∞W meridians) great circle and ENSO geothermal heating along the orthogonal Euler Axes (120¬∞E and 60¬∞W meridians) great circle._

**Exhibit E2 ‚Äì Contrasting Orthogonal Euler Axis Heating Centroids**¬†‚Äì align at 120¬∞E/60¬∞W longitudes. Oceanic heating centers on these East and West Euler Axes, which we also identify through other analytical approaches later in this article.[17](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-17-84997)

Moreover, these Euler Axis geographic points both reside at the east and west centroids of sustained oceanic heating ([ENSO or El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation events](https://www.climate.gov/enso)). We conjecture that this heat originates from the latent energy of phase-changing core hexagonal closepack iron (HCP-Fe) being introduced from the Earth‚Äôs core and into its mantle.[18](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-18-84997)

This mass adds to the overall mass of the maximum moment inside the Earth‚Äôs 3-PIM rotational body, helping to precipitate a True Polar Wander event. The LLVP formations in contrast (Exhibit E), serve as a minimum axis, with the rest of the mantle forming a hot 3-PIM maximum-axis set (Exhibit E2). This matches as well, the¬†[differential stresses of tectonic plates](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Tectonic-Plates.png), between the Euler Axis zones and the remainder of the Earth‚Äôs crust.[19](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-19-84997)¬†When combined, these serve to gyroscopically compete with the magnetically coupled axis, as well as mitigate a pure 180 degree Dzhanibekov rotation departure from that geomagnetic axis.

As can be seen in Exhibit E, the central part of the African Large Low-Shear-Velocity Province (LLVP) lies beneath south tip of the African plate, with hotspots appearing to concentrate along the LLVP‚Äôs boundary. In the mid-mantle, seismic tomographic models reveal broad slow seismic wavespeed anomalies beneath the African craton,[20](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-20-84997)¬†commonly interpreted to be heat plume upwellings from the outer core.[21](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-21-84997)

**Building a Geographic Case for the SAC-LLVP Centroid**

However, in the interest of precision, let‚Äôs examine a more objective and recent (2021 tomographic) measure of the geographic position of the South Africa Cusp ‚Äì Large Low-Velocity-Shear Province (SAC-LLVP). In the extracted Exhibit G1 below, from the referenced Tsekhmistrenko, et al. 2021 study, one can observe the intersection of the cusp‚Äôs radial centroid and the 31¬∞ E Meridian.

> _The reader should note that, while the longitude of point 4 (green ball) on the chart shown in Exhibit G1 above is arguably the 31st East Meridian, the same one upon which Giza is located, there exists a range of latitude inside which a center of LLVP lower density might be assigned. The north-south placement could range from 8 to 18 degrees south latitude. We chose 104_¬∞_¬†(103.5_¬∞__¬†+‚ÅÑ‚àí¬†_1¬∞_¬†or¬†_13.5¬∞ South Latitude) for consistency in the specific scenario of conjecture here. As well, this angle corresponds to 90 degrees of cardinal rotation through Dzhanibekov effect, combined with a very reasonable and common 14 degrees of gross (not longitude dependent) magnetic pole variation (angle between core magnetic and rotational poles ‚Äì under the same definition convention used in celestial navigation). Thus, one should note that this in no way constitutes a petitio principii appeal._

Moreover, the center of LLVP mass‚Äîidentified as point 4 (green sphere) above‚Äîis geographically positioned at the apex of a proposed magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) core flux expulsion from the outer core into the Earth‚Äôs lower mantle, inside a 2015 study conducted by J. Tarduno, et al.[25](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-25-84997)¬†In this scenario, convective flows within the outer core, shaped by the thermal and compositional irregularities of the core‚Äìmantle boundary (CMB) beneath the African LLSVP (SAC-LLVP), reorganize the magnetic field‚Äîdisplacing it laterally and expelling flux from the region beneath southern Africa. This indicates a persistent, localized pattern of core dynamics over geologic timescales, implying that core‚Äìmantle coupling is not globally uniform but instead subject to spatial anisotropy and long-term structural influence.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Magnetodydrodynamic-flux-expulsion-1.png?resize=869%2C340&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Magnetodydrodynamic-flux-expulsion-1.png?ssl=1)

**Exhibit G2**¬†‚Äì Unified magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) core flux expulsion and SAC‚ÄìLLVP shear wave centroid charts from the cited Tarduno et al. study both converge on the same geographic location, marked by the green ball labeled ‚Äú4.‚Äù The red shaded areas in the Tarduno et al. study are further weighted by the South Africa Cusp Radial Center of Mass from the Tsekhmistrenko et al. study, shown in Exhibit G1 (green ‚Äú4‚Äù ball), to reflect density and depth concentrations.

The key inference drawn from the combined findings of the Tarduno and Tsekhmistrenko studies is this: magnetic flux expulsion events‚Äîsuch as those shown in Exhibit G2‚Äîmay coincide with, or even precede, exothermic transitions at depth, serving as early indicators of deeper thermal instabilities. Certain regions, such as the African SAC‚ÄìLLVP, may function as release valves or zones of mechanical, thermal, and magnetic decoupling. This area could represent a preferential site for pressure release or phase-change exsolution of material (e.g., iron, silicates, or volatiles), consistent with episodic mantle loading or basal heating.

The reader should note that, regarding the argument of a ‚Äòlack of recorded history‚Äô for such Dzhanibekov shifts, consider this: if the Earth‚Äôs geomagnetic core maintained its current orientation while a Dzhanibekov rotation occurred in the mantle and crust (Exhibit I below), such an event would be interpreted as a¬†geomagnetic pole excursion¬†in the field of paleomagnetism. This is due to our current methods of measurement. Over a prolonged period, we would not have the means to distinguish between a Dzhanibekov rotation and traditional geomagnetic pole shift (see note[26](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-26-84997)). Moreover, during a short Khafre-styled reversal of say 50 to 400 bitter cold, dark, and wet years, we might not be able to detect such a Dzhanibekov rotation at all, even in ice cores.

We posit therefore, that the centroid of the South Africa Cusp serves to act as the minimum gyroscopic-Dzhanibekov axis point during a decoupling of Earth‚Äôs mantle and core, serving to potentially rotate the Earth‚Äôs gyroscopic mass along a new geographic axis of Earth rotation (N_p_‚Äò), with the center of less-dense mass of the South Africa Cusp now pointing directly at the celestial North Pole (Polaris, Ursa Minor, etc.). The gyroscopic plane of higher mantle mass therefore would reside perpendicular to the LLVP axis, as depicted in Exhibits G1 and G2 above. The old geographic axis of Earth rotation (current ‚ÄòNorth Pole‚Äô) is also marked (N_p_).

**Key Georotational Principles**

The principle shown in Exibit H above is developed in terms of the physics of rotating bodies below. The special form of rotation proposed by this article, we call a Gyroscopically Mediated Dzhanibekov Rotation (last scenario on the right in Exhibit I below).

[![](https://i0.wp.com/theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Differing-Rotational-Principles-2.png?resize=869%2C331&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Differing-Rotational-Principles-2.png?ssl=1)

**Exhibit I ‚Äì Gyroscopically Mediated Dzhanibekov Rotation**¬†‚Äì not a retrograde rotation. What we postulate is a modified pure Dzhanibekov Effect rotation (Exhibit C), which does not complete fully ‚Äì being mediated by the gyroscopic effect of the differential mass planes between the LLVP less dense axis versus the more dense surrounding mantle. This more dense body serves as a form of gyroscopic wheel, forcing the Earths rotation to conserve momentum by taking on a gyroscopic stability priority, and neither a core-mantle coupled nor pure Dzhanibekov rotation. Note that the first two rotation concepts adhere to the ‚Äòright hand rule‚Äô of ‚ÄòArctic‚Äô polar definition. The latter two indicate the ‚Äòformer Arctic‚Äô in each scenario.

> _Key inference to be taken from the rightmost two images of Exhibit I above: The science of paleomagnetism possesses no method to detect a Dzhanibekov rotation, as distinct from a geomagnetic pole excursion or flip. So an appeal to ignorance here, is worthless._

Perhaps another way to understand our proposal is illustrated in Exhibit I2 below, which outlines the various possible types of georotational phenomena. We are specifically proposing the third scenario: one triggered by climate change (particularly oceanic heating), followed by scenario #2 (a ‚Äúgeomagnetic pole excursion‚Äù), cascading into a True Polar Wander event (#3) that relocates the georotational north pole (N_p_‚Äò) to southern Africa. The fourth scenario is included solely to clarify what we are not proposing‚Äîa tilt in axial obliquity. (Please note that ‚ÄúPolaris‚Äù means ‚Äì celestial north pole)

Now, let‚Äôs take the modified scenario at the right end of Exhibit I above, and arrange it into the graphic extracted from the Cottaar, Lekic, et. al study which we examined in Exhibit F earlier.

The sloughing of the D‚Äù layer acts as a lubricating mechanism between the core and the mantle, facilitating this process, much like applying duct tape to a ball of melting butter‚Äîit simply won‚Äôt adhere._  
  
Earth‚Äôs core remains in its same stable rotation, locked relative to the solar plane by the solar system‚Äôs A (the vector potential) and œï (the scalar potential) moments[31](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-31-84997)¬†‚Äì albeit bearing a weaker magnetic moment, and with a slightly lower total mass. The D‚Äù layer affords the disconnect between the mantle and core‚Äôs rotating masses. We address the combined mass of the mantle and crust (mesosphere, asthenosphere, and lithosphere) as the outer rotational body (ORB), for short. (It should be noted that we hold open the alternative possibility of a similar decoupling at the H-layer inside the mantle as well. Same principle of rotation applies however in both decoupling scenarios.)

Based on The Solution depicted in Exhibit J above, we consulted the NASA Earth Observatory Gravity Anomaly Maps and the Geoid (GRACE) reports repository, extracting the geoid image shown in Exhibit J2a below. I have added the elucidating annotations to this raw image. Our prediction of a Dzhanibekov three-moment problem, comprising Earth‚Äôs major moments and their axes, proved to be correct.[32](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-32-84997)

Below are the three moments (as depicted):

- **I‚ÇÅ (maximum inertia ‚Äì blue)**¬†is along the equatorial plane (widest point).
- **I‚ÇÇ (intermediate inertia ‚Äì red)**¬†is another equatorial axis perpendicular to I‚ÇÅ.
- **I‚ÇÉ (minimum inertia ‚Äì yellow)**¬†is the new polar axis (north-south rotation axis).

As the reader may notice below, a rotational geographic polar alignment along an axis passing through southern Africa fits a gyroscopic-equilibrium rotational model more cleanly than does our current rotational state, where a more massive I2¬†aligns with our rotational axis (a less-stable gyroscopic state). This sets up a high torsional or differential rotational stress as part of the physics inside our current state of rotation (Sate 1, outlined later in this article). Some means of State 1 capture, by means of geomagnetic field, is postulated in this article.

**Exhibit J2a ‚Äì NASA Earth Gravitational Model (EGM2008) ECDO Three-Moment Geoid Map**¬†‚Äì the three-moment Dzhanibekov-ECDO problem is both clearly outlined here, while our specific moment-axes predictions are confirmed by the mass-gravitational signatures detected by NASA. All annotations are added by this article‚Äôs author.

A history of this type of rotation we propose here, along with the precedent scientific study for this geophysical moment alternative approach to Earth‚Äôs rotational dynamics is outlined in Kirschvink, et al. 1997. Relevant conclusions from that study are cited below.

> Early to Middle Cambrian inertial interchange true polar wander event, during which Earth‚Äôs lithosphere and mantle rotated about 90 degrees in response to an unstable distribution of the planet‚Äôs moment of inertia.  
>   
> ‚Ä¶at least two tectonic plates, involving more than two-thirds of Earth‚Äôs continental lithosphere, were involved in a rapid rotation of ~90¬∞ relative to the spin axis. The new ages, along with paleomagnetic data, indicate that continents moved at rapid rates that are difficult to reconcile with our present understanding of mantle dynamics. A variant of this mechanism, inertial interchange true polar wander (IITPW), involves discrete bursts of TPW of up to 90¬∞ in geologically short intervals of time if the magnitudes of the intermediate and maximum moments of inertia cross.  
>   
> This would result in a¬†**_rapid movement away from the spin axis by the geographic location of the former pole with rotation of the entire solid Earth centered about the minimum moment of inertia_**¬†located on the equator. If the velocities are due to TPW, however, such geodynamical considerations are obviated because¬†_**the entire mantle would have rotated along with the lithosphere.**_

With ‚ÄòThe Solution‚Äô identified now in Exhibit J and confirmed by NASA geoid moments depicted in Exhibit J2a, forgive me, dear reader, as I must ask you to endure one more complex graphic. This graphic describes the entire set of physics behind the oscillation (repeating cycle) of Dzhanibekov rotation. Exhibit J2b below presents the pair of Earth rotational conditions and further outlines the physics involved in each state: Geomagnetic Priority and Gyroscopic Priority.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/The-Oscillation-Big-Picture-2.png?resize=869%2C536&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/The-Oscillation-Big-Picture-2.png?ssl=1)

**Exhibit J2b**¬†‚Äì The repeating cycle of core exothermic sloughing followed by subsequent endothermic accretion creates a repeating oscillation based on the variable strength of the geomagnetic moment of the Earth‚Äôs core (green annotation above). This process operates through the Dzhanibekov effect and the Earth‚Äôs mantle‚Äôs gyroscopic angular momentum. We speculate that the process of moving from State 2, Gyroscopic Priority, back to State 1, Geomagnetic Priority, may involve a viscoelastic-mantle tectonic height readjustment and¬†[gradual settle-in process](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Saudi-Flood-Google-Earth-b.png), however involving a relatively sudden cooling event at the point where the core recaptures its HCP-Fe lattice integrity.

**State 1: Geomagnetically Induced Mechanical Equilibrium (Core-Mantle Coupled)**

- Description: In this state, the gyroscope‚Äôs axis of spin is aligned with the applied magnetic field, and the weighted wheel is not rotating around the spin axis. The system is stable due to the magnetic forces, resulting in a balanced, equilibrium state. At the end of this cycle, the world heats (exothermic core) steadily before rotation to State 2.

**State 2: Conservation of Angular Momentum by Rotation Axis (Core-Mantle Decoupled)**

- Description: When the external magnet is removed, the gyroscope wheel returns to its plane of rotation (which has not changed in either State). In this state, the gyroscope conserves angular momentum through its true rotational axis (I3, see Exhibit J2 above), with the magnet decoupled, allowing the rotational motion to resume. The world grows cold (lattice-snaps to endothermic core) very fast. The Earth takes on a slower rotation speed since its more mass-dense axes are now positioned/extended at the new equator‚Äîpossibly slowing the Earth‚Äôs rotation to 360-day years.  
      
    (In the Rigveda and Surya Siddhanta it is mentioned that one year consists of 360 days which are split in 12 months of 30 days each. The Sumerians and later Babylonians used a 360-day year divided into 12 months of 30 days each. The early Egyptian civil calendar used a 360-day year, also divided into 12 months of 30 days. Only in Old Kingdom dynastic times did they add 5 ‚Äòepagomenal‚Äô days. The Maya Haab‚Äô calendar used a 360-day year (18 months of 20 days each), called the ‚Äútun‚Äù. The Avestan calendar, likely of Median origin, used a 360-day structure in its earliest form, with 12 months of 30 days. In ancient Hebrew and later apocalyptic literature (e.g., Revelation, Daniel), ‚Äútime, times, and half a time‚Äù equals 1,260 days = 3.5 years of 360 days each, suggesting symbolic or earlier usage.)

My hypothesis on how the Earth‚Äôs M-field is generated by the macro-alignment of the hexagonal close-packed anisotropic lattice c-axis microstructure in the inner core, and how disruptions in the plasmolid (plasma-solid) core can weaken or oblique the geomagnetic M-field, can be explored by¬†[clicking on this image](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/HCP-Axes-2.png). I originally developed this hypothesis in 2010 while leading an exotic materials research lab.

These two rotations (S1-to-S2 and S2-to-S1) and the sudden endothermic cold climate onset, reasonably fit the myth of P√∂q√°nghoya and Pal√∂ngawhoya, in¬†_The Book of Hopi_:

> _So again, as on the First World, S√≥tuknang called on the Ant People to open up their underground world for the chosen people. When they were safely underground, S√≥tuknang commanded the twins, P√∂q√°nghoya and Pal√∂ngawhoya, to leave their posts at the north and south ends of the world‚Äôs axis, where they were stationed to keep the earth properly rotating._
> 
> _The twins had hardly abandoned their stations when the world, with no one to control it, teetered off balance, spun around crazily, then rolled over twice. Mountains plunged into seas with a great splash, seas and lakes sloshed over the land; and as the world spun through cold and lifeless space it froze into solid ice._
> 
> ~¬†_The Book of Hopi_, Frank Waters

> Footnote on True Polar Wander and Khufu Alignment: Concerning the contention that a return from State 2 would not likely result in Khufu being aligned so precisely to true north upon resumption of State 1. Multiple dozens of global large-scale cardinally-aligned monuments‚Äîmost in fact‚Äîdo not agree with Khufu and Khafre as to ‚Äòtrue north‚Äô, however, they agree with each other‚Äîso what do we do with those monuments, toss them out in order to protect a fairy tale?[34](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-34-84997)  

This plausible (or arguably probable) oscillation, along with the mythic traditions of over 20 cultures, serve to broach the critical path question: Why does does such an event not show up in the paleomagnetic or ice core sample data?

**A Geologic Appeal to Ignorance? Maybe Not‚Ä¶**

[![](https://i0.wp.com/theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Lechamp-and-Iceland-Basin-Excursions.png?resize=806%2C852&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Lechamp-and-Iceland-Basin-Excursions.png?ssl=1)

**Figure 8**¬†‚Äì Laj and Lund Studies on Geomagentic Excursion Histories.

While researching this issue, I found that most paleogeomagnetic dipole moment studies unfortunately reside behind annual subscription paywalls. Nonetheless, I discovered that the typical temporal resolution of these studies is on the order of two to four thousand years at best.[35](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-35-84997)

Nonetheless, the bottom line is this: aside from the Leschamps excursion event 41,000 years ago, we lack strong differential data (unique from static measures) on the history of Earth‚Äôs dipole moment. However, what macro-scale data we do have links mass and large-fauna extinctions with dipole phenomena at the very least.

> _From what we know about field strength through time, over the last hundred thousand years, there does appear to be a linkage between extinctions and low geomagnetic field strength._
> 
> ~ James Channell, University of Florida Geologist, NPR[36](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-36-84997)

It is worthy to note however, that two recent geomagnetic excursions, the 41,000-year-old Laschamp Event (lower panel of Figure 8) and the up to 187,000-year-old Iceland Basin Excursion (upper panel of Figure 8) paleomagnetic core records, followed a Virtual Geomagnetic Pole (VGP) progression that conformed to the 31st Meridian polar shift conjectured in this article. See both progressions in Figure 8 from that study, to the right. Notice that both excursions followed the same geographic route, which was drawn to the SAC-LLVP Cusp as each event progressed, eventually reverting back to State 1 (clockwise) or to State 2 (counterclockwise)‚Äîboth along the 31st Meridian.[37](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-37-84997)¬†The Lund Study on the Laschamp and Iceland Basin Excursions shows¬†[similar pathway derivations](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Two-recent-geomagnetic-excursions.png)¬†to the Laj Study as well.[38](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-38-84997)

> _Note as well that the Laschamp excursion from State 1 to State 2 initiated with a change in geomagnetic pole geographic location, starting from Canada and moving into Russia, a pattern that also began for our modern era in 1973._

Finally, Craig Stone of nobulart.com has pointed out as well that such past geomagnetic pole excursion events have¬†[clustered on both the East and West Euler Axis Meridians](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Paleomagnetism-Continents-and-Oceans-McElhinny-McFadden-20002.png)¬†we identify immediately above (and in Exhibit E2 in particular).[39](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-39-84997)¬†This is not a coincidence as magnetic pole excursion trajectories adhere to ECDO proposed Euler Axis points geographically.

It is important to note that, under this hypothesis, the period during the shorter duration of State 2 does not constitute ‚Äòbusiness as usual, just upside down.‚Äô The pronounced volcanic activity and ocean displacement would make the world a cold, wet, and dark place during the intervening years of decoupled rotation. In other words, Greenland, Antarctic, and Lake Vostok ice cores and the resulting accelerated carbon-14 deposition rate may not clearly reflect the net impact of such a short and cold rotation period. I tend to place more inferential confidence in human myth with corroborating physical evidence to the presence (Euler Axis desert hashmarks), than in the mythological precision of a smoothed index suggesting an absence.

**Earth Bears the Euler Axis Hashmarks**

Finally, below is a short video illustrating the concept of the Mediated Dzhanibekov Oscillation between Geomagnetically Induced Mechanical Equilibrium (State 1) and Conservation of Angular Momentum by Rotation Axis (State 2). Special thanks to Craig Stone at¬†[nobulart.com](https://nobulart.com/)¬†for developing this video. Before proceeding to the next section, please pay particular attention to the location and celestial pole angles of the Great Pyramid at Giza depicted in the video.

**Exhibit J3**¬†‚Äì Mediated Dzhanibekov Oscillation with the rotational north axis cycling between 90¬∞ North (State 1) and 14¬∞ South (State 2) latitude (104 degrees) along the 31st East Meridian of longitude. The lever driving this cycle is the strength of the core‚Äôs magnetic moment. We currently rotate in State 1, with a strong-but-diminishing geomagnetic moment. The only thing in the video which differs from the hypothesis presented in this article is that the core of the Earth would not Dzhanibekov rotate with the outer rotational body (ORB = mantle + crust). It would continue to rotate as it does in State 1. This georotational concept was confirmed by¬†[Exhibit J2a above](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Three-Moment-Body-of-Earth.png).

The ECDO rotation shown in Exhibit J3 is consistent with the major oceanic-inundation desert formations across the globe, including the¬†[Gobi Desert](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Gobi-Desert.gif),¬†[American Southwest](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/American-Southwest-Desert.gif),¬†[Great Victoria Desert](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Great-Victoria-Desert.png),¬†[Patagonia](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Patagonia.png), and the¬†[Sahara Desert](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Sahara-Desert.gif).[40](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-40-84997)¬†[41](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-41-84997)¬†The Arabian Desert may well have occurred as the result of a settle-in process unique to the¬†[Arabian Tectonic Plate](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Arabian-Tectonic-Plate.png)¬†after or during return to State 1. Hence the seemingly more recent¬†[receding shorelines back to the Persian Gulf](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Saudi-Flood-Google-Earth-b.png).

**Exhibit J4 ‚Äì West and East Euler Axes**¬†‚Äì a violent 48 hours. The axis around which the Earth would temporarily rotate to shift the geographic North Pole to the new location (N_p_‚Äò). Indicated on the chart are the theoretical initial oceanic inertial velocities at original angular momentum and the resulting deserts and striations which would form from such an oceanic displacement. It is no coincidence that human, fauna, and flora genetic diversity is greatest at these two ‚Äòeye-of-the-hurricane‚Äô stability points (blue areas) during a 104¬∞ ECDO rotation from State 1 to State 2. Sub-Saharan Africa as well is partly spared due to its shielding by the North African continental mass and high deserts as well as its variances in land mass elevation. Special thanks again to Craig Stone at nobulart.com for developing this image (click image to expand).

Moreover, the ‚ÄòEast and West Euler Axis Mundi‚Äô (demarcated by the green arrow vector in Exhibit J3 and yellow/red ‚äï symbols in Exhibit J4) are the points at (0¬∞, 121¬∞E) and (0¬∞, 59¬∞W) respectively, representing the axis around which the Earth would temporarily rotate to shift the geographic North Pole to the new location (Np‚Äò) at 31¬∞E, 14¬∞S. This terminology aligns with the concept of Euler‚Äôs rotation theorem,[42](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-42-84997)¬†describing the temporary orthogonal axis of rotation for this specific geophysical event. Deserts formed from oceanic displacement, along with the terrestrial striations from this kinetic event, cleanly match both poles of the Euler Axis Mundi.

One should note that the optimal location for inundation-survival in the Western Hemisphere under this scenario, would be the¬†[Ecuadoran and Peruvian Andes](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Peru-and-Ecuador.png), along the coast just west of the Euler Axis in South America. From the perspective of the East Euler Axis, a similar location for survival of such an event would reside at¬†[Sulawesi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulawesi)¬†and¬†[Gunung Padang, Indonesia](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Gunung-Padang.png).

Perhaps this is the reason why the¬†[oldest cave art in the world](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sulawesi-Indonesia-oldest-cave-art.png)¬†(51,200 years old) can only be found at Leang Bulusipang, Sulawesi[43](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-43-84997)¬†‚Äì which is a cave at an altitude of 1800 feet positioned right on the East Euler Axis.

Perhaps as well, this is why we find Mankind‚Äôs oldest surviving genetic components, originating near the East Euler Axis in the forms of¬†_[homo floresiensis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_floresiensis)_, the¬†[extraordinary genetic distribution of Indonesia](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Genetic-Distribution-in-Indonesia.png), along with our most ancient genetics in the Papuan, Austronesian,¬†[Orang Asli (Semang), and Andamanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Australians)¬†Aborigines. Ample and recent genetic study using mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome data, such as those published in¬†_Nature Genetics_,¬†_American Journal of Human Genetics_,¬†_Investigative Genetics_, and¬†_Nature_, have shown that Indonesian populations are among the most genetically diverse in the world. Finally, these genetic clusters show clear¬†[association with the most ancient Amazonian tribes](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Two-Genetic-Clusters-at-Euler-Points-Related.png)¬†existing along the West Euler Axis as well.

> _Notwithstanding the environment of Sub-Saharan Africa which was shielded by the Saharan high desert, these two Euler Axis locations are¬†**the**¬†most genetically diverse (across all species) locations on the planet. We believe this to be no coincidence._

**Exhibit J5 ‚Äì Desert versus Biodiversity**¬†‚Äì The biodiversity model confirms the survival points at each Euler Axis geographic location, complemented by regions of the African continent that were shielded from inundation by the landmass now known as the Sahara desert. Genetic diversity in these areas is both strikingly varied and ancient when compared to the rest of the Earth. The two oceanic displacements marked with a ‚ÄòB‚Äô are proposed post-rotation back-flows. This georotational prediction was confirmed by¬†[Exhibit J2a above](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Three-Moment-Body-of-Earth.png).

Amazingly, according to a study by P. Skoglund, et al. ‚ÄúTwo Founding Populations of the Americas‚Äù (Nature, 2016),[44](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-44-84997)¬†as well as Graham Hancock in Episode 2 of Season 2 of his¬†[Ancient Apocalypse](https://www.netflix.com/title/81211003)¬†series, humans at both Euler Axes depicted in Exhibit J5 bear the same common genetic signatures that the rest of humanity does not share.

Indeed, Zeng, et al. ‚ÄúNeolithic Y-chromosome Bottleneck‚Äù (Nat Commun, 2018) cites a 20 to 1 reduction (bottleneck) in human Y-DNA genetic diversity, sometime between 3,000 to 5,000¬†`BCE`.[45](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-45-84997)¬†[46](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-46-84997)¬†Despite all the pretend science, hyperbole, and wishful thinking, no disease, famine, cultural or conquest practice, war, or cosmic impact could possibly account for the ubiquitous nature of the effect outlined in Exhibit J6 below. While various circumstances could possibly explain a small subset population exhibiting such a DNA contrast, none can account for the global distribution of the phenomenon described below‚Äîsave one.

> _Only a quasi-anticipated global inundation (or two such events from 13,000 to 4000¬†`BCE`¬†as indicated below) could account for this DNA progression observed in the male Y chromosome._

[![](https://i0.wp.com/theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/y-dna-to-mt-dna-contrast.png?resize=708%2C324&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/y-dna-to-mt-dna-contrast.png?ssl=1)

**Exhibit J6**¬†‚Äì 19 in 20 genetic males were culled between 3,000 to 5,000¬†`BCE`¬†(Zeng, et al.), yet this pattern does not replicate in mtDNA (female) progressions (Karmin, et al.). There is only one plausible explanation for this as a global phenomenon: an anticipated cataclysm, during which a single male lineage preserved its household‚Äîalong with a variety of female captives, servants, slaves, and concubines.[47](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-47-84997)¬†It is important to note that the Zeng et al. study does not concur with the luxurious 10 ky decline depicted above (this would involve a solely genetic cause, as well as a set of plainly evident and confirmational allele makers), and instead attributes the majority of this drop as occurring between 3000 to 5000¬†`BCE`. We tentatively match this to our provision timeline date of 4400¬†`BCE`¬†for the ‚ÄòFlood of Noah‚Äô.

The chart in Exhibit J6 above (brought to my attention by Ben Davidson, Founder of SpaceWeatherNews) shows the compression in human regional populations (ergo DNA as well) that occurred at this time, also indicating that the Caucus and Africa regions were spared from the total brunt of this calamitous event (due to the ‚ÄòSub-Saharan Shield‚Äô as shown in Exhibit J5 above), while Europe and Southeast Asia populations rebounded quickly thereafter, having not been salted by the oceanic inundation (see Exhibit J7 below).[48](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-48-84997)¬†Couple this with the fact that the surviving ancient human genetic signatures are shared exclusively at each Euler axis and coincides, both geographically and temporally, with peaks in animal and plant genetic diversity, and you hold precisely the kind of extraordinary evidence Carl Sagan once championed.

Finally, if one surveys the location and density of salt infused land globally, this geographic distribution conforms to the same predictions we have made inside this hypothesis.

Finally, confirmation of the 104¬∞ true polar wander, the linchpin of this hypothesis, can be found by examining the azimuth differential contained in ancient stone¬†[circles and monuments](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Confirmation.png).

**Exhibit J8**¬†‚Äì the oldest known stone circles in Britain, the oldest dating to the fourth century¬†`BCE`¬†‚Äì both feature critical alignment (326¬∞/146¬∞ T) to N_p_‚Äò as it is defined in this ECDO hypothesis (geographic location of the postulated 104¬∞ true polar wander).

As one may observe in Exhibit J8 above, the earliest known large circular enclosure in Britain, The Flagstones in Dorchester, England, dating from around 3200¬†`BCE`¬†(site activity began 3960 ‚Äì 3400¬†`BCE`), bears a¬†[marked antipode axis (_a_-N_p_‚Äò) of 326¬∞/146¬∞ relative to true north](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/The-Flagstones-Monument1.png), which corresponds to the geographic location of N_p_‚Äò in this hypothesis. Its sister site, just a couple hundred meters to the east, the Mount Pleasant Henge (2870¬†`BCE`), is also critically based upon a¬†[326¬∞/146¬∞ True alignment and orientation](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/The-Flagstones-Monument-Mount-Pleasant-Henge-2.png)¬†(aligned to N_p_‚Äò) as well.[51](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-51-84997)¬†[52](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-52-84997)

As a side note, while a¬†[detailed study of Stonehenge 1](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/The-Flagstones-Monument-Stonehenge-1.png)¬†does not reveal a clean match to the requisite 147¬∞ T bearing (for its geographic location) to N_p_‚Äò, its study is a fascinating exercise unto itself. The original Stonehenge ‚Äì 1, dating to 3100¬†`BCE`, is really a 56 Aubrey segment, 224 degree, 3-Saros cycle, Moon circle, with a Sun circle superimposed upon it.

**Exhibit J9**¬†‚Äì contrary to the official Narrative, the passage inside the Newgrange monument in County Meath, Ireland is not aligned to the rising of the sun at the winter solstice. It is aligned to N`_p_`‚Äò in the ECDO Hypothesis.[53](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-53-84997)¬†[54](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-54-84997)

In Exhibit J9 above, one can see that the main passage of the Newgrange monument (3200¬†`BCE`) clearly is not aligned with the rising sun for the winter solstice. It is aligned with N`_p_`‚Äò inside this hypothesis.

Similarly, the Nazca Lines in Peru are organized around a primary focal axis, to which all other glyphs are oriented, precisely matching the azimuth of N_p_‚Ä≤ during Earth‚Äôs State 2 rotation.

**Exhibits J10, J11, and J12**¬†‚Äì The Primary Axis of the Nazca Lines aligns precisely with the location of N_p_‚Ä≤ during the State 2 rotation period, as described in ECDO theory. This is not a case of selectively cherry picking one of the more trivial lines, but rather a direct azimuthal (107.9¬∞ True) correspondence to the¬†_**principal line**_¬†(blue area highlight in Exhibit J12) that governs the orientation of the entire Nazca glyph array.

Finally, possibly the earliest known spiral depiction on European soil‚Äîfound at the Maltese Hagar Qim Temple from the Ggantija period (3600‚Äì3200 BCE)‚Äîis shown in Exhibit J10 below.[55](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-55-84997)¬†This early use of the spiral motif likely provides insight into the purpose of these ubiquitous symbols found throughout Scotland, Ireland, and the rest of Europe. The left side of the carving represents the sky‚Äôs rotation around the north celestial pole in State 1, while the right side depicts the same star field‚Äôs rotation in State 2. The chiseled dots within the motif were not arbitrary; they symbolized stars in the northern sky.

**Exhibit J10**¬†‚Äì the earliest spirals from Malta‚Äôs Hagar Qim Temple of the Ggantija period (3600‚Äì3200 BCE) convey their message far more clearly than the generations of spirals that followed across Europe.

The reader should notice that the relative elevation of the north celestial pole above the horizon appears to be the same for both States 1 and 2 in Exhibit J10 above. This would indeed have been the case for Malta, as it bisects the 104¬∞ shift proposed by this ECDO hypothesis (see Exhibit J3). To this author, this first spiral stone, stands as the meaning behind the more fanciful depictions that followed thereafter.

However, no monument better aligns with and corroborates this postulate than the Great Pyramid of Giza, also known as the Khufu pyramid‚Äîthe unrivaled king of all ancient monuments.

Note that the Black Sun symbol could be interpreted to suggest a decoupling at the H-layer instead of the D‚Äù layer as we propose in this article.

**Image 4 ‚Äì Back of Coin Matched to Antarctic Door Symbol**¬†‚Äì Symbol also found by Spartan 1 in Antarctic ‚ÄòOctagon.‚Äô Top coin found in Mexico in 1993. Bottom coin found by metal hunter in Mulberry, Florida in 2024. This was a widespread program.

The back of the coin shown on the left side of Image 2 above is stamped with a radial diagram divided into 12 and then 24 segments in radial progression (Image 4 to the right). That radial pattern is recreated in Image 3 above. If we recreate this symbol according to even proportions, the symbol matches the radius proportion of the Earth‚Äôs core in relation to its entire body. While the hypothesis below does not depend upon this observation, it is certainly intriguing.

To further compound the mystery of this coin, a second example was discovered in 2024 by metal detectorist Timothy S. Kelly in a field near Mulberry, Florida.[57](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-57-84997)¬†A third coin, reported by another participant in the same discussion thread, can be seen in¬†[this image](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Seal-Team-Mana-Condy-coin-find2.png). While the coin could conceivably have been a promotional item from some long-forgotten campaign, these artifacts were not machine-made. Who would invest such significant artisan labor and non-gold metal resources into what would amount to a child‚Äôs trinket or meaningless bauble?

Though the coins shown in the top and bottom panels of Image 4 are not the same individual specimen, they were clearly struck from the same die. One can therefore reasonably speculate that a broader program may have been underway at the time these coins were produced‚Äîone involving a Khufu-like pyramid and a curious focus on the relationship between Earth‚Äôs core and mantle. A rather sophisticated level of design, expense, and geographic footprint for what would have to be a multi-decade and exorbitantly costly hoax. At first assessment, these ‚Äòcoins‚Äô appear to have been worn as a form of identity or functional-role badge‚Äîstrikingly similar to the¬†[TƒÉrtƒÉria amulet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C4%83rt%C4%83ria_tablets), believed to have been cast and worn as a necklace around 5500¬†`BCE`, during the so-called Golden Age of the then-ruling god Saturn (Cronus).

Perhaps the additional symbol found by Spartan 1 on the same 20 ft door in the Antarctic Octagon (upper right panel of Image 4) was suggesting a shift in the positional relationship between the core and its mantle? Possibly the core reversing its relative motion with the mantle as of late indicates that someone (I make no conjecture as to ‚Äòwho‚Äô) is achieving success?[58](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-58-84997)

Nonetheless, something of this nature was being communicated by the markings on the Nubian Egg. The etching strikes were deliberate and related the three pyramids to the sky in some manner.

Returning to our critical path, scientist and amateur investigator alike have long wondered why the Khufu Pyramid has been positioned so tantalizingly close to the center of Earth‚Äôs landmasses[59](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-59-84997)¬†and the 30th North Parallel (reader please be aware that, in the vernacular of celestial navigation, a latitude is called a ‚Äòparallel‚Äô and a longitude is a ‚Äòmeridian‚Äô). Khufu‚Äôs positioning so as to inherit its location at the nominal 31st East Meridian is of course simply a matter of Greenwich, England having been selected as the demarcation point for the Prime Meridian, so that was deliberate.

However, Khufu‚Äôs specific positioning at the very longitude which just happens to also be named the 31st East Meridian is not an accident, in that this meridian is the very line of progression between the current North Pole (N_p_) and the proposed alternative SAC-LLVP based North Pole (N_p_‚Äò) ‚Äì anchored upon the axis of gyroscopic dynamics depicted in Exhibits F, I, and J above.

This is not accidental. Neither are these shafts purposed for air supply or spotting specific stars. It is our conjecture that the three chambers of the Khufu Pyramid were designed to house sophisticated sensors used to monitor the Earth‚Äôs rotational stability. This same motif was found¬†[marked on the top right hand side](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Markings-on-Anomalous-Antarctica-Door.png)¬†of a 20 ft tall door to an anomalous octagonal structure purportedly found in Antarctica by a Navy Seal Team, Spartan 1, in 2003.[63](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-63-84997)¬†We speculate (note: not critical path to the hypothesis) that this was a tripartite observatory:

**Exhibit K3**¬†‚Äì Earth‚Äôs Celestial North Pole Nutation (Wobble and Wander). As the Earth‚Äôs geomagnetic moment weakens, nutation of the celestial pole dilates and global ocean temperatures rise rapidly. True Polar Wander initiates from the noise detected herein.

**1. King‚Äôs Chamber ‚Äì Celestial True Polar Wander Monitoring:**¬†The north celestial pole monitoring shafts are oriented to a specific celestial reference, running directly to the pyramid‚Äôs surface and pointing accurately at both Np (State 1 Geographic North Pole) and Np‚Äò (State 2 Geographic North Pole) for Giza. These shafts are designed to monitor both the True Polar Wander, as well as the Nutation (wobble and wander) of the celestial north pole (see Exhibit K3 to the right). The reader should note that, while we discuss true polar wander in the context of this article, both TPW and Nutation can be monitored simultaneously by this aspect of the device.

Since the North Shaft from the King‚Äôs Chamber makes a mid-shaft break to the west to avoid some structure (similar to the North Shaft from the Queen‚Äôs Chamber), it cannot be used for direct optical observation, as is often conjectured. Instead, this would be a monitoring device requiring termination at the pyramid‚Äôs surface, facing directly at the celestial north pole.

We postulate (though not critical to the hypothesis) that a gravitational sled operated in the Grand Gallery, moving a mechanism in the King‚Äôs Chamber involved in powering the entire structure. The linear sliding scars on the side benches indicate that a sled indeed operated in the Grand Gallery.[64](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-64-84997)¬†The gallery was not used for lifting stones for the pyramid or the King‚Äôs Chamber, as it did not extend far enough to address the loft problem in any application context. In other words, getting an 80-ton stone to the Grand Gallery is a more daunting task than using the Grand Gallery to lift it a mere 21 additional meters. A monumental and complex structure (made of 5 to 16-ton stones itself) to provide a minor benefit for just a handful of stones, which is accomplished everywhere else without comment or pyramid alteration. Any compounding to multiply the sled distance moved would have required as monumental an assembly as the gallery itself. Instead, the design of the Grand Gallery was clearly one of a closed gravitational potential energy system‚Äîmuch like a weight-powered grandfather clock.

The granite used for the floor, walls, and ceiling of the King‚Äôs Chamber, as well as for the successive ceilings of its stress-relieving chambers, is a good conductor of heat. Its use in these components of the broader chamber structure could help dissipate heat away, and rising vertically up, from the King‚Äôs Chamber‚Äîif this indeed was the center of power generation and distribution for all three high-amperage sensor components. The limestone walls of the relieving chambers would not be a particularly good conductor of heat in comparison (1.3 to 2.4 W/m¬∑K), so this construction would have acted much like a heat-chimney of sorts. Some researchers have noted that the granite beams in the King‚Äôs Chamber exhibit unusual discoloration, which could suggest exposure to chronic high temperatures (per Christopher Dunn‚Äôs work on ‚ÄúThe Giza Power Plant‚Äù).[65](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-65-84997)¬†Here again, however, our hypothesis is not critically founded upon such conjecture.

Such a power core would need to be functionally located away and off-axis from our next sensor component located in the Queen‚Äôs Chamber.

The limestone blocks of the pyramid served as a natural isolation mechanism, insulating the copper cables and shielding them from extraneous electromagnetic interference, while simultaneously allowing transparency to the critical Earth geomagnetic frequencies essential to the mission. The 90-degree relative angle to the pyramid‚Äôs sky-facing sides (no accident ‚Äì annotated as the right angle in Exhibit K) might have been designed to focus and channel electromagnetic resonances, enhancing the sensitivity and accuracy of the geomagnetic monitoring system in the Queen‚Äôs Chamber. This was arguably an ionospheric-monitoring antenna. The following applies:

Hence the 104-degree spread of the antenna‚Äôs ‚ÄòV‚Äô. The north shaft was altered as the structure was built, to more align with geomagnetic north for Giza (annotated as ‚Äòvariation‚Äô in the Top-Down View).

Remnants of the copper cables (click on photo to right) were found by the Gantenbrink Upuaut Project in March 1990 in the Queen‚Äôs Chamber south air shaft (and later the North Shaft as well). These cables have long since been removed by both tomb robbers, as evidenced by the Dixon Relics found by Waynman Dixon at the bottom of the north shaft in 1872, and by obfuscation (alleged) on the part of Zahi Hawass. As one can see in this¬†[linked image of the door cables](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Removed-portion-of-right-cable-South-Queens-Shaft.png), Hawass had the right hand cable¬†[removed by the door pressure testing](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Cable-broken-off-by-pressure-test2.png)¬†team during the Djedi Project (Hawass knew¬†_exactly_¬†what he needed to hide/steal‚Äîthis constituted theft of mankind‚Äôs intellectual property). They then proceeded without comment regarding the sudden change, and no trace of the copper cable remnant was ever admitted by the research team‚Äîwhile no outcry from the archaeological community was ever raised. This is a prime example of why I have little respect for archaeology.

Below, the reader will lay witness to the reasons behind why Hawass (allegedly) knew these copper cables had to be confiscated and their documentation prevented‚Äîthese copper cables will never show up again. In 2014, the former Egyptian Minister of Antiquities, archaeologist Zahi Hawass was charged with stealing Egyptian antiquities.[68](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-68-84997)¬†In the list of items allegedly stolen by Hawass, the most unusual artifact was the ancient ‚Äúcopper wires from the Pyramid of Cheops (Khufu).‚Äù ~ YouTube: ‚ÄúNew Discovery Inside the Great Pyramid! What Did Scientists Find?‚Äù; 20 Apr 2023;[69](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-69-84997)

> _In 2014, the former Egyptian Minister of Antiquities, archaeologist Zahi Hawass was charged with stealing Egyptian antiquities. In the [manifest] of items [allegedly] stolen by [Hawass], the most unusual artifact was the ancient copper wires from the Pyramid of Cheops._¬†~ Riddle, VineMontana TV

The video containing record of this allegation of copper cable theft can be seen by¬†[clicking here](https://videos.files.wordpress.com/7usZbOjL/zahi-hawass-stolen-copper-cables-video.mp4). After Egyptian authorities and Hawass cut a deal regarding his improprieties, the internet was scrubbed of any manifest of such items. The manifest of items allegedly stolen and relevant court records are sealed. Thus, I had to obtain the video linked above from the Wayback Machine.

Despite this, one of the copper cable segments was still¬†[found 5 meters down the shaft](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Copper-cable-remnant.png), laying on the floor, having been pulled free from the end stone by applied force long ago.[70](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-70-84997)

In Exhibit K2b below, a longitudinal cross section drawing is depicted as to how we surmised the cables were affixed into the shaft end stone. This anchoring method prevented the cables from either pushing through or pulling out from the stone during expansion (heating with active current) and contraction (when inactive) respectively.

In addition, based upon copper decay rates using classic oxidation, carbonation, and acid erosion conventions, in a 20% humidity, 1000 ppm carbon dioxide enclosed limestone chamber ‚Äì the hanging copper cable segment depicted in the image to the upper right, would have taken¬†[8,300 to 12,500 years](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Copper-Decay-in-Khufu.png)¬†to decay to the 50th percentile taper it exhibits in the image. This matches the 9,600¬†`BCE`¬†dating of the star chart chiseled into the Queen‚Äôs Chamber south air shaft ‚Äòpenultimate stone‚Äô ceiling that is analyzed later in this article. Therefore, there is no possible way this copper dates from the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt. A proper corrosion product analysis and chronological profiling study should have been conducted on this copper immediately upon its supposed ‚Äòsampling‚Äô‚Äîand yet, no such study will ever will be conducted.

**Exhibit K2b**¬†‚Äì Longitudinal cross section of shaft end door and expansion/contraction anchoring, dovetailing, and stopping.

As one can observe in the photo above and in Exhibit K2b, there are two copper components that extend out of the stone face: first is a dovetail mold of copper cut into the stone itself to keep the end of the wire anchored and prevent it from being pulled too taut out the back of the stone, and second, the cable itself, now hanging over the dovetail mold of the right cable. The same dangling cables and dovetailed anchors can be observed on the¬†[North Shaft stone](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Both-Queens-Shafts-North-Shaft-Block.png)¬†as well. One can observe where the dovetail-molded copper fitting has fallen out and the copper cable hangs in its place in this¬†[closeup of the North Shaft left cable](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Both-Queens-Shafts-North-Shaft-Block-close-2.png). In this anchoring design the copper cables can neither be pulled out of the stone, nor can they be pulled too taught through the stone itself. The cables are anchored through the stone in both directions‚Äîan engineering solution befitting a precision-engineered critical component and not a decorative or one-time functional feature in the least.

If these fittings were merely intended to bear stone load, they would have been made of cheaper and stronger bronze, not soft copper. Additionally, they were not designed to prevent the stone from being removed, as a stone-cut bevel across the entire face of the stone would have been much more effective and easier to craft. As one can see with the cable on the right, the run of copper extended far beyond the anchoring dovetail on the face of the stone. Therefore, the copper cable did not end as a dovetail on this stone face. This cable end-piece remained in place until the Djedi Project drilled through the door and caused it to dislodge in 2011.

> _The deductive key to understanding the shaft-door copper fittings lies here: a dovetail cut-mold is unnecessary for a one-time-use function, such as lowering handles or mere decoration. These cuts are used to affix or anchor a component that is intended to endure repeated or long-term dynamic stress. They secure a metal component expected to expand and contract under varying heat and/or amperage conditions. This stone and copper contraption was not incidental‚Äîit was engineered with a specific function in mind._

We note that newer, patina-free, and finely-hewn limestone blocks were used for the final 10 meters of the north shaft‚Äôs ceiling. Prior to this section, the shaft is composed of older stones with a dark patina, which has been scratched by several previous¬†[metal rod investigation attempts](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Patina.png). Similar to the Queen‚Äôs south air shaft, this shaft appears to have been constructed in stages, separated by a significant amount of time.[71](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-71-84997)¬†There remains inference to be drawn from this deductive evidence, if archaeology would pause from its confirmation bias of the ‚Äòburial chamber‚Äô narrative and focus on thoroughly investigating these findings. Simply taking photographs and exclaiming, ‚ÄúWell isn‚Äôt that a mystery‚Ä¶‚Äù is not science.

This research demonstrates that the Pyramid resonates with radio frequency waves, specifically within the 200‚Äì600 meter wavelength range [.5 to 1.5 MHz], activating its dipole and quadrupole moments. As a result, the Pyramid acts as a natural antenna capable of concentrating [or receiving] electromagnetic energy, potentially influencing[/monitoring] the Earth‚Äôs ionosphere or other environmental electromagnetic fields (courtesy of @pshs04 on X).[76](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-76-84997)_

He demonstrates that the SAR-Doppler technique (as validation) accurately framed the existing known chambers inside the Giza complex. The ‚Äòsyringes‚Äô (blue columns) the tomography identified were cited by Greek historian Ammianus Marcellinus in his work, Res Gestae 22.15.30.[77](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-77-84997)

[![](https://i0.wp.com/theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Shunt-Coil-Heat-Shaft-1.png?resize=598%2C491&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Shunt-Coil-Heat-Shaft-1.png?ssl=1)

This functionality was feasible particularly if the system‚Äôs active power was controlled and frequency-tuned by a horizontal and perpendicular-to-field shunt coil, cooled (high amperage) by its extension into the eastward horizontal passage of the chamber‚Äôs eastward-facing niche, whereby the limestone block heat transfer efficiency would keep the overall temperature of the Queen‚Äôs Chamber at a reasonable level. For predictive confirmation, we therefore examined the condition of the limestone just outside and above the south passage, and indeed this is what we find.

[The burnt limestone](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Burnt-limestone-heat-escaping-Queens-Chamber-Niche.png)¬†above and exiting the Queen‚Äôs Chamber niche, continuing to the ceiling of the Queen‚Äôs Chamber itself, also aggregated near the niche and dissipating across the ceiling ridge moving westward, confirms the presence of high heat in antiquity. The surface of heated limestone can undergo thermal decomposition and partial melting, resulting in a dark brown colored vitrification with a glossy appearance (see Exhibit K2c below).[78](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-78-84997)¬†This heat was not from fire, because the vitrified patina contains no bound combustion ash or chemical reaction residues. This dark brown ‚Äòleoparding‚Äô (my term) is due to the release of carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) and the presence of impurities in the limestone that can change color upon exposure to high heat.

As well, the ‚Äòmelting streaks‚Äô inside the stone directly¬†[over the mouth of the niche passage](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Leoparding-and-Quick-Lime-Decay.png)¬†come from the higher heat decay of softer limestone into ‚Äòquick lime.‚Äô[79](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-79-84997)

The users of this power did not fully grasp the utility of voltage (Ohm‚Äôs Law:¬†_V = IR_), and therefore had no need for transferring this power over long distances (which would have required high voltage). Consequently, the power was high amperage, high resistance, and was used for a nearby demand. Those who generate power for distant applications seek to minimize resistance and heat at all costs. In this application, the users were not concerned about power transmission over a distance. This power was utilized directly within the pyramid itself.

_Yes the Pyramid was a power plant, but this high-amperage/high-heat/low-voltage  
power could only be used inside the structure itself.

**Exhibit K2c ‚Äì High, non-combustion generated, heat**¬†‚Äì Notice that the highest temperature (quick lime) decay is located right at the exit of the horizontal passage, transitioning to lower temperature vitrification of limestone impurities (leoparding) as the heat dissipates while rising to the top of the niche. This indicates an extraordinary level of heat exposure, which was not caused by chemical reaction or combustion.

**3. Subterranean Chamber ‚Äì D‚Äù layer P-Wave Infrasound Monitoring:**¬†Deep-earth seismometry/core-mantle D‚Äù layer/LLVP dynamics monitoring fluid-based sensor. In similar effect to the geomagnetic monitoring, the pyramid‚Äôs structure could have been optimized to both isolate and focus seismic signals towards the Subterranean Chamber, allowing it to effectively monitor seismic activity and internal Earth dynamics free of noise from surface, device, or other nearby activity. The chamber itself would use water to detect the infrasound frequencies involved.[80](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-80-84997)

Moreover, there is an independent determination that the rock-cut¬†[dead-end south passage](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Subterranean-Chamber-Horizontal-Passage-Marine-Silt-Deposition.png)¬†inside the chamber might well have functioned as a sound resonance tube, generating or receiving infrasound with a base frequency in the range of 5 and 10 Hz ‚Äì and that constant low frequency noise can be heard/sensed in the chamber.[81](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-81-84997)¬†[82](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-82-84997)¬†This corresponds well to the design of the pyramid itself ‚Äì which is wavelength optimized to 5 Hz, per Exhibit K3 below.

**Understanding the Necessity of The Great Pyramid‚Äôs Scale  
Why Did They Bury a Water-Eroded Chamber so Far Below It?

**Exhibit K3**¬†‚Äì Infrasound featuring wavelengths in the range of 30 to 70 meters (Earth P-waves), suitable for propagation from the D‚Äù layer up to the Earth‚Äôs surface[83](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-83-84997)¬†[84](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-84-84997)¬†[85](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-85-84997)¬†would reflect inside the pyramid in much the same fashion as occurs in a microphone‚Äôs parabolic reflector. The focal point for such infrasound coincides with the location of the Subterranean Chamber. The 5 to 10 Hz range is quite reasonable for detecting infrasound signals emanating from deep within the Earth, including potential core noise.

This also describes why the scale of the Great Pyramid was critical to its function. If the pyramid‚Äôs slope angle were reduced, the fluid-filled[86](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-86-84997)¬†chamber would need to be placed deeper into the Earth. Conversely, if the slope were too steep, the structure would risk collapse and costs would increase non-linearly. If the structure had smaller dimensions, it would not have effectively concentrated the wavelengths involved. Therefore, the design aimed to optimize the balance between the side slope, depth of the Subterranean Chamber, and overall instrument effectiveness. With the exception of Khafre, all other pyramids were cargo cult imitations, displaying a lack of awareness of Khufu‚Äôs critical feature functionalities.

It is possible that the Subterranean Chamber was once filled with mercury, which has been found in trace amounts across the Giza Plateau and the Khufu Pyramid itself, as well as extensively beneath the Teotihuacan pyramids in Mexico and in the tomb of China‚Äôs first emperor, Qin Shi Huang.[87](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-87-84997)¬†Mercury would have offered several advantages as a sensing medium:

- Effective encapsulation through amalgamation with limestone, preventing leaching.
- Extreme sensitivity to core D‚Äù layer P-wave signals reflected by the pyramid‚Äôs architecture.
- The ability to carry a sustained direct current, modulated by subtle P-wave vibrations.
- Direct delivery of the modulated DC current into a monitoring system, without the need for additional detection devices like hydrophones, geophones, or vibrometers.

Naturally, mercury would not be employed trivially in any context, and we speculate that no specific feature of the Khufu Pyramid was without purpose. As explored in the following section, just as the offset of the King‚Äôs Chamber may serve as an authentication technique, so too does the offset of the Subterranean Chamber appear to have a distinct purpose (Exhibit K4 below).

[![](https://i0.wp.com/theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Chart-3b-Infrasound-Bias-Chart-1.png?resize=869%2C567&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Chart-3b-Infrasound-Bias-Chart-1.png?ssl=1)

**Exhibit K4 ‚Äì The Subterranean Chamber 9¬∞ South Offset**¬†‚Äì to align its listening vector with the Earth‚Äôs inner core surface, specifically beneath the South African 104¬∞ cusp identified earlier in this article. The 8- and 9-degree offsets of both the King‚Äôs and Subterranean Chambers were no accident; they served a deliberate technological purpose.

In summary, the combined observation of the celestial pole‚Äôs short term nutation dynamics, the strength, asymmetry, and orientation of the Earth‚Äôs magnetic moment, and D‚Äù layer/LLVP seismic noise amplified by the pyramid, monitored from the Subterranean Chamber, could have formed a dynamic integrated system. The pyramid‚Äôs shape itself acted as a kind of receiving cone, pointing down into the Earth, enhancing those monitoring capabilities. This system would allow for more accurate inferences if all three components showed simultaneous anomalous signals, indicating onset of a significant geophysical event.

This integrated system is mounted upon the¬†[original bedrock shelf](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Khufu_right_profile-580738042.png)¬†which underlies only the ‚Äòobservatory‚Äô footprint of the pyramid, and not the entire edifice. Together, these chambers composed an advanced monitoring system that may have allowed an unknown party, possibly the mythical Anunnaki themselves, to predict significant geological and rotational events, such as the coming deluge. An event they all took an oath to conceal from mankind.[88](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-88-84997)

To those who resent that our suggestion of such a core dynamics technology also might imply the presence of ancient aliens, I would say this: I don‚Äôt care. In our second article we make it clear that the evidence supports the contention that humans built the pyramids. In contrast, what we have venerated as science to date regarding the purpose of Khufu constitutes a ridiculous children‚Äôs fairy tale. Most of humanity is weary of being insulted and gaslighted over this edifice.

**Exhibit H2**¬†‚Äì Both the Geographic Center of the World at the 38th North parallel, as well as the Giza Complex at the 30th North parallel are depicted in relation to each other and the Np to Np‚Äô meridian of Dzhanibekov rotation.

However, it is clear to us that the two sets of shafts serve a dual purpose, not just one. In the image shown in Exhibit K above, regarding the ‚Äòair/star shafts‚Äô which run outward and up at specific angles from each of the King and Queen‚Äôs Chambers, one pair of these shafts points directly north, while the other points directly south. Such precision in alignment suggests a purpose beyond mere ventilation, as the substantial cost and engineering effort involved in these particular designs would be unjustifiable for simple air shafts ‚Äì more easily run (and more importantly, removed so as to deter robbers) in a vertical orientation. (Please note that within this article, 7N and 7S for example are referred to as a ‚Äòset‚Äô of shafts, whereas, 7N and 10N are referred to as a ‚Äòpair‚Äô)

Additionally, the low placement of these shaft openings within each chamber would be ineffective for promoting airflow as warmer air rises. This considerable investment in engineering and labor seems too deliberate to constitute or tolerate an inept airflow design. Furthermore, the significance of these ‚Äòstar shafts‚Äô may not lie solely in which stars they align with, but rather in the angle they form as a set‚Äî104 degrees‚Äîsupplementing the angles of each chamber‚Äôs horizon to 180 degrees.

> _More importantly, the two angles defined by these sets of shafts (King and Queen‚Äôs shaft sets), match an alignment to the Dzhanibekov rotation as viewed from the the two critical locations defined in Exhibit H2: The Giza Plateau and the Geographic Center of the World (see where¬†[The Eratosthenes Experiment](https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Astronomy__Cosmology/Astronomy_for_Educators_\(Barth\)/05%3A_Measuring_and_Mapping_the_Sky/5.04%3A_Measuring_the_Earth_with_Eratosthenes)¬†applies a similar heuristic). These two intervening differential angles, rather than the direct measurements or match to specific stars, carries the critical message of this monument._

**The Secret of the Shafts  
**_Each pair of shafts is affixed upon the same astronomical reference,  
the celestial north pole in two different Earth rotational orientations (Np and Np‚Äô)  
and from two different geographic locations (Giza and Geographic Center of the World).

**Exhibit L ‚Äì Khufu Shafts Aligned to Mediated Dzhanibekov Rotation Angle**¬†‚Äì from both the Turkey bisection latitude as well as Giza. Conceptually, here the builders of the pyramid have employed the King and Queen‚Äôs Chamber shafts to both demarcate and authenticate the shift from normal polar alignment at Np¬†(State 1) to the novel polar alignment at Np‚Äò (State 2). It is no accident that the alignment on the right, both bisects the Dzhanibekov rotation and happens to sit right on the Geographic Center of the World, 31.4¬∞ East Longitude and 38.4¬∞ North Latitude.

> _What the duplication in shafts and offset chambers serve to communicate, is an authentication of the change in celestial north pole location, during two different time periods. An intelligence which cannot be communicated by a single set of shafts, nor certainly by shaft combinations which do not agree._

The builders of the underlying observatory inside the Khufu pyramid depicted this principle from two differing geographic locations (Giza, left and Turkey, right), indicating a very sophisticated knowledge of the Earth‚Äôs diameter. What the duplication in shafts and offset chambers serve to communicate, is an authentication of the change in celestial north pole location, during two different time periods. An intelligence which cannot be communicated by a single set of shafts. Moreover, this coded message is something that cannot be defaced or dismantled by holy armies or their jealous God, cannot be rendered silent by righteous knowledge, nor consumed by fire or buried, nor eroded away by the elements.

Remember, regarding the lack of markings inside the pyramid to suggest a specific purpose, two issues arise. First, every hypothesis faces this challenge, not just this one, as there are no markings to confirm any proposed use of the edifice. Second, whatever was originally stored and obviously protected inside these chambers was likely removed by later interlopers. These interlopers did indeed erase any and all accessible markings (_Relation de l‚Äô√âgypte_¬†(the French translation) by Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi, Chapter IV, circa 1196 CE), even going so far as to forge red ochre ones as we noted in our previous article,¬†[Hidden in Plain Sight](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2023/12/18/hidden-in-plain-sight/). Therefore, the absence of markings is both an appeal to ignorance and ultimately moot.

Of course, it would have been helpful had the builder at least marked one of these inaccessible shafts to clearly indicate its polar direction at the time of its construction, or even better, use. Surely, someone of this sophistication would have anticipated the need for such an informative relic. One set into a location where it cannot be erased by The God‚Ñ¢ or debunked by The Science‚Ñ¢. Be patient, dear reader, as it may very well be that such a clue exists.

**If Stones Could Speak**

[![](https://i0.wp.com/theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/The-Stone-Speaks-6.png?resize=720%2C1112&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/The-Stone-Speaks-6.png?ssl=1)

**Exhibit M ‚Äì End of Queen‚Äôs Chamber Star Shaft**¬†‚Äì A star chart is carved into the last stone serving as the ceiling of the shaft. By Precession of the Equinoxes, that chart depicts a Giza skyline from 9200 to 9600¬†`BCE`. Plus, the depiction is of a north sky, used to align a southward pointing shaft.

In one of the star/air shafts extending upward from the Queen‚Äôs Chamber, there resides a curious set of non-hieroglyphic markings which were photograped by the Upuaut Project.[92](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-92-84997)¬†On the ceiling, just at the final stone before the block that terminates this shaft, a depiction of the night sky is carved. This artistic representation includes the constellations Ursa Minor and Ursa Major, Draco, Lacerta, Bootes, Cepheus, and Cassiopeia, unmistakably identifying this specific section of the sky and its orientation.

The stone depiction itself is centered on true north, with the celestial north pole anchored at the very bottom center of the stone framing ‚Äì almost as if this specific stone was employed to select a time and set of stars to ‚Äòshoot‚Äô (navigator‚Äôs term for obtaining a line of position from a given star) each night, in order to align the next day‚Äôs workload to true north (when no alignment guide would be available). Exhibit N below outlines this functional practice. This I found to constitute a rather clever artifice on the part of the construction foreman.

What remains in question is the timeframe represented by this depiction of the northern sky. Notably, the rendering centers on a celestial north pole that is significantly offset‚Äînot only from the current North Star, Polaris, which is expected due to the precession of the equinoxes, but also surprisingly far from the celestial north pole as it would have been positioned around the time of Khufu (circa 2540¬†`BCE`) ‚Äì inside the end of Draco‚Äôs tail (as depicted in the bottom panel of Exhibit M).

This depiction suggests a construction timeframe for the star shaft of around 9200 to 9600¬†`BCE`, as evidenced by comparing Exhibits M and N. Many of the stars represented in this carving would have been below the horizon in 2540¬†`BCE`¬†and thus invisible in this depiction, to observers of that era. A Starry NightTM¬†rendering of the northern sky at Giza as it appeared in 9200¬†`BCE`, which precisely matches the arrangement carved into the stone shown in Exhibit M, is shown below, along with the sextant-like alignment technique entailed.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/What-the-STone-Showed-2-3.png?resize=826%2C912&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/What-the-STone-Showed-2-3.png?ssl=1)

**Exhibit N ‚Äì Star Time Frame and Engineering Analogous to a Sextant**¬†‚Äì In practice, the foreman would take the shaft ceiling stone upon which the star map was marked,¬†[align the bottom center of the stone with the celestial north pole](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/The-Stone-Speaks-Alignment.png)¬†in the sky, and then ensure that the center of the stone matched exactly the azimuth and altitude of the celestial pole itself ‚Äì in this manner, aligning the next day‚Äôs work (as well as the shaft) to true north. The stone had to bisect the north sky horizontally so that the altitude of the celestial north pole could also be shot, along with its azimuth. If the foreman used an 8 inch mirror fit into the shaft itself, this would in essence be analogous to a sextant. Through employing this method, along with knowledge of the precession of the equinoxes (celestial position of the north pole over a 25,772 year cycle), the date range for construction of the shaft becomes abundantly clear.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pillar-43-Summary-Chart-CA-1.png?resize=869%2C391&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pillar-43-Summary-Chart-CA-1.png?ssl=1)

**Exhibit N2**¬†‚Äì The Vulture Stone (Pillar 43) at G√∂bekli Tepe indicates a construction date of 14,800¬†`BCE`.

The fact that all four of these shafts initially run at odd angles to the celestial north pole, thereafter reattaining the altitude and azimuth discipline in each case, indicates just how important this alignment was to the function of these shafts. They were not air shafts (despite our employment of that name at times herein). The copper fittings in the sealing stone were not for dropping the stone into place, as every stone in the pyramid had to be dropped into place, yet none of them used such labor intensive through-stone-fittings. Nor are the fittings placed at the right center of gravity to afford such a function. These were copper cables, for which we previously had no theory regarding their purpose‚Äîthat is until now.

The 9200 ‚Äì 9600¬†`BCE`¬†date range suggested by this shaft has been conjectured by some to match the dating carved into¬†[Pillar 43 at G√∂bekli Tepe](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2025/01/10/an-interpretation-of-gobekli-tepe-pillar-43/), or what is known as the ‚ÄòVulture Stone‚Äô.[93](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-93-84997)¬†In Exhibit N2 above one may observe where I have marked the Precession of the Equinoxes great circle onto the stellar depiction chiseled into Pillar 43. One should note that the circle, serving as the centerpiece of Pillar 43, depicts the celestial north pole and its location along the Precession of the Equinoxes around a date of 14,800¬†`BCE`. The Pillar 43 circle cannot possibly be the sun as many have suggested, as the sun moves along the ecliptic (to the¬†[lower left of the visible region in Exhibit N2](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pillar-43-Asterisms-and-POE-Variance-1.png)) and comes nowhere near Cygnus. The position of the celestial north pole above Cygnus‚Äô left wing (yellow circle in Exhibit N2) equates to 14,800¬†`BCE`. This pillar and its iconography was either copied or re-employed at the 9600¬†`BCE`¬†habitation at G√∂bekli Tepe, which interestingly coincides with Meltwater Pulse 1B. Because of monument alignment differences, as well as the comparative size of human cultures at those times, it is likely that the Khufu Pyramid therefore was constructed shortly after that calamitous event (given Khufu‚Äôs stark warning and design)‚Äîthereby matching the penultimate stone dating in Exhibit M above.

Perhaps it was findings like this, ones which inculpate Archonic powers in their Enochian unforgivable sins (genetic hybridizing, enslavement, sexual abuse, lifespan altering, human rights violations, ignorance, neglect, posing as God, and existential/spiritual torture), behind why excavation at Gobekli Tepe has been shut down by the Doƒüu≈ü Group at the behest of its 20-year funding sponsor, the World Economic Forum.[94](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-94-84997)¬†[95](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-95-84997)

As mentioned in¬†[our last article](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2023/12/18/hidden-in-plain-sight/), the momentary oceanic surges of this inundation rose to as high as 2200 feet above sea level for a very short period of time.

> _Notice in Exhibit N2 that the aurora borealis is carved into the stone above the depiction of celestial north (the circle on the condor‚Äôs wing), indicating that the cataclysm which the stone‚Äôs authors were attempting to document, was related to a far-reaching geomagnetic phenomenon._

Important information¬†[we do not want known today](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/06/13/the-principle-of-diminishing-narrative-returns/)._

This form of evidence is indeed inductive of course, nor do I believe that the builders constructed two of the Great Pyramid shafts while underwater during the counter-alignment. Complicatedness arises when we attempt to force simplicity upon a complex reality. This hypothesis in contrast is the first one to bear robust elegance. It was the last idea I considered‚Äîthe only one I could not falsify, yet it explains so many mysteries woven into mankind‚Äôs monument history.

Dismissing all such observations as mere cultural and religious symbolism which bears no relevance to our modern enlightened state‚Äîwhen in fact, the stone depictions are salient to specific embargoed constructs‚Äîmerely serves to perpetuate the linear induction or Nelsonian Ignorance Trap approach to science that we criticized at the outset of this article. Science is stuck in that trap regarding the Khafre and Khufu pyramids (and all ancient monuments in reality), in desperate need of disruption and paradigm shift. There is a great deal yet to be resolved with regard to this aspect of mankind‚Äôs history. Here, we are introducing a hypothesis, not another ‚Äòperfect answer‚Äô for a new doctrinal set of beliefs. If¬†_a priori_¬†perfect answers were the standard, the current consensus would have never survived to be considered in the first place. However, because of the critical and heteroductive nature of these observations, any hypothesis which leaves the issues cited in this series of articles unaddressed, meets the definition of pseudoscience.

Nonetheless, setting aside the debate over the possible date range for the stone star depiction, one fact remains unmistakably clear:

**An Epilogue in Epic: The 175 Global Flood Myths**

I encourage the reader to contrast the below material with the biblical recount of Noah. In the Noah tale, one may observe a story heavily rewritten so that the targeted population could¬†[understand, as opposed to comprehend](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2022/01/06/the-distinction-between-comprehension-and-understanding/), the evolution of events.

> _There‚Äôs also a purpose behind the Torah‚Äôs exaggerated version of this event: to push people into camps of gullibility or outright rejection‚Äîdeliberately omitting and obfuscating the reality that lies in between._

The biblical flood narrative (note: when we use the colloquial translation term ‚Äòflood‚Äô in this article, the context is oceanic inundation) reduces that set of events into familiar tropes: it was ‚Äòman‚Äôs fault‚Äô (sound familiar?), it ‚Äòrained‚Äô (for a familiar esoteric number of days), then there were these magic ‚Äòfountains‚Äô, and all that massive excess oceana (over triple the volume of all oceans which exist today) just disappeared in a couple months ‚Äì poof! Finally, a fully mature olive tree mysteriously reappeared in 47 days[99](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-99-84997)¬†‚Äì when it takes an olive pit 6 months to germinate and produce its first leaf even under optimal conditions.[100](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-100-84997)¬†Give me strength‚Ä¶(ChatGPT-4o¬†[comments accordingly](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Recount-of-Noah-ChatGPT4o-1.png))

**Exhibit O**¬†‚Äì Seal of The King of Mohenjo Daro.

Curiously, in the Epic of Gilgamesh‚Äôs Tablets IX, X, and XI, King of Uruk, Gilgamesh, set out upon a quest to find his ancestor Utnapishtim. Utnapishtim had been granted immortality by the Gods after he had followed one God‚Äôs (Ea/Enki) direction to build a large boat. He then loaded the vessel with his kith, kin, and domesticated animals, and successfully survived an epic inundation. Gilgamesh, being two thirds God himself, desired to understand the mystery of immortality (my commentary: why someone would wish to live forever in this realm is beyond me).

Accordingly, Gilgamesh crossed the Mountains of Mashu, and marched for days eastward. The Great Flood Story Segment E in the Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature (ETCSL) confirms that Utnapishtim‚Äôs residence was in the ‚ÄúLand of Dilmun, where the sun rises.‚Äù[101](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-101-84997)¬†Thereafter, his team portaged and powered by poles up a river for three days (hundreds of miles, or a month and a half‚Äôs normal journey according to the text), whereupon they attained their objective.[102](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-102-84997)¬†This journey could only equate to the mouth of the Indus River and upriver passage to one of the oldest cities in the world,¬†[Mahenjo Daro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohenjo-daro)¬†(3 days at 4 knots = 327 miles, Mahenjo Daro is 325 miles upriver). There, Gilgamesh encountered Utnapishtim, who was running a river trading and fishing business.

Utnapishtim recounted to Gilgamesh how his world was lost in a mere day‚Äôs sudden turning, not ‚Äú40 days and 40 nights‚Äù of rain ‚Äì a catastrophe not wrought by sustained storms, celestial impacts, or solar coronal mass ejection, but rather by a displaced sea, kinetically mixed with displacing atmospheric winds, swiftly surmounting the mountains in one sudden, overwhelming inundation. This combination of water borne upon high winds (not the same as rain), the shattering of the land, and sudden encroaching of the ocean (Segment E of the ETCSL regarded that the inundation would ‚Äúsweep over the land‚Äù) ‚Äì constitute georotation phenomena ‚Äì and nothing else.

Utnapishtim thus related to Gilgamesh:[103](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-103-84997)

As one can see from the various comparative notes on inundation myths, three or four of the most prominent deluge myths, aside from the Torah, match the specifics of the timeline depicted above. Indeed, of the 175+ recorded global ‚Äòflood‚Äô myths (P. Bobrowsky, et al., 2007), 33 provide a time period in which the cataclysm occurred‚Äîresulting in an average period of onset (not total duration of high ocean levels) of 6.5 days for the consensus group of 24 mythologies inside this subset.[104](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-104-84997)¬†Fourteen of the myths specifically cite a seven day inundation timeframe.[105](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-105-84997)¬†[106](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-106-84997)

The Chinese Gun-Yu myth cited above is one of two that specify or imply how long the people struggled with the displaced waters (two generations, most of 1 lifespan, or 50 years ‚Äì our Karst erosion estimate top end). Nonetheless, if our hypothesis bears merit, we believe this inundation effect to be part of a repeating cycle (ECDO ‚Äì oscillation).

Notice as well, that according to the Chinese inundation myth of N√ºwa, their land proceeded to the southeast, while the sky moved to the northwest. This is exactly what happens to¬†[China in the Mediated Dzhanibekov Rotation](https://x.com/i/status/1800217461301879264)¬†shown moving from State 1 to State 2 in Exhibit J3 above.

> _From the Library of Ashurbanipal comes The Legend of Etana.[107](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-107-84997)¬†The largest and most famous collection of cuneiform tablets, including the Legend of Etana, was discovered at Nineveh, the capital of Assyria. Etana was a legendary king of Kish, mentioned in the Sumerian King List, and he was said to have sought to build a great tower or city. However, he encountered difficulties because the people were fearful of coming down from the mountains, where they had taken refuge after a great flood. According to the King List, Etana ruled during the Early Dynastic Period, around the early 3rd millennium BCE (approximately 2900‚Äì2800 BCE or earlier). The Sumerian King List places him after the flood and as one of the kings who ‚Äúmade the foundations of civilization‚Äù in the post-flood world._
> 
> _Gilgamesh, on the other hand, is listed as a king of Uruk in a later section of the King List, during the Early Dynastic Period as well, but at a later time. Scholars typically date Gilgamesh to around the 27th to 26th century BCE._

**Exhibit P**¬†‚Äì Surface keelboat compared to Enki‚Äôs circular submarine‚Äî‚Äùequal on all sides‚Äù‚Äînot a ‚Äòcube‚Äô as is popularly spun.

Finally, pertaining to the comparative credibility of the Torah/Bible narrative, as a lifelong sailor of sometimes heavy seas, I recognize that a long and narrow keelboat design, also known as a ‚Äòsurface-piercing/large freeboard‚Äô class of ocean vessel, especially one not under power, would not have survived the kinetic inundation described. The popular depictions of Noah‚Äôs Ark, purported by the Bible to be a 450 x 75 x 45 ft vessel of this class (aspect ratio of 6:1 ‚Äì see top two panels of Exhibit P to the right), would not have withstood the bow-on sea-state-induced moment called ‚Äòhogging,‚Äô and its segmented 450 ft keel would have snapped very quickly.

Furthermore, when waves hit broadside to such a long and narrow vessel, the vessel would have rolled completely, potentially for days on end. Add significant ballast to this, mix the hogging, sagging, and heeling moments into a twisting torsion along a 450 ft keel made of wooden segments, and suddenly you have a violent enclosed space from which no one, including the ship itself, would have survived.[108](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-108-84997)

From extensive experience in a variety of vessel designs, one does not construct a ship of this design without a means to propel it through the water and keep the bow into the seas and wind. A long, thin, dead-in-the-water surface keelboat is a fatal disadvantage in heavy seas. This observation, as much as anything, suggests to me that the Torah/Bible story was a later fabrication. This was not a fanciful, symbolic, allegorical, nor inspirational story to demonstrate God‚Äôs providence and mercy. It was a lie‚Äîand all other more accurate versions of the account were obliterated or buried. The question is, why? The reader should take note that such obfuscation becomes a consistent pattern in regard to human history and origins.

The only feasible boat design that might have survived such a kinetic inundation would have been a mostly-submerged circular bucket-shaped ‚Äòsubmarine‚Äô with deep ballast. In this design, hogging load dynamics would be distributed circumferentially first, and then radially toward the leeward aspect of the vessel, while the hogging moment itself would be much less pronounced as waves would crest over the ship, and could not place hogging load under it, minimizing all surface effects in the process. Additionally, there would be no rolling since the ship would never present a ‚Äòlong‚Äô side in any scenario ‚Äì being an upright ‚Äòpole‚Äô to a degree. The mythical God Enki‚Äôs ark design (see third panel in Exhibit P), one of this exact nature he submitted to Atra-Hasis, was rather non-mythical in its engineered approach to such unprecedented challenges.[109](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-109-84997)

Before we close, let‚Äôs take a few more steps down this uncomfortable pathway of cataclysm for just a moment. Of course, this entire construct raises the key existential question: Why would a responsible entity of any kind purposely place or develop a large sentient civilization like humanity on an ECDO planet prone to frequent flipping, knowing the immense suffering this would cause? This argues poignantly for an atheist viewpoint.

If, however, a putative entity of such opportunity and influence had indeed done this, and if this action could be judged as wrong by an outside party, would this entity not want the evidence of such maliciousness destroyed or even blamed upon randomness or the wickedness of the victims themselves? Would such a despicable act constitute the Enochian ‚Äòunforgivable sin‚Äô‚Äîa blasphemy against the Force that protects pneuma-life throughout the universe?[110](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-110-84997)¬†Mandating its obfuscation by¬†[every available means](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2021/10/16/eternal-are-the-embers-which-conflagrate-the-library-of-history/)‚Äîscientific, rhetorical, religious, burning, interment, shortening of human lifespan, social ridicule and defamation, or imperial conquest‚Äîit would not matter. A will of such desperation that it might only be thwarted by the gravitas of two million two-and-a-half-ton stones.

> _Perhaps the Great Pyramid did not constitute a monument after all; rather, it was a purposed message, a safekeep for a preexisting observatory, an impossible stack of stones both flagging the importance of what resides underneath and ensuring that this intellectual property could neither be washed away again, nor confiscated to damnatio memoriae by those who regard themselves as gods. But they try ‚Ä¶ oh, they do try._

Such exhibits the elegance of publishing ideas like this inside a private blog article. I do not have to adopt the¬†_pro forma_¬†and magisterial edicts of those who embargo questions, ideas, and evidence. Wallowing in the quagmire of linear inductive Nelsonian ignorance, while adorning the ironic priestly robes of inquiry.

Perhaps of an even more curious final note, the seal of the first King of Mahenjo Daro, the city we contend inside which Gilgamesh sought to find Utnapishtim,[111](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-bottom-111-84997)¬†despite its being located a couple hundred miles up the Indus River, depicted a large ocean-going vessel, along with a raven and a dove.

34. _1. ‚ÄúThe ‚Äòprecise alignment to true north‚Äô of Khufu is based upon an extrapolation and interpretation as to where the Tura casing stone footers ended. As such, those stone alignments involve a certain level of speculative reconstruction, as we do not actually know how the casing of the pyramid actually aligned versus true north. The claim of ‚Äúextraordinary precision,‚Äù while based on real measurements and sound archaeological methods, is subject to the inherent limitations and uncertainties arising from the missing original casing stones, corners, and the use of partial data. In addition, alignment to north in the Khufu pyramid today can vary greatly based upon which course of backing stones one chooses as their alignment reference. It is fair to recognize that some of the romanticized precision claims, while based on solid analysis, do contain a hint of narrative embellishment to entice interest in the pyramid‚Äôs sophistication and the mysteries of its construction.‚Äù ChatGPT-4o
    
    2. Mechanism Locking True North for 4,550 Years: The Earth‚Äôs rotational axis (true north) has maintained a stable alignment with the Khufu Pyramid for the past 4,550 years by the Narrative (actually 6,000+ years, and possibly 9600 years). Some geophysical mechanism would be needed to keep the rotational axis precisely locked that entire time, preventing significant shifts in the Earth‚Äôs orientation. We are missing that key mechanism as a premise to this argument. If one is to ask the former question, one must also ask this inverse question as well. It suggests an appeal to ignorance at play, and need for genuine skepticism both ways.  
      
    3. Variance of Nutation within Precession: We do not have precise measurements of the celestial pole‚Äôs nutation variance within the 25,772-year precession cycle. This lack of detailed understanding means we cannot definitively conclude whether the Great Pyramid‚Äôs precision alignment to true north is purely coincidental within this variance or if another factor ensures this alignment. Of the 90 or so global monuments from antiquity which align to the current georotational north pole, the group bears a range of variation of +/- 1.5¬∞ (see this article by Mario Buildreps:¬†[https://www.mariobuildreps.com/orientation-pyramids-former-north-poles/](https://www.mariobuildreps.com/orientation-pyramids-former-north-poles/)). This is not very precise as a group of measures. Again, we risk an appeal to ignorance with regarding the Giza alignment.  
      
    4. Disagreement between Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure Alignments:The alignments of the Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure pyramids to true north do not perfectly match each other, both within each structure (intra-structure) and between the two structures (inter-structure). How do we address this discrepancy tolerance? What physical feature do we select as our single reference for this contention of precision ‚Äì the one which is closest to true north? That is cherry picking a the most convenient premise for our argument.  
      
    5. Other Aligned Monuments: What about the myriad (912 ‚Äì 90 = 822) of other aligned global monuments that indicate significant historical true polar wander and/or disagreement as to true north? Many of these (all aligned to true north) converge on celestial north poles far from our current one. Do we simply discard the whole body of observational evidence to emphasize only one observation or small subset (9.9%) of observations (see this article by Mario Buildreps:¬†[https://www.mariobuildreps.com/orientation-pyramids-former-north-poles/](https://www.mariobuildreps.com/orientation-pyramids-former-north-poles/))?  
      
    6. Inconsistent Alignment within Pyramids: Different components of each pyramid show slight deviations from the true north alignment. This suggests that while the builders aimed for alignment, natural construction variances may have led to accidentals and/or misalignments. In other words, did we cherry pick what we chose as our internal alignment reference as a touch of cultural grandstanding?  
      
    7. Finally, there exists a superior (in theoretical applications) description of electromagnetic force which describes it in terms of A (the vector potential) and œï (the scalar potential) and not simply classic physics E (electric field) and B (magnetic field) mechanics. A and œï theory allows for descriptions that emphasize continuity and the potential for topological and quantum effects that manage the behavior of magnetic bodies in space. In other words, the Earth‚Äôs geomagnetic field does not exist in isolation‚Äîit interacts or is affixed within the solar system A and œï magnetic environment. The A field could provide the mechanism by which: 1. The Earth‚Äôs magnetic system aligns with or is constrained by external magnetic forces. 2. Subtle adjustments in orientation are guided by interactions between the Earth‚Äôs A field and external vector potentials (not simply itself), providing the precision observed in ECDO theory of State 2 return to State 1. While this issue is indeed salient, it is merely inductive, appeals to ignorance, ignores modern A and œï scalar physics, is exposed to the possibility of accident, risks tolerance vulnerability, relies on cherry-picking/cultural grandstanding, and does not rise to the level of a falsification.[](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-34-84997)

35. _Furthermore, the measurement error tolerance for any given time interval spanned nearly to the Leschamps excursion limit (6% of DM2017¬†= 80 ZAm2) to begin with.(Panovska S., Korte M., & Constable C. G. (2019). One hundred thousand years of geomagnetic field evolution. Reviews of Geophysics, 57, 1289‚Äì1337.¬†[https://doi.org/10.1029/2019RG000656](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019RG000656)) The¬†[Panovska study cited above](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Earth-Core-GeoMoment.png)¬†even summed together the age-uncertainty blending of study averages, which themselves data smoothed over large timescales extrapolated from small geographic sampling regions, and only when such measures were in agreement (Panovska, Section 2.3).
    
    > _In other words, these studies do not feature a temporal resolution which would alert to this type of event. It would simply appear as noise inside a mundane geomagnetic excursion, if at all._
    > 
    > _Greenland and Antarctic ice cores will fail to reveal evidence of this species of true polar wander. The world during State 2 was tectonically active‚Äîdark, cold, and wet‚Äînot some sunlit, balmy paradise merely spinning on a different axis. How, then, could one possibly refute this reality with ice cores alone? The supposed 700,000-year continuity in ice core data is a linear, inductive assumption‚Äîan unchallenged premise, not an inference drawn from rigorous deduction._
    
    The study chart plot-lines look pretty and authoritative‚Äîwith lots of intimidating notation (‚Äú(V)(A)DM [ZAm2]‚Äù) and precision-implying summation functions (‚Äú_V(r, Œ∏, œÜ, t)¬†= Œ£Œ£Œ£_¬†(_a/r)‚Äù_) serving as academic window dressing and proxy for a conceptually straightforward yet imprecise measure (volcanic material ‚Äòthermoremanent magnetization‚Äô with 70% of the sampling derived from Europe and Turkey). Such confidence/blending results contrast starkly with the currently observed speed of dipole moment weakening, one which is 10 times faster than any measure found inside these paleogeomagnetic studies‚Äîincluding the Leschamps event.(Fiona MacDonald; Science Alert: New Study Shows How Rapidly Earth‚Äôs Magnetic Field Is Changing; 11 May 2016;¬†[https://www.sciencealert.com/new-study-shows-that-earth-s-magnetic-field-is-weakening-more-rapidly-than-we-thought](https://www.sciencealert.com/new-study-shows-that-earth-s-magnetic-field-is-weakening-more-rapidly-than-we-thought))
    
    This is Gaussian blindness, and as such it is not very informative. It is akin to estimating the ten-minute-interval speed of a car during a 10-day trip, with a standard deviation-based confidence band ranging from 10 to 110 miles per hour and a discrimination interval of half a day, from sampling only conducted while the car was on two-lane roads, and only by means of an agreement between tire and wind noise (no speedometer). Based on this type of analytical approach, the car would never exceeded the speed limit and never stop even once for gas, fuel, or restroom.
    
    > _In systems engineering, when transient signal dynamics exceed weak-observation histories by a factor of 10, the confidence in such historical observations is significantly reduced._(Chiang, L.H. et al.; ‚ÄúFault Detection and Diagnosis in Industrial Systems‚Äù; 2001; ISBN: 1-85233-327-8.)

    Gyre-driven models (Finlay, Aubert, 2016) of our current decline in the Earth‚Äôs geomagnetic moment, place the attainment of a Leschamps-level of decay, as occurring in less than 1000 years (1900 years to ‚Äúzero‚Äù), a timeframe far below the resolution of current paleogeomagnetic models.(Finlay, C., Aubert, J. & Gillet, N.

Three German nationals‚ÄîDominique G√∂rlitz, Stefan Erdmann, and Peter Hoefer‚Äîentered the pyramid in April 2013 and extracted samples from a cartouche bearing Pharaoh Khufu‚Äôs name, aiming to support alternative theories about the pyramid‚Äôs origins. These actions led to their conviction in absentia, alongside six Egyptians accused of facilitating the act, with all nine receiving five-year prison sentences. Egyptian judicial sources have confirmed that the stolen cartouche ochre material was recovered by German authorities in Berlin, and then handed-over to the Egyptian Embassy in August.‚Äù[](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-68-84997)_

74. _ChatGPT-4o agrees with our engineer:
    
    1. Active Antenna Characteristics (Medium Frequency/High Frequency Antenna)  
    An active antenna with a standing wave ratio (SWR) of 1.27 indicates a relatively low amount of power reflected back towards the source, which is efficient for signal transmission and reception. The design frequency of 1.932 MHz and its resonances at various frequencies suggest a broad range of operability. This range of resonances could imply a sophisticated design, possibly to maximize sensitivity across multiple frequency bands. Such a feature might have been employed for detecting a wide range of signals or for enhancing communication capabilities.
    
    2. Close Proximity of Cables  
    The close proximity of the two cables could indeed afford high amperage and low voltage, particularly in an active antenna configuration. In such a setup, the antenna might use an active component, like a transistor or amplifier, to boost signal strength. This increased sensitivity would be crucial for detecting weak signals or for long-range communication. The high amperage could enhance the antenna‚Äôs ability to pick up faint signals, making it more effective in its role.
    
    3. Polarized or Differential Detection  
    The potential for using the two cables in a polarized or differential detection role is worth exploring. Polarization could help in distinguishing between different signal sources or reducing interference from unwanted directions. Differential detection could enhance signal clarity by comparing the signals received by the two cables, effectively canceling out noise and improving signal-to-noise ratio. This might not have been commented upon, but it could provide additional functionality to the antenna system.[](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-74-84997)

80. _ChatGPT-4o comments: To detect P-waves effectively in a static chamber infiltrated with sensors, the fluid used should have properties that allow efficient transmission of seismic waves while being compatible with the sensors and the chamber environment. One of the best fluids for this purpose is water. Here are the reasons why:  
    Acoustic Impedance Matching: Water has an acoustic impedance that is well-matched to many materials used in seismic sensors, ensuring efficient transmission of P-waves from the fluid to the sensors.  
    High Transmission Speed: P-waves travel through water at a speed of approximately 1500 meters per second, which is relatively high compared to other fluids, allowing for clear and fast detection of seismic signals.  
    Low Attenuation: Water has low attenuation for seismic waves, meaning the waves can travel longer distances without significant loss of energy, leading to clearer signals.  
    Availability and Safety: Water is readily available, non-toxic, and safe to handle, making it a practical choice for use in a controlled experimental setup.  
    Temperature Stability: Water maintains its properties over a range of temperatures, which is beneficial for consistent and reliable seismic measurements.  
    While other fluids like mineral oil or glycerin could also be used, they often have higher attenuation or are less practical to handle. Thus, water is generally considered the best fluid for detecting P-waves in such a setup.[](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-80-84997)_

83. _The frequency range for infrasound, which can be generated by natural sources such as earthquakes, volcanic activity, and other geological phenomena, typically lies between 0.1 Hz and 10 Hz. This is the range where infrasound waves are most effective at traveling long distances through the Earth‚Äôs solid materials, such as those originating from the core (Inner Core Boundary and/or D‚Äù layer) and propagating to the surface.  
    Earthquake P-waves are employed as the sound generation mechanism for the velocity based mapping of the core and LLVP structures themselves. Body waves, specifically Primary waves (P-waves), that travel through the Earth as a result of an earthquake typically have a frequency range between 0.1 Hz and 10 Hz. However, most of the energy from these waves is concentrated in the lower part of this range, typically from 1 Hz to 5 Hz. Inner Earth activity is attenuated more quickly because it falls in the higher frequencies, 5 Hz to 10 Hz.  
    P-waves are capable of traveling through the Earth‚Äôs interior and are the fastest seismic waves, thus they are the first to be detected by seismometers after an earthquake occurs. This makes the 5 to 10 Hz range quite reasonable for detecting infrasound signals emanating from deep within the Earth, including potential core noise (sources: Wikipedia on Infrasound, White, B. C., Elbing, B. R., and Faruque, I. A.: Infrasound measurement system for real-time in situ tornado measurements, Atmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 2923‚Äì2938,¬†[https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-2923-2022](https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-2923-2022), 2022.).  
    This frequency range corresponds to wavelengths that are tens of meters long, making them suitable for penetrating deep into the Earth‚Äôs structure and reaching the surface where they can be monitored. These properties of infrasound align well with the idea of using such frequencies to detect and study geophysical phenomena originating from the Earth‚Äôs core and other deep layers.[](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/12/exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-ecdo-hypothesis/#easy-footnote-83-84997)_
