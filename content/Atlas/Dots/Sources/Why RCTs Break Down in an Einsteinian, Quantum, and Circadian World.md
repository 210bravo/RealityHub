## Summary

Dahhaj argues that randomized controlled trials (RCTs), often considered the gold standard in scientific research, have significant limitations when applied to complex systems like human biology or social dynamics. The author draws an analogy to Einstein’s theory of relativity, suggesting that RCTs assume a "Newtonian" simplicity that fails to account for the interconnected, non-linear, and context-dependent nature of real-world phenomena.

### Key points:

- RCTs' Limitations: RCTs rely on isolating variables and assume linear cause-and-effect relationships, which oversimplifies complex systems where multiple factors interact dynamically.
    
- Einsteinian Perspective: The article compares the shift from Newtonian physics to Einstein’s relativity to the need for a new scientific paradigm that embraces complexity, variability, and interconnectedness.
    
- Context Matters: RCTs often ignore individual differences (e.g., genetics, environment, lifestyle), leading to results that may not generalize across diverse populations or real-world settings.
    
- Alternative Approaches: The author advocates for research methods like systems biology, longitudinal studies, and real-world evidence to better capture complexity and improve applicability.
    
- Practical Implications: Overreliance on RCTs can lead to misguided policies or medical interventions, as they may not reflect the nuanced reality of human systems.
    

The article calls for a more holistic, adaptive approach to scientific inquiry that aligns with the complexity of modern challenges, moving beyond the rigid framework of RCTs.
