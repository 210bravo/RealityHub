# Detailed Summary of the Episode

This episode of Becoming Brigitte marks a significant escalation in Candace Owens’ investigative series. Following Alexandre Benalla’s unexpected Instagram follow, Owens dives deeper into the identity mystery surrounding Brigitte Macron, focusing on the 1977 "Véronique" interview, Jean-Michel Trogneux’s marriage to Véronique Dru, and Emmanuel Macron’s questionable rise with Rothschild ties. The episode blends new evidence, AI analysis, and viewer engagement, positioning Owens as a relentless truth-seeker against elite suppression, with sponsorships and a teased Xavier Poussard interview adding layers to the narrative.

## Introduction and Benalla’s Engagement

- Benalla’s Follow: Owens reveals [[Alexandre Benalla]], Macron’s former deputy chief of staff, began following her on Instagram two days prior, interpreting it as a deliberate signal given her public profile. She slid into his DMs, inviting him to join the series, but he left it “seen” 12 hours ago, prompting her to await a response while emphasizing her commitment to fair representation.
- Context: This follows last week’s discussion of Benalla’s scandals (beating protesters, Russian ties), framing his follow as a potential acknowledgment of the series’ impact.

## Revisiting the Véronique Interview

- Recap: Owens revisits the 1977 interview with "Véronique," a transitioning individual with Brigitte Macron’s voice and “that is to say” tick, confirmed by AI as the same person aged over time. Last episode’s focus was expanded to highlight Véronique’s admission of living with a woman “in the style of George Sand and Chopin,” suggesting a partner or alibi.
- Significance: This aligns with Jean-Michel Trogneux’s life, raising questions about his transition and Brigitte’s identity, with Véronique’s intellectual references (Chopin, Verlaine, Rimbaud) mirroring the Macrons’ public persona.

## Jean-Michel Trogneux’s Marriage and Family

- 1980 Wedding: Jean-Michel married Véronique Dru on November 24, 1980, in Blan Trv, with Brigitte as the sole witness. The union, announced post-event in L’Auver Pioné, occurred in “strictest privacy,” echoing Tiphaine’s description of André-Louis Auzière’s funeral.
- Children: The couple had Jean-Jacques Trogneux in 1982 (resembling Emmanuel) and Valérie Trogneux in 1984. Their 1987 divorce was followed by Véronique’s remarriage to Alain de la Simone in 1998, adopting a lavish lifestyle.
- Disappearance: Jean-Michel’s photographic trail ends post-1987, coinciding with Brigitte’s traceable teaching career starting in 1986, suggesting a deliberate erasure.

## Véronique Dru’s Interview and Lies

- Xavier Poussard’s Contact: Journalist Xavier Poussard interviewed Véronique Dru, who dismissed rumors of Jean-Michel transitioning into Brigitte, citing two children (Jean-Jacques, Valérie) and no knowledge of Emmanuel until Valérie’s wedding. She claimed post-divorce life with her mother, but records show she lived in a Trogneux-owned Amiens apartment.
- Documentary Evidence: Véronique lied on a 1992 tax document (listing only Serge Franch as a prior husband) and a 2018 Corsica property document (claiming no prior marriages), indicating a pattern of concealing her marriage to Jean-Michel.
- Interruption: During the call, someone else’s presence stopped Véronique after she mentioned knowing Macron’s father, Jean-Michel Macron, adding intrigue about family suppression.

## Emmanuel Macron’s Dubious Rise

- Myth Debunked: The 2020 debunking of Macron as a writer (no novels, despite claims) is revisited, with his persona as a Mozart virtuoso and Chopin lover exposed as fabricated, possibly to justify his statutory rape relationship with Brigitte.
- ENA and Rothschild Ties: Macron failed ENA entry twice but was admitted in 2002 without an oral exam, with cooked rankings prompting a 2021 cancellation. At Rothschild Bank (2008), he rose to managing partner by 32 despite financial ignorance, aided by David de Rothschild’s intervention, bypassing norms.
- Rothschild Influence: Bank documents mistakenly list his birth in Paris (not Amiens), and Macron admitted in 2012 to Rothschild’s pivotal role, with executives noting his high-level contacts and poor technical skills.

## AI Technology and Identity Analysis

- Face++ Introduction: Owens showcases Face++, a Beijing-based AI ranked by the World Economic Forum as a top facial recognition tool, used by China for social credit. It accurately identifies altered faces (e.g., Kim Basinger, Shirley Temple) with high confidence (70%+).
- Application to Case: Face++ confirms low probability (e.g., 52%) that André-Louis’s cousin Jean-Louis Auzière is the wedding groom, vindicating Poussard over Natasha Ray’s sued mistake. It also suggests Jean-Michel’s school photo matches Brigitte’s current image (17.3% with modifications), while the wedding and communion photos don’t align with her, supporting a transition theory.
- Implications: Owens expresses unease about AI’s globalist potential but credits it for precision in avoiding defamation traps.

## The Rothschild Connection and Elite Grooming

- Scandals: Owens alludes to Rothschild ties to Jeffrey Epstein and incest/endogamy practices, citing Natalie Reims’ confession of family silence, linking it to a state-protected secret.
- Macron’s Grooming: His loner childhood, grandmother Manette’s pedophile-centric book interest, and lack of parental closeness suggest MKUltra-like manipulation, paralleling Kamala Harris and Barack Obama’s upbringings.
- Suppression: Anti-Semitism charges against Poussard for unrelated media critiques highlight efforts to silence investigation.

# Overall Narrative

This episode advances Owens’ theory that Jean-Michel Trogneux transitioned into Brigitte Macron, supported by the "Véronique" interview, Véronique Dru’s lies, and Face++ analysis, with Jean-Jacques’ resemblance adding weight. Macron’s groomed rise, Rothschild backing, and ENA irregularities suggest elite manipulation, while suppression efforts (Benalla’s follow, media attacks) fuel suspicion. Owens positions herself as a courageous exposer of a dark agenda, bolstered by AI, viewer support, and her platform, promising deeper revelations with Poussard.

all right ladies and gentlemen so we knew 
that Emanuel macron and breit were watching   this series but I am so pleased to report 
that so is their surrounding cast or their  

00:09
former surrounding cast I guess last week 
we discussed Alexander banala I introduced  

00:14
him to you their former deputy chief of staff 
who was caught impersonating a police officer  

00:20
and kind of beating the living heck out 
of protesters in the street well guess   what two days later that young gentleman 
began following me on Instagram I say the  

00:29
more marrier so welcome back hello Alexander 
panala welcome back to our series becoming

00:35
Brit honestly I couldn't believe it when I saw 
it it was like a priority um note on my Instagram  

00:57
it's like Alexander Bala started following you 
and I was like whoo okay obviously whoo what's  

01:03
the meaning of this I'm not exactly sure what the 
purpose of the follow was given the fact that my  

01:09
profile is public so you don't have to follow me 
you can just look at my profile privately I take  

01:16
it that he wanted me to know that he was following 
me but you guys know me I never squander away an  

01:22
opportunity so I basically hit him up in his DMs 
I slid into Alexander bala's DMS here's what I  

01:29
said said okay I said I'm glad you're enjoying 
my series would you care to participate in it  

01:35
to have your voice added and look it says seen 
12 hours ago Alexander banala left me on red so  

01:44
sad very sad anyways I guess we'll just uh give 
him some time maybe he'll respond maybe he'll   contribute the point of that always is I want 
to make sure that I am representing people the  

01:54
correct way we've asked brijit we've asked 
Emanuel nobody wants to give me any answers  

02:00
so what we're going to do this episode is just 
start where we left off we discussed veronique and  

02:05
that was extremely explosive obviously for a lot 
of people to learn that you had this individual  

02:12
who was obviously highly intellectual and talking 
about uh shopan and speaking about poetry and Paul  

02:19
verlain and and speaking about how they needed 
this platform talking about a show in 1977 to  

02:27
essentially advocate so that there were well 
transgendered rights and I want to specifically  

02:35
speak about veronique in terms of what was offered 
something that we didn't hone in on last episode  

02:41
it was there was a part of the correspondence 
which is going to become significant so when   the interviewer asked vinique do you live 
alone remember vernique responded and said I'm  

02:52
not with anyone but I've lived with a woman and 
conceived this Union in the style of George son  

03:00
and chopan chopan was probably a transsexual his 
style of Melody the way he plays makes this quite  

03:07
clear I think the image that has been given of 
the rod verlain Union is a distorted caricatured  

03:13
image that doesn't correspond at all so this 
trans individual who speaks exactly like Brit  

03:20
mccrone according to AI Tech they say this is the 
same person although the voice has aged over time  

03:27
they have those same ticks in speech that is to 
say that is to say but we learn in that little  

03:34
correspondence that that trans individual or 
identifying as a trans individual said or actually  

03:40
said I've always viewed myself to be a woman was 
using this name veronique for the sake of the  

03:46
interview and confessed to living with a woman 
in the style of George sand and shopan whatever  

03:54
that means we know this person has a partner of 
some description a friend a partner I don't know  

04:00
I really don't know what that means but then we 
learned that John Michelle trno in another strange  

04:06
co uh coincidence shortly after this interview 
took place happened to marry a woman named yeah  

04:13
you guessed it veronique of course veronique Drew 
we are now introducing to you and Jean Michelle  

04:21
had their marriage take place on November 24th 
1980 in Blan TRV a city named Blan trvel or a town  

04:31
named Blan TRV the union was only announced by the 
way after the fact okay so did not occur after the  

04:39
fact the local newspaper Lauer peard ran a little 
bit about it and in that since not all of us  

04:47
speak French it specifies that the union between 
these two between mour and Madame Jean trno and  

04:55
Madame jacqu Drew um took place in the strictest 
privacy or we heard that before we've heard that  

05:04
before haven't we in the strictest privacy uh I 
remember tone used that exact same language when  

05:10
she described the burial of her father only we 
later learned that her father wasn't buried he  

05:15
was cremated but whatever that's what Paris match 
said in the strictest privacy so John Michelle  

05:21
trau getting married I don't know many people who 
get married and want to make sure it is in the   strictest privacy but that's what happened between 
these two individuals veronique and John Michelle  

05:31
trno and you'll never guess who was the witness 
to this wedding bid trno so man these siblings  

05:38
are really close which makes it even stranger 
that down the line this person who's claiming  

05:44
to have been bit trno who is living in the El 
Palace as the first lady just tried to cut her  

05:52
brother Jean Michelle trogo out of her life until 
journalists sniffed it out that there was somebody  

05:58
that was missing but yes um it is recorded that 
Brit trno was the the witness the only witness  

06:05
that signed to this strictly confidential wedding 
okay then what happens next is it's recorded that  

06:13
Jean Michelle trno and veronique Drew had a child 
John Jack trno that is the child that we showed  

06:20
you that looks almost identical to Emmanuel mro 
it's it's really hard to convince me that these  

06:29
two people are not related but they're not guys 
not according they're to the official no Legend  

06:35
they're definitely not married that's Brit's side 
of the family and then two years later John Melle  

06:41
trno and veronique Drew have a daughter Valerie 
then very shortly thereafter they get divorced  

06:49
their divorce is finalized in 1987 now then 
things get super interesting post divorce uh uh  

06:59
veronic Drew remarries years later 1998 a man 
named uh Alan deas Simone he is a major insurer  

07:09
from Aman now something worth noting is that after 
her marriage to Jean Michelle veronique classes up  

07:16
like she now has money and she begins living a 
life The High Life that she never lived prior to  

07:22
okay can happen I guess you can class up in life 
but it's just worth noting that she's living in a   way that she hadn't lived before so naturally the 
journalist uh Xavier pussard contacted her that  

07:34
seemed like a good place to start like if you're 
trying to determine whether or not John Michelle   trogo transitioned and became bit Marron you have 
to be willing to accept some evidence that would  

07:44
point to the fact that you are wrong that your 
thesis is wrong and thus far everybody's coming  

07:49
up dry it's just they don't want to give you any 
answers we're getting these manufactured pictures   um or pictures that can only come through 
Best Image only come through Mimi marshan  

08:00
which are images that should not of course be 
trusted because Mimi marshand has an extensive  

08:05
criminal history she has been accused of many of 
forgery many of extortion and she's in a lot of  

08:11
trouble right now so anyways Xavier brousard 
decided to contact veronique Drew and guess  

08:17
what she spoke with him how strange somebody in 
the family in the unit speaking to a journalist  

08:24
and she wanted to speak with him you know when 
he contacted her on WhatsApp he she said um  

08:29
yeah let's set up a time to speak in the future 
and essentially what she did was she wanted to  

08:35
dismiss these rumors about her ex-husband of many 
many moons ago John Michelle trau and so I'm going  

08:41
to read this portion directly from Xavier 
P's book which is available on Amazon called  

08:47
becoming Brit and I want you to remember Xavier 
pussard is meticulous he has kept recordings  

08:53
of every single person that he spoke to along 
this 8-year investigation so from his book he  

08:59
writes this in first person so I was looking to 
contact veronique Drew what was the materiality  

09:05
of her marriage to Jean Michelle trogo who was 
he how and when had they parted after marrying  

09:12
a trogo veronique Drew continued her upward social 
Mobility by marrying a la Simone now listed in the  

09:20
batin mundan that is where I found her number I 
contacted on WhatsApp she agreed to get back to  

09:27
me the next day and did so our conversation 
lasted half an hour even though she repeats  

09:33
the wording often heard from the trogo Entourage 
example those women are crazy referring to Natasha  

09:39
Ray and amandine Roy she first pretends not to 
know what the call is about about Jean Michelle  

09:46
becoming brijit right listen sir I don't know it's 
ridiculous anyway because I have two children with  

09:53
Jean Michelle I saw on YouTube that they made a 
family tree where they even put that I might be  

09:59
macron's mother veronique Drew is of course 
referring to questions raised by internet  

10:04
users about The Uncanny physical resemblance 
between Emanuel macron the husband of bjit  

10:10
and Jean jaac trau the son of Jean Michelle 
trau she goes on says listen sir I have been  

10:17
divorced from Jean Michelle trno for many years 
listen sir I have remarried and my children are  

10:22
here I don't want any problems but I can tell you 
that Johan Michelle is not bit that's ridiculous  

10:30
I had uh two chocolate stores in bouet well I 
had I had two children it didn't work out so I  

10:36
went back to live with my mom and that's all but I 
can tell you that John Michelle is not bit Xavier  

10:45
says I take her at her word and I ask her for 
photos of her shared past with John Michelle trau  

10:52
promising that if they are conclusive to close 
the case without even publishing those photos  

11:01
ver Veron Drew says to him bit told me not to 
get involved I don't want any trouble about my  

11:07
children or about um it's not relevant to the 
family anymore okay so a couple of things that  

11:14
I want you to remember just to point out right 
there about that little correspondent she tells   Xavier that the divorce between her that after 
the divorce between her and John Michelle TR  

11:23
no she went to live with her mother okay she 
also stresses emphatically that bit is not  

11:29
Michelle trau but also that Brit told her not to 
get involved that's quite strange just off the bat  

11:35
that's strange because you have ch two children 
with her brother and you mean to tell me that it  

11:40
wasn't just your ex-husband John Michelle trau 
the person that you raised your children with  

11:45
uh who said anything to you but rather his former 
his sister his your former sister-in-law who told  

11:52
you not to get involved okay that seems a little 
strange I would I would expect her to say Jean  

11:57
Michelle chno told me not to get involved with 
this you guys are all crazy go away but okay   let's park by the side you want to live with 
your mom post divorce and for whatever reason  

12:06
for whatever reason you're listening to what bjit 
mcon is telling you to do rather than your should   be ex-husband who you've not mentioned in this 
conversation and who she does not mention in the  

12:15
capacity of her having a uh present relationship 
with a current relationship with okay so jumping  

12:21
back into Xavier's conversation back into first 
person he says this in his book as I Xavier argue  

12:28
that she should hold Bri mccon to account because 
it's because of her silence that her own photo as  

12:34
well as the photo of her children John Jack in 
particular are circulating on social networks  

12:40
she cuts me off and inexp inexplicably blurts out 
and also I know macron's father well I don't know  

12:48
him very well but he was a surgeon at the Aman 
hospital but I didn't know Emanuel macron we  

12:55
lived in tulah and I didn't even know him I saw 
him at my daughter's wedding the first time I had   ever seen him then I can hear another person on 
the Line veronique Drew stops visibly embarrassed  

13:06
as if she's gone too far she pulls herself 
together and asks me well and what is your name  

13:13
end of conversation so we are to Garner from this 
conversation that someone was in the room okay she  

13:19
said I will agree to speak with you and then there 
was someone in the room when she was having this   conversation with Xavier pussard that stopped her 
when she gave a random but very interesting tid  

13:29
that she knew Emanuel macron's Father John 
Michelle macron but she did not know anything  

13:36
of Emanuel mrrone until he appeared at her 
daughter Valerie's wedding and needless to  

13:43
say she never did provide Xavier pussard with any 
photos of her ex-husband or their strictly private  

13:50
wedding anything that could have immediately 
just dispelled these rumors uh these Missing   Years so to speak of his life and bit trag 
no's life that would have just put everything  

13:59
to bed they're never willing to do that right so 
afterwards Xavier pusar does what he does best  

14:06
he's investigated what she had told him okay was 
veronique the George S to brigit macron's chopan  

14:14
were they perhaps living together and did she 
maybe help Brit Brit macron eventually create  

14:22
an alibi for her past or was she telling the 
truth was everybody crazy and John Michelle  

14:27
trno was just her ex-husband and he's very well 
and alive he just can't speak to anybody right  

14:32
now well I can tell you that Xavier was able to 
determine that there was a very weird pattern   of behavior for veronique following her divorce 
from Jean Michelle trau namely that she refused to  

14:43
acknowledge her previous marriage to John Michelle 
trau even when it was required of her by laws okay  

14:52
for example in a tax document here it is that is 
dated in January of 1992 she listed that she had  

15:01
only previously been married once to a man named 
Serge Fran franch cha and by the way that's true  

15:08
she had first married Serge and then she married 
Jean Michelle trogo but of course she had two  

15:14
marriages and she leaves off jean Michelle trau 
she says I've only been married once that is a  

15:19
lie who Among Us would lie on a tax document it's 
a very uh uh scary territory right you don't want  

15:28
to be caught lying on tax documents and yet she 
did this she removed one of her marriages then she  

15:34
did it again in a public real estate Collective 
uh that she put together to purchase her house in  

15:40
Corsica I think it would be similar to putting 
your house in an LLC in 2018 she reported that  

15:46
she had actually never previously been married 
in a document that was issued by a notary okay  

15:52
she lied in the presence of a notary and again 
removed her marriage from Jean Michelle trau who  

15:59
was instructing her to essentially pretend that 
she had never been married to Jean Mel Chau UND  

16:05
document she just removed him for the rest of her 
life it seems everything that Xavier could find  

16:11
he was also able to determine through documents 
that she had lied to him over the phone when she  

16:17
said that following the divorce she went to live 
with her mother he was able to find records that  

16:22
revealed to him that actually she went to live 
in an apartment in Aman's that was owned by Jean  

16:29
Michelle trna's father so the trno family put her 
up in an apartment and I don't know I guess it's  

16:36
not totally strange that your father-in-law 
might do that but what is strange is that you   would lie about that years later when people 
start asking questions about your ex-husband  

16:47
okay very strange it's worth noting also that 
right around this time of their divorce okay  

16:53
so they're officially divorced in 1987 you can 
assume they separated sometime before that because  

16:59
to finally get your divorce stamped and done and 
sealed it usually takes a little longer maybe one  

17:05
year if you're going really quickly um but that's 
the time that Brit mcon the Brit mcon that we know  

17:12
okay the public record bit mccon that's when she 
be begins her very public and traceable career  

17:20
as a teacher okay she goes and enters in 1986 at 
the Lucy Berger School suddenly changes the career  

17:28
total career change and then this is all they want 
to show us oh look she was a teacher here and a  

17:34
teacher here and a teacher there and of course the 
uh the Future Love of her life Emanuel was just 9  

17:41
years old so it was just five more years five more 
years and then Brit mccon the one that we know uh  

17:49
will meet the love of his life oh did I say his 
love of her life this is a good time to tell you  

17:59
that most of what you think you even know about 
Emmanuel macron thus far his legacy yeah it's just  

18:07
objectively not true Emanuel had a major handup 
in life this guy so private we don't know much  

18:15
about him what we do know about him is I would say 
quite Sinister it's quite Sinister it's making me  

18:23
think I don't know of that movie The Manchurian 
Candidate I'll tell you guys about that after  

18:28
after a brief break from our sponsors I just want 
to thank preborn they've been our sponsors from  

18:33
the beginning of this podcast uh we know they 
are doing such great work Planned Parenthood   is spending Millions to Target vulnerable women 
who are being convinced uh that they should take  

18:43
the abortion pill because it's a quick and easy 
solution but what Planned Parenthood doesn't tell   these ladies is that there is a Devastation that 
follows there's pain there's regret there's the  

18:52
reality of having ended A Life That's why pre-born 
is stepping in through Innovative technology  

18:57
pre-born is reaching a determined women before 
they take that pill before it's too late in fact  

19:02
to date pre-born network of clinics has rescued 
over 300,000 babies and have seen over 90,000  

19:09
women come to Christ but it does not stop there 
pre-born network of clinics are with these moms  

19:14
every step of the way offering them counseling 
maternity supplies and the support that they need   to choose life but they cannot do it without us 
which is why uh just $28 will help to provide an  

19:24
ultrasound to a woman that is in crisis that is 
literally it $28 to help her to see her baby and  

19:30
choose life instead so if you'd like to donate you 
just dial pound 250 and say the keyword baby again  

19:36
that's pound 250 baby or you can donate securely 
at pre-born dcom Candace that's pre-born dcom  

19:43
Candace also reminding you about gold Co president 
Trump is back and that could be obviously great  

19:49
for gold and silver because under Trump's first 
term the price of gold soared 53% and the price  

19:54
of silver jumped 51% will gold continue to break 
records and 2025 and Beyond gold and silver have  

20:01
been used as a store of value for centuries as 
you very well know the government cannot easily   manipulate them and they are known as Hedges 
against Market risk and inflation and that's  

20:10
why I personally bought gold and silver from my 
great Partners at Gold Co goldco is a toppr rated  

20:15
precious metals company they have supported 
the show from the beginning like I said and   they have helped hardworking Americans purchase 
over $3 billion in gold and silver they know what  

20:24
they're doing so right now you can get a free 
copy of their 2025 gold and silver k on top of  

20:29
that you could also qualify for up to $115,000 in 
bonus silver possibly even more so to learn more  

20:34
head over to Candace likes gold.com again that's 
Candace likes gold.com all right so regarding  

20:42
Emanuel macron we may have accidentally told you 
some lies I don't know we've been telling you   what the media has said about him and the media 
has definitely been spinning some tales about  

20:51
him painting him as as this mosart virtuoso just 
ahead of his time trying to uh I don't know make  

20:57
everybody aqu yes to this story that is at best 
a story of stat statutory rape and could still be  

21:05
prosecuted by the way until the end of this year 
which would be fascinating but yeah the Press told  

21:11
everybody he was just just this amazingly gifted 
writer who also loved to play sh chopan for fit on  

21:18
the piano okay cool um from Xavier's book in 2020 
the myth of the writer macron was definitively  

21:27
debunked by a journal like they kept saying that 
he would write these novels and Brit would talk   about his passion for writing and interviews well 
essentially they realized that uh nope that isn't  

21:39
true none of that is true and it they created 
this idea of him really just because they wanted  

21:46
the public to believe that he was this genius and 
that he therefore deserved uh to be suddenly in  

21:53
the midst as a politician that he had had this 
background where he was kind of a boy genius  

21:58
and like I said that could not be further from 
the truth the reality is Emanuel macron's real  

22:05
story is more of a fake it till you make it 
okay if that's how how you would say it fake  

22:10
it till you make it as we have stressed before 
not much has known about his childhood okay it's  

22:15
weird just gets very strange his mother we now 
know was in charge of the gender reassignment  

22:21
program at the Social Security office his 
father was a psychiatrist but according to  

22:28
veronique she had no memory of Emanuel having 
been around him his grandmother manette we know  

22:35
definitely was involved in his childhood it's 
the only one he speaks about affectionately or   or even relates to his childhood in his book we 
also know that Grandma had a knack for pedophile  

22:44
Centric books it was Grandma's thing what are 
you going do she likes these like pedophile   Centric books she's just like hey is that a 
past yeah that's a really cool thing let's  

22:53
talk about Andre GED let's talk about it let's 
talk about all of these weird passages me and my  

22:58
grandchild we share this with one another like 
I said we learned that he was a bit of a loner  

23:04
he didn't have many friends the friends people 
that went to school with him didn't even know   what his parents did well according to the 
Wall Street journal's book The calculated  

23:14
rise of macron it was the Roth's child family the 
Roth's child bank that had everything to do with  

23:22
his professional resume and interestingly 
uh enough Xavier pussard had discovered  

23:29
that the bank made an internal error in 
their documents when they listed macron  

23:35
who is supposed to be born in Aman as having 
instead been born in Paris and they made this  

23:43
error on multiple documents by the way I'm going 
to show you a few of them uh and the reality is  

23:49
of course this keeps coming up that we are told 
in the official biography that he's born in Aman  

23:54
then we have the former mayor of Aman who said no 
he's uh what was it Tua like from L tuet area now  

24:04
we have the Rothchilds reporting that he's born 
in Paris and we just don't know what's real and  

24:09
what's false okay we really don't know but we do 
have this uh from the uh rotha Bank minutes here  

24:17
it says he is born n 21 December 1977 a and they 
do this again and they just keep making this ut  

24:26
oh mistake that he's born in Paris but but it must 
have been a clerical error now Emanuel himself has  

24:32
never denied his closeness with the Rothchilds in 
fact he said this in 2012 and I quote I had a very  

24:42
unintelligible background no one could understand 
me outside of Roth's child okay and when he became  

24:50
the economic advisor to the Socialist president 
franois haland he said that David daro's child  

25:08
you're going to be his protector when you get into 
Power I'm going to tell you read you this passage  

25:13
uh regarding him climbing the ladder at the 
rothshild bank because it apparently his rise made  

25:21
no sense to his colleagues this is from Xavier's 
Book quote within the bank Emanuel macron's  

25:28
progress surprised many Sarah Haro explained that 
he quote had been identified as a very singular  

25:36
personality with a lot of contacts and Sophie 
Javari who trained him at Rothchild and Co reports  

25:44
that he quote had very highlevel contacts for our 
files with links to the state end quote according  

25:52
to her her most experienced colleagues were 
surprised by his quote supports at the top level  

25:59
of the bank notably David der rooth's child and 
his right-hand man Francois henro who occasionally  

26:07
allowed him to quote bypass his immediate 
hierarchy this support enabled him to become  

26:14
at the age of 32 the youngest managing partner in 
the bank's history even though according to other  

26:22
employees he was a poor technician quote macron 
doesn't know much about it quote in meetings we  

26:30
Giggle and think ardently here's another mrrone 
gem now reporting on other confidences from  

26:38
Rothchild and co- Executives journalist Mark endal 
confirms the bitterness aroused by his accelerated  

26:45
promotion quote at Rothchild he has the reputation 
of never having written an equation he didn't  

26:54
even know what iida is the operating profit of a 
company David dchild had to quote violate them to  

27:04
appoint him to managing partner okay the idea of 
a managing partner of rtha Bank not knowing what  

27:13
iida stands for like that I mean it's I mean I'm I 
I'm not a financial institution over here earnings  

27:20
before interest in tax he didn't know what that 
was and so people around Rothchild who watched his  

27:28
rise and were bitter about it and knew that David 
D rild had a hand in this again you can read about  

27:33
this in the Wall Street journals book you can read 
about this in Mark endals book The ambiguous past  

27:39
of macron people don't understand how he was just 
sort of elevated at this bank and by the way that  

27:46
elevation actually took place before he even got 
to the rosch's bank it also took place in school  

27:54
so we were told he was Mozart right we were told 
that this kid just had it he just was so brilliant  

28:01
then you're going to find this other point to be 
quite odd in 2002 when he was 25 years old Emanuel  

28:07
macron was admitted into Ena that's that's a 
school it's basically the national school of  

28:13
administration a Hyper Elite French graduate 
program this the best way for me to explain it  

28:18
to English listeners okay okay yet he failed entry 
into this school twice and then he was magically  

28:27
admitted without having to answer the question 
that was asked during the oral exam that's a  

28:33
component of getting into this school this Elite 
School essentially you have to attend to get like  

28:39
a highlevel job as a financial executive they 
just allowed him to be admitted without doing  

28:45
the oral exam like like that's ever been done 
before okay then somehow he ends up at in the  

28:51
top rankings of his class and is able to join the 
inspector generals of finances and his Co students  

29:01
around him his Co colleagues around him knew 
clearly knew that he was an idiot and that that  

29:07
meant that the rankings were cooked so there was 
public bash backlash amongst the other students  

29:12
within his year they literally mobilized against 
their fraudulent results which then led to the  

29:18
Council of the state having having to intervene 
and cancel the school rankings for that year for  

29:25
the first time in the school's history okay for 
the first time in the school's history could you   imagine this like an NBA program you're like this 
kid's an idiot I don't even know he got here and  

29:34
then they released the wanking like actually he 
the smartest kid in the class and then they all   went okay what is going on here clearly this is 
cooked this is completely cooked and they get  

29:44
they get the council involved the state Council 
involved and they go you know what how about just   no results this year like what what a quick little 
point on that by the way is that in 2021 when he  

29:55
man mome was President he decided to essentially 
cancel the ENA he's like oh we actually need more  

30:01
diversity in banking so we shouldn't even have 
this this this program this is this is ridiculous  

30:07
this is crazy we just need to have more diversity 
yeah okay buddy I'm sure that's what it is sounds  

30:13
like maybe your entire career you were just being 
prepared for this moment this moment of becoming  

30:20
the president of France and you actually what you 
are is the only thing we can verify which is a   drama student you know how to act you know how to 
act and pretend that you are the president while  

30:30
there is clearly somebody behind you that has been 
moving you all through life another odd point was  

30:36
that when he was admitted into the Roth's child 
Bank in 2008 he was supposed to have publicized  

30:42
an order from the minister which granted him leave 
from compulsory civil service for whatever reason  

30:49
he was exempt from that compulsory procedure so 
he didn't even have to reinstate his Civil Service  

30:55
when he then left the bank and was magically 
appointed right to president Holland's team as  

31:01
an economic adviser like what in fact the deputy 
chairman of the council for state legal ethics  

31:07
spoke out about this he remarked that he had never 
seen anything like it he had never seen someone  

31:14
given an exemption on this not having to go by 
certain steps I'm sure just like the students at  

31:20
the ENA had never seen someone who couldn't even 
get into the school who clearly was not at the  

31:26
top of the class magically be awarded and being 
told like actually that's the brightest kid in  

31:31
the class actually here we go they were outraged 
and they should have been outraged and the people  

31:37
that work with at Rothchild Banks were similarly 
outraged this guy doesn't even know what iida is   it sounds like actually he's an idiot he's an 
idiot when it comes to finances and he probably  

31:47
could not wax poetic about anything and he is 
just performative it makes me think of the story  

31:53
of that politician when he's talking about uh uh 
Pyrenees peran oh my grandmother is she you know  

32:01
all that my great-grandparents wanted was for her 
to learn French you know and cuz she only spoke  

32:08
penan and he's like that's not a language not a 
language that's why I say this reminds me of the  

32:16
murrian candidate now regarding the Rothschild's 
family there is so much that I could say here but  

32:24
I do not want this episode to get hit on YouTube 
suffice it to say you could look up any of them  

32:30
uh The Proven ties to Jeffrey Epstein the various 
pedophilic and incest scandals which are abound  

32:39
and have surrounded this family um you could 
look up anything but know that any journalist  

32:46
who begins to write about this in France has 
to face anti-em catism charges right you can't  

32:52
oh gosh God forbid you actually report on facts 
pertaining to the Rothschild's family and their  

32:58
empire what we'll do instead here is leave you 
with what Xavier pussard said because I think  

33:05
he summed it up quite brilliantly regarding the 
Rothchilds he wrote notoriously the roths child's  

33:12
longevity and preservation of their Fortune are 
based on an extensive practice of endogamy and  

33:20
alliances between cousins essentially inter 
breeding at a conference at the museum of art  

33:28
history Natalie Reams David deroth child's 
cousin went further declaring quote a very  

33:35
common practice in such families Vice is nice but 
incest is best because it stays in the family we  

33:43
are simply raised to be silent so that nothing 
comes out we are brought up with this weight to  

33:50
make sure and it works that we never speak out 
Xavier concludes by saying words that Echo what we  

33:57
encountered throughout our investigation of Brit 
a family cloistered in silence jealous to protect  

34:04
a family secret zealous to protect a family 
secret that has become a state Affair and I am  

34:11
telling you on that closing chapter regarding the 
Rothchilds and the scandals abound uh including  

34:18
scandals that pertain to David D Roth's child you 
will want to P pick up Xavier Bard's book becoming  

34:24
prit because what I have given you thus far is 
truly the tip of the iceberg I cannot explain to  

34:30
you how many uh pedophile scandals I have removed 
from this podcasting again because I'm going this  

34:38
is on YouTube so I have to make this as rated 
G as I possibly can it cannot continually be  

34:47
the case that these are all just coin inces okay 
there's just way too many coincidences adding up  

34:54
you can't play the all my homies are pedophiles 
and trans except for me card I don't know I just  

35:00
would feel a little bit weird about that right 
if you just had an individual in your life you're   like I swear everyone around me is involved in 
this but it's not me right that's kind of what  

35:11
Emanuel mrrone is trying to sell to us right now 
everyone's involved and all this stuff but not me  

35:16
I now look at him having come out of that book 
and I think he's an idiot he's just a puet and   he has been groomed from the time that he was a 
child but groomed by who who is his father who is  

35:28
his father if if people if he doesn't have this 
relationship with Shan Michelle and we found out   all throughout this affair that he doesn't really 
seem to have close relations with his parents or  

35:40
these his doctors perhaps I don't know you can ask 
pointed questions to them but they don't want to  

35:45
answer any of these questions because they know 
that we have figured out the game and the game is   is that you have to be very precise in how you ask 
them questions because they can change identities  

35:57
and they can change names the family has this 
capacity so if you are wondering the answer to  

36:03
why it is that Xavier pussard has never been sued 
by the macron family uh what is it exactly that  

36:10
saved Xavier pussard whereas the women Natasha Ray 
and almandine Roy who did wonderful work ended up  

36:16
getting sued for little mistakes the answer is 
actually kind of funny because it kind of boils   down to the differences between men and women so 
I would say that men women first and foremost tend  

36:27
to be more intuitive we are more intuitive we 
go with our guts I say this all the time to my   husband this person just gives me a bad Vibe 
I don't trust this person I tend to go with my  

36:37
gut a lot more I do believe that we we have God's 
intuition especially when it comes to our children  

36:43
but men tend to be a bit more technical right 
where they will just need to mathematically Ute  

36:50
something to be sure about something and they'll 
question things and maybe not go with their gut   all the time or go with their gut at all and 
so that is really what happened with Natasha  

37:00
Ray and Xavier pussard so Xavier pussard used a 
technology I mentioned it to you on last uh last  

37:07
week's episode or a couple days ago on the episode 
but I want to to demonstrate that technology for   you because when he said it to me my my my girl 
brain just sort of went okay I'm not into AI  

37:17
I'm not into Tech but then when he explained to 
me that that this this technology known as face   Plus+ is basically the world economic forums has 
has listed it amongst its 11 smartest companies  

37:30
okay uh it is headquartered in Beijing China as 
I mentioned to you it is what China uses as their  

37:36
software for facial recognition and when he showed 
me how accurate it is I was positively shocked I  

37:43
genuinely shocked amazed and then terrified about 
the direction of the world when you think about  

37:48
these globalists who I believe want to turn us 
into like sort of these technological slaves and   recognizing that this artificial intelligence is 
bang on accurate and so yes this it's valued at  

38:01
$1 billion from the WF website it tells us that 
it was founded in 2011 um and it is a leader in  

38:09
Machinery visual artificial intelligence industry 
and face recognition systems so I want to show you  

38:15
like just as he was showing me this technology 
and I was kind of testing it to see if it could  

38:21
get something wrong just how accurate it could be 
because we now live in an age of plastic surgery  

38:26
right women can literally change their faces and 
the fact that this technology is still able to  

38:33
process who that person is is amazing to me so 
here's an example and this is also featured in   his book but um I want to point out Kim Bassinger 
there on the right who has modified her face a  

38:45
lot okay it still knows it is looking and it is 
saying yeah no that's still can Bassinger and it  

38:52
comes back with a percentage and it's telling 
you essentially you get into the 75% range you   get above 70% and and it is very high like yes 
we are certain that that is her and it is her  

39:04
it is accurately her um I'm also going to show you 
that it is able even to take a childhood photo and  

39:11
even though that might make it lower or decrease 
and you may not get into the 70 range you may get  

39:17
into the high 60 range it is still able to tell 
you that yes this is the correct person so you're  

39:23
seeing here uh Shirley Temple on the bottom there 
Hillary Clinton I mean her her face really hasn't  

39:28
changed much from the time that she was a child 
with 78% confidence um on the top there of course  

39:34
you've got Princess Diana uh you've got the queen 
it's able to come back and to say to you despite  

39:41
all of this time and age that this is the same 
person which is incredible like I said then here  

39:49
this is the Reason by the way which to me I 
would have been if I had to to place a bet on  

39:55
a horse I would have bet on Natasha Ray and 
her instincts when she first saw that photo  

40:02
of Andre Lis Andre Lewis at his wedding and 
then she found out that he had a cousin who  

40:08
was named John Lise okay so just looking at 
this photo on the left there is the wedding  

40:14
photo obviously the groom on the right there 
is his cousin that's John Louise so these are  

40:20
I would have thought the same person so she looked 
at this photo and she's like uh no I actually   think that the person in the photo is this guy 
and I think that they're playing us and that if  

40:30
I had just looked at these photos and trusted 
my own eyes I would have totally co-signed to  

40:36
what Natasha Ray said that looks to be the exact 
same person but Xavier pussard so Natasha said  

40:43
that or wrote that and she got sued for defamation 
Xavier pussard instead ran these two photos in his  

40:49
technology and it told him no it said it's not the 
same person in face Plus+ it came back 52% low so  

40:59
he said okay I must be missing something this 
I'm going to rely on technology it's telling me   that these are two different people and they look 
so much these first cousins look a lot alike but  

41:07
the technology picked it up and of course we then 
learned as we covered yesterday or two days ago  

41:13
rather that it it actually was a different person 
that that John Luiz oier was a a first cousin  

41:19
he was not in fact the same person that was 
pictured there which is the reason that she   got sued for defamation again not attacking the 
substance of her claims not attacking whether  

41:28
or not Brit had transitioned from Jean Michelle 
trau rather attacking an error that is going to  

41:33
happen as you're investigating a story and when 
people are refusing to give you any answers and   in many times intentionally sending you down 
the wrong path right so regarding brijit mcon  

41:46
who has now changed her face as we learned 
we know that she's seeing this doctor she's  

41:52
getting feminization surgery this is a good way 
and plus she's now in her 80s right and we've got  

42:00
only pictures from her childhood uh only pictures 
of Jean Michelle trno from his childhood when you  

42:07
compare this with the tech the tech returns this 
way it tells us that this is a high probability  

42:15
and this is with dentur teeth different teeth 
right it is is telling us that this is this is  

42:22
this boy in this school photo okay this is this 
boy in this school photo it is returning from  

42:29
normal to high highest being there at 17.3% and 
that's just with the school photo and with years  

42:39
of work okay we're not even comparing this to the 
school photos when she still had the teeth that   you see there on the left hand side right when 
bit still had teeth this is with a ton of work  

42:50
being done by the magician to the transgendered 
Community right the guy that can make you a woman  

42:56
he looks at you looks at women like their clay 
and it is still certain that that is brigit mcon  

43:03
okay that that little boy became Brit macron it 
is also certain that the woman in the wedding  

43:10
photo so more aged on Brit trno who married Andre 
Lewis is not the first lady brijit macron that we  

43:19
today it is returning low probability that these 
are the same people what's going on here what do  

43:26
you mean it's returning low probability this 
maybe gives us the answer to why she will not  

43:31
answer she will not join a lawsuit and assert 
formally by just saying that is me in the photo  

43:38
okay she will not answer my questions as we've 
had our legal team go out and we have said we   don't want to lie just like Xavier we're not here 
in the business to spread lies okay doesn't help  

43:47
me doesn't make my audience want to come back to 
my show when I get busted intentionally lying and   defaming someone for the sheer sport of it help me 
help you Brit is this you in the wedding photo she  

43:58
doesn't want to answer that question okay well if 
we turn to AI technology the reason why she's not   answering that question is because it's not her in 
the photo okay that is somebody else that somebody  

44:08
else went by the name brijit trogo that's very 
interesting John Michelle trogo at that wedding  

44:14
we're not allowed to see any photos of him at 
that wedding because apparently all photos have   been destroyed other than two lingering photos of 
the uh of Andre Lise Andre Lewis and same for bit  

44:28
trau we are just finding that despite all photos 
that should be made available we can't even get  

44:33
our hands on school photos School photos we just 
they don't want to give them they don't want to  

44:40
give them up the nothing exists it's just all been 
deleted a whole person just got deleted okay and  

44:47
regarding the communion photo which we instantly 
looked at and said it looks nothing like the first  

44:52
lady I'm looking at my eyes it returns this answer 
the text says no again low nope not happening  

45:02
sorry ain't her okay so what do we discern from 
that what we discern from that is that the photos  

45:11
that Mimi Mar best image agency Mimi marshan 
who's up with the gangsters doing work making  

45:19
sure that pedophile scandals don't hit the Press 
disgusting pedophile scandals she's stopping that  

45:26
from hitting the Press she's she's the popess of 
the celebrity media doesn't print without her say  

45:32
so the person that documentary filmmakers have 
to go through to get any images of the first lady  

45:38
and then when they get these images there are a 
few and far between what three entered into the  

45:43
public Arena of her childhood and all of those 
photos one or two from her childhood rather and  

45:51
one from her uh marriage alleged marriage well 
Chinese tech software sanctioned by the wef as  

46:01
the best in the game is telling us that that is 
not the current first lady of France what are we  

46:09
to make of that what are we to make of that the 
silence the punking the intimidation techniques  

46:17
going after people for taxes is sending the 
figurative or the French IRS to go after people  

46:23
when they can't get him on defamation uh going 
after trying to figure out who's funding people  

46:29
us having had as we did in the past our interview 
with Xavier pussard taken down from YouTube for  

46:35
weird reasons demanding censorship accusing Xavier 
pussard of anti-Semitism for an article that he  

46:41
wrote had nothing to do nothing to do by the way 
with anything pertaining to brijit mcon but he  

46:47
said article he wrote 5 years ago about the power 
who controls all the media in France they're get  

46:54
they're coming after him for anti-Semitism he 
didn't even say these people are Jewish he just   wrote the names of the people who have power in 
the media in France they're looking for anything  

47:05
as opposed to just what showing us photos of your 
life married to Andre Lewis are you going to tell  

47:11
us that that has similarly also been destroyed 
or are we to make of this that the person  

47:19
that is living in the El Palace the person who 
definitively groomed the president who actually  

47:27
has not been so honest about his background 
who is not the genius virtuoso that has been   presented to the public Brit mccrone perhaps 
is Jean Michelle trno Jean Michelle trog no  

47:43
who during a transition the picture that I'm 
seeing right now and I'm happy to correct it   again because I know you guys are watching at 
the L Palace please just answer our 21 questions  

47:53
because the picture that I'm getting from all of 
this and again we have not even gotten to Xavier   P's explosive interview is that something 
happened in the 80s something happened in  

48:03
the mid-70s and the 80s veronique veronique 
Drew Jean Michelle trau your reappearance in  

48:09
1986 as a teacher the lies that you have told 
sexy Claudia shiffer she didn't exist then I  

48:16
don't see a woman with legs irresistible that the 
young boys just couldn't wait oh my God look at  

48:24
that what are you talking about who sanctioned 
these lies in the Press who are you really and  

48:32
what is your relationship to Emanuel macron what 
is Emanuel marron's relationship to you what is  

48:37
the relationship between Emanuel Marron and Jean 
Jack it's not feeling like a nephew to me I don't  

48:43
know something feels off there when I look at 
that picture something feels very wrong there  

48:49
of course it's so simple to answer these questions 
and yet you refuse to you go so far as to try to  

48:55
intimidate an American journalist and I got to 
tell you it doesn't make you look anything but  

49:00
extremely guilty that's what I will say about that 
topic I'm now going to before I get into a few of  

49:09
your comments um remind you guys about American 
financing because I know the average person finds  

49:14
it difficult to keep up with monthly expenses in 
most cases there is little left at the end of the   month to cover any extras most Americans aren't 
getting a big raise expenses are up and it is  

49:23
very hard to manage without using credit cards

obligation call today to my friends in American

so we are going to Premiere the Xavier pussard  

50:12
interview I wanted to do one more episode of this 
because there are things that he was speaking   about that I wanted to make sense to you when he 
talks about the s software that has really saved  

50:20
him um from making any errors or or making any 
assumptions that would have given them the ability  

50:27
to pounce and so uh we will Premiere the first 
part of the interview here on YouTube and then  

50:32
we will put the rest of it on CandaceOwens.com 
uh which is running and amazing thanks to Patmos  

50:39
which is the great team that put together um our 
website they are the most trusted alternative to  

50:45
Big Tech hosting and their service is excellent 
the hosting is secure and I'm now officially free  

50:50
to say anything that I want on the show without 
the fear of being cancelled uh by my web host so  

50:56
we're grateful to Patmos Patmos.tech if you're 
one of those individuals who is looking for   that freedom as well you can make the switch and 
have them host things for you at Patmos.tech all  

51:07
right let's get into some of your comments I know 
some of you guys actually brought the uh bought  

51:13
the book already Xavier P's book uh becoming 
brijit and you've skipped and learned more and  

51:18
like I said I didn't I have not even scratched the 
surface and so after we show you our interview we  

51:23
will then get into even more because you will have 
questions about who they are now trying to go back  

51:30
and present and suggest could be Jean Michelle 
trno those of you who have gotten there about  

51:36
the uh little chubby guy that they're trying to 
say Shan Michelle trno who curiously didn't stand  

51:41
with his family at the inauguration but stood with 
the Rothchilds um we'll get into all of that uh  

51:49
in an episode after the interview with Xavier so 
that you can put that piece together suffice it to  

51:55
say the AI Tech says no that is not John Michelle 
trog no this person de hend writes Candace shame  

52:03
on you for sending me down this rabbit hole with 
you for truth because now I'm all in something is   definitely fishy about Mr first gentleman briet 
mccrone the gig is up I agree Christine writes  

52:14
thank you cace for who you are and all that you 
do Chris writes you may remember me from earlier   during the year for finding a beautiful Bi Bible 
on the ground while walking my dog I attended  

52:23
my first Catholic mass this morning and wanted 
to share thanks for helping me find Christ God   bless you such an amazing amazing story Jessica 
Wickers writes I am loving these investigative  

52:31
series your thoroughness is amazing with baby 
number four on the way and given your previous   Hospital experiences are you planning a home birth 
or are you working with a midwife I am I would be  

52:42
very happy if I had my baby at home my husband 
won't let me plan that uh he's like everything's  

52:47
been smooth you have very easy pregnancy and 
we've had good births I did have one very bad   Hospital experience and we ended up checking 
my baby out of there that was really more over  

52:55
vaccines and Medicine rather than like my birth 
actual experience um and so he doesn't want to  

53:01
switch up the formula we're at odds there but I 
would love to give birth at home so I may just go   into labor and not tell him until the baby's just 
about to come out uh sis holiday writes point of  

53:12
V point of view me asking everyone in my life did 
you know the Pres of France's wife is a man yeah  

53:18
you know what's interesting is now now you go back 
when I first got into the story and I announced   it on my previous podcast and the journalists 
that instantly rushed to call it insane those  

53:27
are people that you should be very concerned of 
I call out Barry Weiss all the time because she   wrote like a whole article about me people were 
trying to use like Sigman Freud uh psychology to  

53:39
be like oh she must be having a mental breakdown 
could you imagine the trying to assign hysteria to  

53:45
someone who's looking into a story of perversion 
and pedophilia and grooming what does that tell  

53:51
you about our mainstream media apparatus it should 
tell you that they do not work for the people they  

53:56
work to protect the state and whoever is running 
the state and this is a story like I said that is  

54:02
global um I think there are two many similarities 
between the upbringing of um Emanuel macron and as  

54:09
we talked about the upbringing of Camala Camala 
Harris the upbringing of Barack Obama you know  

54:15
these people being raised by their grandparents at 
a time when we know that the MK Ultra program was  

54:20
running and there is something very very wrong 
there too many comparisons is what I would say  

54:28
Luke writes dig dig and dig find out who is hiding 
behind this person 47 versus a 14-year-old not  

54:35
okay what is going on with the elites this is 
bad uh she was uh you meant to say 37 uh sorry  

54:42
she was 14 she was 39 Christian foron writes our 
sincere salutation to Emanuel mcon bit mcon John  

54:50
Michelle trno lilan de Rothchild pedophine oier 
and JJ trno who are all one way or another with  

54:58
us tonight indeed they are um I'm hearing rumors 
that he Emanuel mcon is e e even looking at trying  

55:05
to hire people in public relations uh to deal 
with the fracturing of his image and tifon is  

55:14
quiet I've got a lot of questions about her the 
only child that seems to really speak out and  

55:20
it's interesting because we like I said don't 
know what happened to brijit trau but we know  

55:26
that whatever did happen to the real brijit trno 
um tfon would have been too young to remember her  

55:32
so I find that to be of some interest and that's 
why we have created a timeline which we should   share with you all so that you can just capture 
kind of the movements here like a timeline of  

55:42
rajit trno a timeline of Johan Michelle trno sort 
of like the wiping and the disappearing of them   both the reemergence of rajit uh oier or later 
to be Mone is just it's too perfect of a story  

55:57
when you start to look at it but anyways you guys 
just reminding you if you want to support our work   please go to canis ens.com you can give whatever 
you want you can also sign up we have an entire  

56:06
series on vaccines uh you can also support by 
buying my sophomore book which is available for  

56:11
pre-sale uh head to CandaceOwens.com there's so 
many ways to support independent journalists and  

56:17
uh people that are just taking these risks and 
telling these stories because I do think that   we're experiencing this Global Awakening and 
we are realizing that something very dark and  

56:24
something very perverse is going on and that 
there are too many powers that are trying to  

56:29
suppress us having that conversation and it's 
going to take all of us kind of supporting one  

56:35
another and educating one another in order for us 
to realistically be able to change things for our  

56:40
children and that's my investment in this by the 
way that's my skin in this game is that I've got   kids that have to grow up in this world and the 
more that I learn about things that have happened  

56:48
and things that are are happening it terrifies me 
uh and so I uh don't keep my mouth shut how am I  

56:53
doing Emanuel mcon I'm shutting up you did tell me 
to shut up pretty much in a lot of words in a 100   Pages you said don't say anything and I did not 
not say anything I failed really bad at not saying  

57:06
anything I'm I'm just not good at that it's not 
my thing anyways you guys we will see you tomorrow
