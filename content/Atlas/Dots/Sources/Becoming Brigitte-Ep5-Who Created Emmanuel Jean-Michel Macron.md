# Detailed Summary of the Episode

This episode of Becoming Brigitte marks a significant escalation in Candace Owens‚Äô investigative series. Following Alexandre Benalla‚Äôs unexpected Instagram follow, Owens dives deeper into the identity mystery surrounding Brigitte Macron, focusing on the 1977 "V√©ronique" interview, Jean-Michel Trogneux‚Äôs marriage to V√©ronique Dru, and Emmanuel Macron‚Äôs questionable rise with Rothschild ties. The episode blends new evidence, AI analysis, and viewer engagement, positioning Owens as a relentless truth-seeker against elite suppression, with sponsorships and a teased Xavier Poussard interview adding layers to the narrative.

## Introduction and Benalla‚Äôs Engagement

- Benalla‚Äôs Follow: Owens reveals [[Alexandre Benalla]], Macron‚Äôs former deputy chief of staff, began following her on Instagram two days prior, interpreting it as a deliberate signal given her public profile. She slid into his DMs, inviting him to join the series, but he left it ‚Äúseen‚Äù 12 hours ago, prompting her to await a response while emphasizing her commitment to fair representation.
- Context: This follows last week‚Äôs discussion of Benalla‚Äôs scandals (beating protesters, Russian ties), framing his follow as a potential acknowledgment of the series‚Äô impact.

## Revisiting the V√©ronique Interview

- Recap: Owens revisits the 1977 interview with "V√©ronique," a transitioning individual with Brigitte Macron‚Äôs voice and ‚Äúthat is to say‚Äù tick, confirmed by AI as the same person aged over time. Last episode‚Äôs focus was expanded to highlight V√©ronique‚Äôs admission of living with a woman ‚Äúin the style of George Sand and Chopin,‚Äù suggesting a partner or alibi.
- Significance: This aligns with Jean-Michel Trogneux‚Äôs life, raising questions about his transition and Brigitte‚Äôs identity, with V√©ronique‚Äôs intellectual references (Chopin, Verlaine, Rimbaud) mirroring the Macrons‚Äô public persona.

## Jean-Michel Trogneux‚Äôs Marriage and Family

- 1980 Wedding: Jean-Michel married V√©ronique Dru on November 24, 1980, in Blan Trv, with Brigitte as the sole witness. The union, announced post-event in L‚ÄôAuver Pion√©, occurred in ‚Äústrictest privacy,‚Äù echoing Tiphaine‚Äôs description of Andr√©-Louis Auzi√®re‚Äôs funeral.
- Children: The couple had Jean-Jacques Trogneux in 1982 (resembling Emmanuel) and Val√©rie Trogneux in 1984. Their 1987 divorce was followed by V√©ronique‚Äôs remarriage to Alain de la Simone in 1998, adopting a lavish lifestyle.
- Disappearance: Jean-Michel‚Äôs photographic trail ends post-1987, coinciding with Brigitte‚Äôs traceable teaching career starting in 1986, suggesting a deliberate erasure.

## V√©ronique Dru‚Äôs Interview and Lies

- Xavier Poussard‚Äôs Contact: Journalist Xavier Poussard interviewed V√©ronique Dru, who dismissed rumors of Jean-Michel transitioning into Brigitte, citing two children (Jean-Jacques, Val√©rie) and no knowledge of Emmanuel until Val√©rie‚Äôs wedding. She claimed post-divorce life with her mother, but records show she lived in a Trogneux-owned Amiens apartment.
- Documentary Evidence: V√©ronique lied on a 1992 tax document (listing only Serge Franch as a prior husband) and a 2018 Corsica property document (claiming no prior marriages), indicating a pattern of concealing her marriage to Jean-Michel.
- Interruption: During the call, someone else‚Äôs presence stopped V√©ronique after she mentioned knowing Macron‚Äôs father, Jean-Michel Macron, adding intrigue about family suppression.

## Emmanuel Macron‚Äôs Dubious Rise

- Myth Debunked: The 2020 debunking of Macron as a writer (no novels, despite claims) is revisited, with his persona as a Mozart virtuoso and Chopin lover exposed as fabricated, possibly to justify his statutory rape relationship with Brigitte.
- ENA and Rothschild Ties: Macron failed ENA entry twice but was admitted in 2002 without an oral exam, with cooked rankings prompting a 2021 cancellation. At Rothschild Bank (2008), he rose to managing partner by 32 despite financial ignorance, aided by David de Rothschild‚Äôs intervention, bypassing norms.
- Rothschild Influence: Bank documents mistakenly list his birth in Paris (not Amiens), and Macron admitted in 2012 to Rothschild‚Äôs pivotal role, with executives noting his high-level contacts and poor technical skills.

## AI Technology and Identity Analysis

- Face++ Introduction: Owens showcases Face++, a Beijing-based AI ranked by the World Economic Forum as a top facial recognition tool, used by China for social credit. It accurately identifies altered faces (e.g., Kim Basinger, Shirley Temple) with high confidence (70%+).
- Application to Case: Face++ confirms low probability (e.g., 52%) that Andr√©-Louis‚Äôs cousin Jean-Louis Auzi√®re is the wedding groom, vindicating Poussard over Natasha Ray‚Äôs sued mistake. It also suggests Jean-Michel‚Äôs school photo matches Brigitte‚Äôs current image (17.3% with modifications), while the wedding and communion photos don‚Äôt align with her, supporting a transition theory.
- Implications: Owens expresses unease about AI‚Äôs globalist potential but credits it for precision in avoiding defamation traps.

## The Rothschild Connection and Elite Grooming

- Scandals: Owens alludes to Rothschild ties to Jeffrey Epstein and incest/endogamy practices, citing Natalie Reims‚Äô confession of family silence, linking it to a state-protected secret.
- Macron‚Äôs Grooming: His loner childhood, grandmother Manette‚Äôs pedophile-centric book interest, and lack of parental closeness suggest MKUltra-like manipulation, paralleling Kamala Harris and Barack Obama‚Äôs upbringings.
- Suppression: Anti-Semitism charges against Poussard for unrelated media critiques highlight efforts to silence investigation.

# Overall Narrative

This episode advances Owens‚Äô theory that Jean-Michel Trogneux transitioned into Brigitte Macron, supported by the "V√©ronique" interview, V√©ronique Dru‚Äôs lies, and Face++ analysis, with Jean-Jacques‚Äô resemblance adding weight. Macron‚Äôs groomed rise, Rothschild backing, and ENA irregularities suggest elite manipulation, while suppression efforts (Benalla‚Äôs follow, media attacks) fuel suspicion. Owens positions herself as a courageous exposer of a dark agenda, bolstered by AI, viewer support, and her platform, promising deeper revelations with Poussard.

00:00
all right ladies and gentlemen so we knew¬†
that Emanuel macron and breit were watching¬†¬† this series but I am so pleased to report¬†
that so is their surrounding cast or their¬†¬†

00:09
former surrounding cast I guess last week¬†
we discussed Alexander banala I introduced¬†¬†

00:14
him to you their former deputy chief of staff¬†
who was caught impersonating a police officer¬†¬†

00:20
and kind of beating the living heck out¬†
of protesters in the street well guess¬†¬† what two days later that young gentleman¬†
began following me on Instagram I say the¬†¬†

00:29
more marrier so welcome back hello Alexander¬†
panala welcome back to our series becoming

00:35
Brit honestly I couldn't believe it when I saw¬†
it it was like a priority um note on my Instagram¬†¬†

00:57
it's like Alexander Bala started following you¬†
and I was like whoo okay obviously whoo what's¬†¬†

01:03
the meaning of this I'm not exactly sure what the¬†
purpose of the follow was given the fact that my¬†¬†

01:09
profile is public so you don't have to follow me¬†
you can just look at my profile privately I take¬†¬†

01:16
it that he wanted me to know that he was following¬†
me but you guys know me I never squander away an¬†¬†

01:22
opportunity so I basically hit him up in his DMs¬†
I slid into Alexander bala's DMS here's what I¬†¬†

01:29
said said okay I said I'm glad you're enjoying¬†
my series would you care to participate in it¬†¬†

01:35
to have your voice added and look it says seen¬†
12 hours ago Alexander banala left me on red so¬†¬†

01:44
sad very sad anyways I guess we'll just uh give¬†
him some time maybe he'll respond maybe he'll¬†¬† contribute the point of that always is I want¬†
to make sure that I am representing people the¬†¬†

01:54
correct way we've asked brijit we've asked¬†
Emanuel nobody wants to give me any answers¬†¬†

02:00
so what we're going to do this episode is just¬†
start where we left off we discussed veronique and¬†¬†

02:05
that was extremely explosive obviously for a lot¬†
of people to learn that you had this individual¬†¬†

02:12
who was obviously highly intellectual and talking¬†
about uh shopan and speaking about poetry and Paul¬†¬†

02:19
verlain and and speaking about how they needed¬†
this platform talking about a show in 1977 to¬†¬†

02:27
essentially advocate so that there were well¬†
transgendered rights and I want to specifically¬†¬†

02:35
speak about veronique in terms of what was offered¬†
something that we didn't hone in on last episode¬†¬†

02:41
it was there was a part of the correspondence¬†
which is going to become significant so when¬†¬† the interviewer asked vinique do you live¬†
alone remember vernique responded and said I'm¬†¬†

02:52
not with anyone but I've lived with a woman and¬†
conceived this Union in the style of George son¬†¬†

03:00
and chopan chopan was probably a transsexual his¬†
style of Melody the way he plays makes this quite¬†¬†

03:07
clear I think the image that has been given of¬†
the rod verlain Union is a distorted caricatured¬†¬†

03:13
image that doesn't correspond at all so this¬†
trans individual who speaks exactly like Brit¬†¬†

03:20
mccrone according to AI Tech they say this is the¬†
same person although the voice has aged over time¬†¬†

03:27
they have those same ticks in speech that is to¬†
say that is to say but we learn in that little¬†¬†

03:34
correspondence that that trans individual or¬†
identifying as a trans individual said or actually¬†¬†

03:40
said I've always viewed myself to be a woman was¬†
using this name veronique for the sake of the¬†¬†

03:46
interview and confessed to living with a woman¬†
in the style of George sand and shopan whatever¬†¬†

03:54
that means we know this person has a partner of¬†
some description a friend a partner I don't know¬†¬†

04:00
I really don't know what that means but then we¬†
learned that John Michelle trno in another strange¬†¬†

04:06
co uh coincidence shortly after this interview¬†
took place happened to marry a woman named yeah¬†¬†

04:13
you guessed it veronique of course veronique Drew¬†
we are now introducing to you and Jean Michelle¬†¬†

04:21
had their marriage take place on November 24th¬†
1980 in Blan TRV a city named Blan trvel or a town¬†¬†

04:31
named Blan TRV the union was only announced by the¬†
way after the fact okay so did not occur after the¬†¬†

04:39
fact the local newspaper Lauer peard ran a little¬†
bit about it and in that since not all of us¬†¬†

04:47
speak French it specifies that the union between¬†
these two between mour and Madame Jean trno and¬†¬†

04:55
Madame jacqu Drew um took place in the strictest¬†
privacy or we heard that before we've heard that¬†¬†

05:04
before haven't we in the strictest privacy uh I¬†
remember tone used that exact same language when¬†¬†

05:10
she described the burial of her father only we¬†
later learned that her father wasn't buried he¬†¬†

05:15
was cremated but whatever that's what Paris match¬†
said in the strictest privacy so John Michelle¬†¬†

05:21
trau getting married I don't know many people who¬†
get married and want to make sure it is in the¬†¬† strictest privacy but that's what happened between¬†
these two individuals veronique and John Michelle¬†¬†

05:31
trno and you'll never guess who was the witness¬†
to this wedding bid trno so man these siblings¬†¬†

05:38
are really close which makes it even stranger¬†
that down the line this person who's claiming¬†¬†

05:44
to have been bit trno who is living in the El¬†
Palace as the first lady just tried to cut her¬†¬†

05:52
brother Jean Michelle trogo out of her life until¬†
journalists sniffed it out that there was somebody¬†¬†

05:58
that was missing but yes um it is recorded that¬†
Brit trno was the the witness the only witness¬†¬†

06:05
that signed to this strictly confidential wedding¬†
okay then what happens next is it's recorded that¬†¬†

06:13
Jean Michelle trno and veronique Drew had a child¬†
John Jack trno that is the child that we showed¬†¬†

06:20
you that looks almost identical to Emmanuel mro¬†
it's it's really hard to convince me that these¬†¬†

06:29
two people are not related but they're not guys¬†
not according they're to the official no Legend¬†¬†

06:35
they're definitely not married that's Brit's side¬†
of the family and then two years later John Melle¬†¬†

06:41
trno and veronique Drew have a daughter Valerie¬†
then very shortly thereafter they get divorced¬†¬†

06:49
their divorce is finalized in 1987 now then¬†
things get super interesting post divorce uh uh¬†¬†

06:59
veronic Drew remarries years later 1998 a man¬†
named uh Alan deas Simone he is a major insurer¬†¬†

07:09
from Aman now something worth noting is that after¬†
her marriage to Jean Michelle veronique classes up¬†¬†

07:16
like she now has money and she begins living a¬†
life The High Life that she never lived prior to¬†¬†

07:22
okay can happen I guess you can class up in life¬†
but it's just worth noting that she's living in a¬†¬† way that she hadn't lived before so naturally the¬†
journalist uh Xavier pussard contacted her that¬†¬†

07:34
seemed like a good place to start like if you're¬†
trying to determine whether or not John Michelle¬†¬† trogo transitioned and became bit Marron you have¬†
to be willing to accept some evidence that would¬†¬†

07:44
point to the fact that you are wrong that your¬†
thesis is wrong and thus far everybody's coming¬†¬†

07:49
up dry it's just they don't want to give you any¬†
answers we're getting these manufactured pictures¬†¬† um or pictures that can only come through¬†
Best Image only come through Mimi marshan¬†¬†

08:00
which are images that should not of course be¬†
trusted because Mimi marshand has an extensive¬†¬†

08:05
criminal history she has been accused of many of¬†
forgery many of extortion and she's in a lot of¬†¬†

08:11
trouble right now so anyways Xavier brousard¬†
decided to contact veronique Drew and guess¬†¬†

08:17
what she spoke with him how strange somebody in¬†
the family in the unit speaking to a journalist¬†¬†

08:24
and she wanted to speak with him you know when¬†
he contacted her on WhatsApp he she said um¬†¬†

08:29
yeah let's set up a time to speak in the future¬†
and essentially what she did was she wanted to¬†¬†

08:35
dismiss these rumors about her ex-husband of many¬†
many moons ago John Michelle trau and so I'm going¬†¬†

08:41
to read this portion directly from Xavier¬†
P's book which is available on Amazon called¬†¬†

08:47
becoming Brit and I want you to remember Xavier¬†
pussard is meticulous he has kept recordings¬†¬†

08:53
of every single person that he spoke to along¬†
this 8-year investigation so from his book he¬†¬†

08:59
writes this in first person so I was looking to¬†
contact veronique Drew what was the materiality¬†¬†

09:05
of her marriage to Jean Michelle trogo who was¬†
he how and when had they parted after marrying¬†¬†

09:12
a trogo veronique Drew continued her upward social¬†
Mobility by marrying a la Simone now listed in the¬†¬†

09:20
batin mundan that is where I found her number I¬†
contacted on WhatsApp she agreed to get back to¬†¬†

09:27
me the next day and did so our conversation¬†
lasted half an hour even though she repeats¬†¬†

09:33
the wording often heard from the trogo Entourage¬†
example those women are crazy referring to Natasha¬†¬†

09:39
Ray and amandine Roy she first pretends not to¬†
know what the call is about about Jean Michelle¬†¬†

09:46
becoming brijit right listen sir I don't know it's¬†
ridiculous anyway because I have two children with¬†¬†

09:53
Jean Michelle I saw on YouTube that they made a¬†
family tree where they even put that I might be¬†¬†

09:59
macron's mother veronique Drew is of course¬†
referring to questions raised by internet¬†¬†

10:04
users about The Uncanny physical resemblance¬†
between Emanuel macron the husband of bjit¬†¬†

10:10
and Jean jaac trau the son of Jean Michelle¬†
trau she goes on says listen sir I have been¬†¬†

10:17
divorced from Jean Michelle trno for many years¬†
listen sir I have remarried and my children are¬†¬†

10:22
here I don't want any problems but I can tell you¬†
that Johan Michelle is not bit that's ridiculous¬†¬†

10:30
I had uh two chocolate stores in bouet well I¬†
had I had two children it didn't work out so I¬†¬†

10:36
went back to live with my mom and that's all but I¬†
can tell you that John Michelle is not bit Xavier¬†¬†

10:45
says I take her at her word and I ask her for¬†
photos of her shared past with John Michelle trau¬†¬†

10:52
promising that if they are conclusive to close¬†
the case without even publishing those photos¬†¬†

11:01
ver Veron Drew says to him bit told me not to¬†
get involved I don't want any trouble about my¬†¬†

11:07
children or about um it's not relevant to the¬†
family anymore okay so a couple of things that¬†¬†

11:14
I want you to remember just to point out right¬†
there about that little correspondent she tells¬†¬† Xavier that the divorce between her that after¬†
the divorce between her and John Michelle TR¬†¬†

11:23
no she went to live with her mother okay she¬†
also stresses emphatically that bit is not¬†¬†

11:29
Michelle trau but also that Brit told her not to¬†
get involved that's quite strange just off the bat¬†¬†

11:35
that's strange because you have ch two children¬†
with her brother and you mean to tell me that it¬†¬†

11:40
wasn't just your ex-husband John Michelle trau¬†
the person that you raised your children with¬†¬†

11:45
uh who said anything to you but rather his former¬†
his sister his your former sister-in-law who told¬†¬†

11:52
you not to get involved okay that seems a little¬†
strange I would I would expect her to say Jean¬†¬†

11:57
Michelle chno told me not to get involved with¬†
this you guys are all crazy go away but okay¬†¬† let's park by the side you want to live with¬†
your mom post divorce and for whatever reason¬†¬†

12:06
for whatever reason you're listening to what bjit¬†
mcon is telling you to do rather than your should¬†¬† be ex-husband who you've not mentioned in this¬†
conversation and who she does not mention in the¬†¬†

12:15
capacity of her having a uh present relationship¬†
with a current relationship with okay so jumping¬†¬†

12:21
back into Xavier's conversation back into first¬†
person he says this in his book as I Xavier argue¬†¬†

12:28
that she should hold Bri mccon to account because¬†
it's because of her silence that her own photo as¬†¬†

12:34
well as the photo of her children John Jack in¬†
particular are circulating on social networks¬†¬†

12:40
she cuts me off and inexp inexplicably blurts out¬†
and also I know macron's father well I don't know¬†¬†

12:48
him very well but he was a surgeon at the Aman¬†
hospital but I didn't know Emanuel macron we¬†¬†

12:55
lived in tulah and I didn't even know him I saw¬†
him at my daughter's wedding the first time I had¬†¬† ever seen him then I can hear another person on¬†
the Line veronique Drew stops visibly embarrassed¬†¬†

13:06
as if she's gone too far she pulls herself¬†
together and asks me well and what is your name¬†¬†

13:13
end of conversation so we are to Garner from this¬†
conversation that someone was in the room okay she¬†¬†

13:19
said I will agree to speak with you and then there¬†
was someone in the room when she was having this¬†¬† conversation with Xavier pussard that stopped her¬†
when she gave a random but very interesting tid¬†¬†

13:29
that she knew Emanuel macron's Father John¬†
Michelle macron but she did not know anything¬†¬†

13:36
of Emanuel mrrone until he appeared at her¬†
daughter Valerie's wedding and needless to¬†¬†

13:43
say she never did provide Xavier pussard with any¬†
photos of her ex-husband or their strictly private¬†¬†

13:50
wedding anything that could have immediately¬†
just dispelled these rumors uh these Missing¬†¬† Years so to speak of his life and bit trag¬†
no's life that would have just put everything¬†¬†

13:59
to bed they're never willing to do that right so¬†
afterwards Xavier pusar does what he does best¬†¬†

14:06
he's investigated what she had told him okay was¬†
veronique the George S to brigit macron's chopan¬†¬†

14:14
were they perhaps living together and did she¬†
maybe help Brit Brit macron eventually create¬†¬†

14:22
an alibi for her past or was she telling the¬†
truth was everybody crazy and John Michelle¬†¬†

14:27
trno was just her ex-husband and he's very well¬†
and alive he just can't speak to anybody right¬†¬†

14:32
now well I can tell you that Xavier was able to¬†
determine that there was a very weird pattern¬†¬† of behavior for veronique following her divorce¬†
from Jean Michelle trau namely that she refused to¬†¬†

14:43
acknowledge her previous marriage to John Michelle¬†
trau even when it was required of her by laws okay¬†¬†

14:52
for example in a tax document here it is that is¬†
dated in January of 1992 she listed that she had¬†¬†

15:01
only previously been married once to a man named¬†
Serge Fran franch cha and by the way that's true¬†¬†

15:08
she had first married Serge and then she married¬†
Jean Michelle trogo but of course she had two¬†¬†

15:14
marriages and she leaves off jean Michelle trau¬†
she says I've only been married once that is a¬†¬†

15:19
lie who Among Us would lie on a tax document it's¬†
a very uh uh scary territory right you don't want¬†¬†

15:28
to be caught lying on tax documents and yet she¬†
did this she removed one of her marriages then she¬†¬†

15:34
did it again in a public real estate Collective¬†
uh that she put together to purchase her house in¬†¬†

15:40
Corsica I think it would be similar to putting¬†
your house in an LLC in 2018 she reported that¬†¬†

15:46
she had actually never previously been married¬†
in a document that was issued by a notary okay¬†¬†

15:52
she lied in the presence of a notary and again¬†
removed her marriage from Jean Michelle trau who¬†¬†

15:59
was instructing her to essentially pretend that¬†
she had never been married to Jean Mel Chau UND¬†¬†

16:05
document she just removed him for the rest of her¬†
life it seems everything that Xavier could find¬†¬†

16:11
he was also able to determine through documents¬†
that she had lied to him over the phone when she¬†¬†

16:17
said that following the divorce she went to live¬†
with her mother he was able to find records that¬†¬†

16:22
revealed to him that actually she went to live¬†
in an apartment in Aman's that was owned by Jean¬†¬†

16:29
Michelle trna's father so the trno family put her¬†
up in an apartment and I don't know I guess it's¬†¬†

16:36
not totally strange that your father-in-law¬†
might do that but what is strange is that you¬†¬† would lie about that years later when people¬†
start asking questions about your ex-husband¬†¬†

16:47
okay very strange it's worth noting also that¬†
right around this time of their divorce okay¬†¬†

16:53
so they're officially divorced in 1987 you can¬†
assume they separated sometime before that because¬†¬†

16:59
to finally get your divorce stamped and done and¬†
sealed it usually takes a little longer maybe one¬†¬†

17:05
year if you're going really quickly um but that's¬†
the time that Brit mcon the Brit mcon that we know¬†¬†

17:12
okay the public record bit mccon that's when she¬†
be begins her very public and traceable career¬†¬†

17:20
as a teacher okay she goes and enters in 1986 at¬†
the Lucy Berger School suddenly changes the career¬†¬†

17:28
total career change and then this is all they want¬†
to show us oh look she was a teacher here and a¬†¬†

17:34
teacher here and a teacher there and of course the¬†
uh the Future Love of her life Emanuel was just 9¬†¬†

17:41
years old so it was just five more years five more¬†
years and then Brit mccon the one that we know uh¬†¬†

17:49
will meet the love of his life oh did I say his¬†
love of her life this is a good time to tell you¬†¬†

17:59
that most of what you think you even know about¬†
Emmanuel macron thus far his legacy yeah it's just¬†¬†

18:07
objectively not true Emanuel had a major handup¬†
in life this guy so private we don't know much¬†¬†

18:15
about him what we do know about him is I would say¬†
quite Sinister it's quite Sinister it's making me¬†¬†

18:23
think I don't know of that movie The Manchurian¬†
Candidate I'll tell you guys about that after¬†¬†

18:28
after a brief break from our sponsors I just want¬†
to thank preborn they've been our sponsors from¬†¬†

18:33
the beginning of this podcast uh we know they¬†
are doing such great work Planned Parenthood¬†¬† is spending Millions to Target vulnerable women¬†
who are being convinced uh that they should take¬†¬†

18:43
the abortion pill because it's a quick and easy¬†
solution but what Planned Parenthood doesn't tell¬†¬† these ladies is that there is a Devastation that¬†
follows there's pain there's regret there's the¬†¬†

18:52
reality of having ended A Life That's why pre-born¬†
is stepping in through Innovative technology¬†¬†

18:57
pre-born is reaching a determined women before¬†
they take that pill before it's too late in fact¬†¬†

19:02
to date pre-born network of clinics has rescued¬†
over 300,000 babies and have seen over 90,000¬†¬†

19:09
women come to Christ but it does not stop there¬†
pre-born network of clinics are with these moms¬†¬†

19:14
every step of the way offering them counseling¬†
maternity supplies and the support that they need¬†¬† to choose life but they cannot do it without us¬†
which is why uh just $28 will help to provide an¬†¬†

19:24
ultrasound to a woman that is in crisis that is¬†
literally it $28 to help her to see her baby and¬†¬†

19:30
choose life instead so if you'd like to donate you¬†
just dial pound 250 and say the keyword baby again¬†¬†

19:36
that's pound 250 baby or you can donate securely¬†
at pre-born dcom Candace that's pre-born dcom¬†¬†

19:43
Candace also reminding you about gold Co president¬†
Trump is back and that could be obviously great¬†¬†

19:49
for gold and silver because under Trump's first¬†
term the price of gold soared 53% and the price¬†¬†

19:54
of silver jumped 51% will gold continue to break¬†
records and 2025 and Beyond gold and silver have¬†¬†

20:01
been used as a store of value for centuries as¬†
you very well know the government cannot easily¬†¬† manipulate them and they are known as Hedges¬†
against Market risk and inflation and that's¬†¬†

20:10
why I personally bought gold and silver from my¬†
great Partners at Gold Co goldco is a toppr rated¬†¬†

20:15
precious metals company they have supported¬†
the show from the beginning like I said and¬†¬† they have helped hardworking Americans purchase¬†
over $3 billion in gold and silver they know what¬†¬†

20:24
they're doing so right now you can get a free¬†
copy of their 2025 gold and silver k on top of¬†¬†

20:29
that you could also qualify for up to $115,000 in¬†
bonus silver possibly even more so to learn more¬†¬†

20:34
head over to Candace likes gold.com again that's¬†
Candace likes gold.com all right so regarding¬†¬†

20:42
Emanuel macron we may have accidentally told you¬†
some lies I don't know we've been telling you¬†¬† what the media has said about him and the media¬†
has definitely been spinning some tales about¬†¬†

20:51
him painting him as as this mosart virtuoso just¬†
ahead of his time trying to uh I don't know make¬†¬†

20:57
everybody aqu yes to this story that is at best¬†
a story of stat statutory rape and could still be¬†¬†

21:05
prosecuted by the way until the end of this year¬†
which would be fascinating but yeah the Press told¬†¬†

21:11
everybody he was just just this amazingly gifted¬†
writer who also loved to play sh chopan for fit on¬†¬†

21:18
the piano okay cool um from Xavier's book in 2020¬†
the myth of the writer macron was definitively¬†¬†

21:27
debunked by a journal like they kept saying that¬†
he would write these novels and Brit would talk¬†¬† about his passion for writing and interviews well¬†
essentially they realized that uh nope that isn't¬†¬†

21:39
true none of that is true and it they created¬†
this idea of him really just because they wanted¬†¬†

21:46
the public to believe that he was this genius and¬†
that he therefore deserved uh to be suddenly in¬†¬†

21:53
the midst as a politician that he had had this¬†
background where he was kind of a boy genius¬†¬†

21:58
and like I said that could not be further from¬†
the truth the reality is Emanuel macron's real¬†¬†

22:05
story is more of a fake it till you make it¬†
okay if that's how how you would say it fake¬†¬†

22:10
it till you make it as we have stressed before¬†
not much has known about his childhood okay it's¬†¬†

22:15
weird just gets very strange his mother we now¬†
know was in charge of the gender reassignment¬†¬†

22:21
program at the Social Security office his¬†
father was a psychiatrist but according to¬†¬†

22:28
veronique she had no memory of Emanuel having¬†
been around him his grandmother manette we know¬†¬†

22:35
definitely was involved in his childhood it's¬†
the only one he speaks about affectionately or¬†¬† or even relates to his childhood in his book we¬†
also know that Grandma had a knack for pedophile¬†¬†

22:44
Centric books it was Grandma's thing what are¬†
you going do she likes these like pedophile¬†¬† Centric books she's just like hey is that a¬†
past yeah that's a really cool thing let's¬†¬†

22:53
talk about Andre GED let's talk about it let's¬†
talk about all of these weird passages me and my¬†¬†

22:58
grandchild we share this with one another like¬†
I said we learned that he was a bit of a loner¬†¬†

23:04
he didn't have many friends the friends people¬†
that went to school with him didn't even know¬†¬† what his parents did well according to the¬†
Wall Street journal's book The calculated¬†¬†

23:14
rise of macron it was the Roth's child family the¬†
Roth's child bank that had everything to do with¬†¬†

23:22
his professional resume and interestingly¬†
uh enough Xavier pussard had discovered¬†¬†

23:29
that the bank made an internal error in¬†
their documents when they listed macron¬†¬†

23:35
who is supposed to be born in Aman as having¬†
instead been born in Paris and they made this¬†¬†

23:43
error on multiple documents by the way I'm going¬†
to show you a few of them uh and the reality is¬†¬†

23:49
of course this keeps coming up that we are told¬†
in the official biography that he's born in Aman¬†¬†

23:54
then we have the former mayor of Aman who said no¬†
he's uh what was it Tua like from L tuet area now¬†¬†

24:04
we have the Rothchilds reporting that he's born¬†
in Paris and we just don't know what's real and¬†¬†

24:09
what's false okay we really don't know but we do¬†
have this uh from the uh rotha Bank minutes here¬†¬†

24:17
it says he is born n 21 December 1977 a and they¬†
do this again and they just keep making this ut¬†¬†

24:26
oh mistake that he's born in Paris but but it must¬†
have been a clerical error now Emanuel himself has¬†¬†

24:32
never denied his closeness with the Rothchilds in¬†
fact he said this in 2012 and I quote I had a very¬†¬†

24:42
unintelligible background no one could understand¬†
me outside of Roth's child okay and when he became¬†¬†

24:50
the economic advisor to the Socialist president¬†
franois haland he said that David daro's child¬†¬†

25:08
you're going to be his protector when you get into¬†
Power I'm going to tell you read you this passage¬†¬†

25:13
uh regarding him climbing the ladder at the¬†
rothshild bank because it apparently his rise made¬†¬†

25:21
no sense to his colleagues this is from Xavier's¬†
Book quote within the bank Emanuel macron's¬†¬†

25:28
progress surprised many Sarah Haro explained that¬†
he quote had been identified as a very singular¬†¬†

25:36
personality with a lot of contacts and Sophie¬†
Javari who trained him at Rothchild and Co reports¬†¬†

25:44
that he quote had very highlevel contacts for our¬†
files with links to the state end quote according¬†¬†

25:52
to her her most experienced colleagues were¬†
surprised by his quote supports at the top level¬†¬†

25:59
of the bank notably David der rooth's child and¬†
his right-hand man Francois henro who occasionally¬†¬†

26:07
allowed him to quote bypass his immediate¬†
hierarchy this support enabled him to become¬†¬†

26:14
at the age of 32 the youngest managing partner in¬†
the bank's history even though according to other¬†¬†

26:22
employees he was a poor technician quote macron¬†
doesn't know much about it quote in meetings we¬†¬†

26:30
Giggle and think ardently here's another mrrone¬†
gem now reporting on other confidences from¬†¬†

26:38
Rothchild and co- Executives journalist Mark endal¬†
confirms the bitterness aroused by his accelerated¬†¬†

26:45
promotion quote at Rothchild he has the reputation¬†
of never having written an equation he didn't¬†¬†

26:54
even know what iida is the operating profit of a¬†
company David dchild had to quote violate them to¬†¬†

27:04
appoint him to managing partner okay the idea of¬†
a managing partner of rtha Bank not knowing what¬†¬†

27:13
iida stands for like that I mean it's I mean I'm I¬†
I'm not a financial institution over here earnings¬†¬†

27:20
before interest in tax he didn't know what that¬†
was and so people around Rothchild who watched his¬†¬†

27:28
rise and were bitter about it and knew that David¬†
D rild had a hand in this again you can read about¬†¬†

27:33
this in the Wall Street journals book you can read¬†
about this in Mark endals book The ambiguous past¬†¬†

27:39
of macron people don't understand how he was just¬†
sort of elevated at this bank and by the way that¬†¬†

27:46
elevation actually took place before he even got¬†
to the rosch's bank it also took place in school¬†¬†

27:54
so we were told he was Mozart right we were told¬†
that this kid just had it he just was so brilliant¬†¬†

28:01
then you're going to find this other point to be¬†
quite odd in 2002 when he was 25 years old Emanuel¬†¬†

28:07
macron was admitted into Ena that's that's a¬†
school it's basically the national school of¬†¬†

28:13
administration a Hyper Elite French graduate¬†
program this the best way for me to explain it¬†¬†

28:18
to English listeners okay okay yet he failed entry¬†
into this school twice and then he was magically¬†¬†

28:27
admitted without having to answer the question¬†
that was asked during the oral exam that's a¬†¬†

28:33
component of getting into this school this Elite¬†
School essentially you have to attend to get like¬†¬†

28:39
a highlevel job as a financial executive they¬†
just allowed him to be admitted without doing¬†¬†

28:45
the oral exam like like that's ever been done¬†
before okay then somehow he ends up at in the¬†¬†

28:51
top rankings of his class and is able to join the¬†
inspector generals of finances and his Co students¬†¬†

29:01
around him his Co colleagues around him knew¬†
clearly knew that he was an idiot and that that¬†¬†

29:07
meant that the rankings were cooked so there was¬†
public bash backlash amongst the other students¬†¬†

29:12
within his year they literally mobilized against¬†
their fraudulent results which then led to the¬†¬†

29:18
Council of the state having having to intervene¬†
and cancel the school rankings for that year for¬†¬†

29:25
the first time in the school's history okay for¬†
the first time in the school's history could you¬†¬† imagine this like an NBA program you're like this¬†
kid's an idiot I don't even know he got here and¬†¬†

29:34
then they released the wanking like actually he¬†
the smartest kid in the class and then they all¬†¬† went okay what is going on here clearly this is¬†
cooked this is completely cooked and they get¬†¬†

29:44
they get the council involved the state Council¬†
involved and they go you know what how about just¬†¬† no results this year like what what a quick little¬†
point on that by the way is that in 2021 when he¬†¬†

29:55
man mome was President he decided to essentially¬†
cancel the ENA he's like oh we actually need more¬†¬†

30:01
diversity in banking so we shouldn't even have¬†
this this this program this is this is ridiculous¬†¬†

30:07
this is crazy we just need to have more diversity¬†
yeah okay buddy I'm sure that's what it is sounds¬†¬†

30:13
like maybe your entire career you were just being¬†
prepared for this moment this moment of becoming¬†¬†

30:20
the president of France and you actually what you¬†
are is the only thing we can verify which is a¬†¬† drama student you know how to act you know how to¬†
act and pretend that you are the president while¬†¬†

30:30
there is clearly somebody behind you that has been¬†
moving you all through life another odd point was¬†¬†

30:36
that when he was admitted into the Roth's child¬†
Bank in 2008 he was supposed to have publicized¬†¬†

30:42
an order from the minister which granted him leave¬†
from compulsory civil service for whatever reason¬†¬†

30:49
he was exempt from that compulsory procedure so¬†
he didn't even have to reinstate his Civil Service¬†¬†

30:55
when he then left the bank and was magically¬†
appointed right to president Holland's team as¬†¬†

31:01
an economic adviser like what in fact the deputy¬†
chairman of the council for state legal ethics¬†¬†

31:07
spoke out about this he remarked that he had never¬†
seen anything like it he had never seen someone¬†¬†

31:14
given an exemption on this not having to go by¬†
certain steps I'm sure just like the students at¬†¬†

31:20
the ENA had never seen someone who couldn't even¬†
get into the school who clearly was not at the¬†¬†

31:26
top of the class magically be awarded and being¬†
told like actually that's the brightest kid in¬†¬†

31:31
the class actually here we go they were outraged¬†
and they should have been outraged and the people¬†¬†

31:37
that work with at Rothchild Banks were similarly¬†
outraged this guy doesn't even know what iida is¬†¬† it sounds like actually he's an idiot he's an¬†
idiot when it comes to finances and he probably¬†¬†

31:47
could not wax poetic about anything and he is¬†
just performative it makes me think of the story¬†¬†

31:53
of that politician when he's talking about uh uh¬†
Pyrenees peran oh my grandmother is she you know¬†¬†

32:01
all that my great-grandparents wanted was for her¬†
to learn French you know and cuz she only spoke¬†¬†

32:08
penan and he's like that's not a language not a¬†
language that's why I say this reminds me of the¬†¬†

32:16
murrian candidate now regarding the Rothschild's¬†
family there is so much that I could say here but¬†¬†

32:24
I do not want this episode to get hit on YouTube¬†
suffice it to say you could look up any of them¬†¬†

32:30
uh The Proven ties to Jeffrey Epstein the various¬†
pedophilic and incest scandals which are abound¬†¬†

32:39
and have surrounded this family um you could¬†
look up anything but know that any journalist¬†¬†

32:46
who begins to write about this in France has¬†
to face anti-em catism charges right you can't¬†¬†

32:52
oh gosh God forbid you actually report on facts¬†
pertaining to the Rothschild's family and their¬†¬†

32:58
empire what we'll do instead here is leave you¬†
with what Xavier pussard said because I think¬†¬†

33:05
he summed it up quite brilliantly regarding the¬†
Rothchilds he wrote notoriously the roths child's¬†¬†

33:12
longevity and preservation of their Fortune are¬†
based on an extensive practice of endogamy and¬†¬†

33:20
alliances between cousins essentially inter¬†
breeding at a conference at the museum of art¬†¬†

33:28
history Natalie Reams David deroth child's¬†
cousin went further declaring quote a very¬†¬†

33:35
common practice in such families Vice is nice but¬†
incest is best because it stays in the family we¬†¬†

33:43
are simply raised to be silent so that nothing¬†
comes out we are brought up with this weight to¬†¬†

33:50
make sure and it works that we never speak out¬†
Xavier concludes by saying words that Echo what we¬†¬†

33:57
encountered throughout our investigation of Brit¬†
a family cloistered in silence jealous to protect¬†¬†

34:04
a family secret zealous to protect a family¬†
secret that has become a state Affair and I am¬†¬†

34:11
telling you on that closing chapter regarding the¬†
Rothchilds and the scandals abound uh including¬†¬†

34:18
scandals that pertain to David D Roth's child you¬†
will want to P pick up Xavier Bard's book becoming¬†¬†

34:24
prit because what I have given you thus far is¬†
truly the tip of the iceberg I cannot explain to¬†¬†

34:30
you how many uh pedophile scandals I have removed¬†
from this podcasting again because I'm going this¬†¬†

34:38
is on YouTube so I have to make this as rated¬†
G as I possibly can it cannot continually be¬†¬†

34:47
the case that these are all just coin inces okay¬†
there's just way too many coincidences adding up¬†¬†

34:54
you can't play the all my homies are pedophiles¬†
and trans except for me card I don't know I just¬†¬†

35:00
would feel a little bit weird about that right¬†
if you just had an individual in your life you're¬†¬† like I swear everyone around me is involved in¬†
this but it's not me right that's kind of what¬†¬†

35:11
Emanuel mrrone is trying to sell to us right now¬†
everyone's involved and all this stuff but not me¬†¬†

35:16
I now look at him having come out of that book¬†
and I think he's an idiot he's just a puet and¬†¬† he has been groomed from the time that he was a¬†
child but groomed by who who is his father who is¬†¬†

35:28
his father if if people if he doesn't have this¬†
relationship with Shan Michelle and we found out¬†¬† all throughout this affair that he doesn't really¬†
seem to have close relations with his parents or¬†¬†

35:40
these his doctors perhaps I don't know you can ask¬†
pointed questions to them but they don't want to¬†¬†

35:45
answer any of these questions because they know¬†
that we have figured out the game and the game is¬†¬† is that you have to be very precise in how you ask¬†
them questions because they can change identities¬†¬†

35:57
and they can change names the family has this¬†
capacity so if you are wondering the answer to¬†¬†

36:03
why it is that Xavier pussard has never been sued¬†
by the macron family uh what is it exactly that¬†¬†

36:10
saved Xavier pussard whereas the women Natasha Ray¬†
and almandine Roy who did wonderful work ended up¬†¬†

36:16
getting sued for little mistakes the answer is¬†
actually kind of funny because it kind of boils¬†¬† down to the differences between men and women so¬†
I would say that men women first and foremost tend¬†¬†

36:27
to be more intuitive we are more intuitive we¬†
go with our guts I say this all the time to my¬†¬† husband this person just gives me a bad Vibe¬†
I don't trust this person I tend to go with my¬†¬†

36:37
gut a lot more I do believe that we we have God's¬†
intuition especially when it comes to our children¬†¬†

36:43
but men tend to be a bit more technical right¬†
where they will just need to mathematically Ute¬†¬†

36:50
something to be sure about something and they'll¬†
question things and maybe not go with their gut¬†¬† all the time or go with their gut at all and¬†
so that is really what happened with Natasha¬†¬†

37:00
Ray and Xavier pussard so Xavier pussard used a¬†
technology I mentioned it to you on last uh last¬†¬†

37:07
week's episode or a couple days ago on the episode¬†
but I want to to demonstrate that technology for¬†¬† you because when he said it to me my my my girl¬†
brain just sort of went okay I'm not into AI¬†¬†

37:17
I'm not into Tech but then when he explained to¬†
me that that this this technology known as face¬†¬† Plus+ is basically the world economic forums has¬†
has listed it amongst its 11 smartest companies¬†¬†

37:30
okay uh it is headquartered in Beijing China as¬†
I mentioned to you it is what China uses as their¬†¬†

37:36
software for facial recognition and when he showed¬†
me how accurate it is I was positively shocked I¬†¬†

37:43
genuinely shocked amazed and then terrified about¬†
the direction of the world when you think about¬†¬†

37:48
these globalists who I believe want to turn us¬†
into like sort of these technological slaves and¬†¬† recognizing that this artificial intelligence is¬†
bang on accurate and so yes this it's valued at¬†¬†

38:01
$1 billion from the WF website it tells us that¬†
it was founded in 2011 um and it is a leader in¬†¬†

38:09
Machinery visual artificial intelligence industry¬†
and face recognition systems so I want to show you¬†¬†

38:15
like just as he was showing me this technology¬†
and I was kind of testing it to see if it could¬†¬†

38:21
get something wrong just how accurate it could be¬†
because we now live in an age of plastic surgery¬†¬†

38:26
right women can literally change their faces and¬†
the fact that this technology is still able to¬†¬†

38:33
process who that person is is amazing to me so¬†
here's an example and this is also featured in¬†¬† his book but um I want to point out Kim Bassinger¬†
there on the right who has modified her face a¬†¬†

38:45
lot okay it still knows it is looking and it is¬†
saying yeah no that's still can Bassinger and it¬†¬†

38:52
comes back with a percentage and it's telling¬†
you essentially you get into the 75% range you¬†¬† get above 70% and and it is very high like yes¬†
we are certain that that is her and it is her¬†¬†

39:04
it is accurately her um I'm also going to show you¬†
that it is able even to take a childhood photo and¬†¬†

39:11
even though that might make it lower or decrease¬†
and you may not get into the 70 range you may get¬†¬†

39:17
into the high 60 range it is still able to tell¬†
you that yes this is the correct person so you're¬†¬†

39:23
seeing here uh Shirley Temple on the bottom there¬†
Hillary Clinton I mean her her face really hasn't¬†¬†

39:28
changed much from the time that she was a child¬†
with 78% confidence um on the top there of course¬†¬†

39:34
you've got Princess Diana uh you've got the queen¬†
it's able to come back and to say to you despite¬†¬†

39:41
all of this time and age that this is the same¬†
person which is incredible like I said then here¬†¬†

39:49
this is the Reason by the way which to me I¬†
would have been if I had to to place a bet on¬†¬†

39:55
a horse I would have bet on Natasha Ray and¬†
her instincts when she first saw that photo¬†¬†

40:02
of Andre Lis Andre Lewis at his wedding and¬†
then she found out that he had a cousin who¬†¬†

40:08
was named John Lise okay so just looking at¬†
this photo on the left there is the wedding¬†¬†

40:14
photo obviously the groom on the right there¬†
is his cousin that's John Louise so these are¬†¬†

40:20
I would have thought the same person so she looked¬†
at this photo and she's like uh no I actually¬†¬† think that the person in the photo is this guy¬†
and I think that they're playing us and that if¬†¬†

40:30
I had just looked at these photos and trusted¬†
my own eyes I would have totally co-signed to¬†¬†

40:36
what Natasha Ray said that looks to be the exact¬†
same person but Xavier pussard so Natasha said¬†¬†

40:43
that or wrote that and she got sued for defamation¬†
Xavier pussard instead ran these two photos in his¬†¬†

40:49
technology and it told him no it said it's not the¬†
same person in face Plus+ it came back 52% low so¬†¬†

40:59
he said okay I must be missing something this¬†
I'm going to rely on technology it's telling me¬†¬† that these are two different people and they look¬†
so much these first cousins look a lot alike but¬†¬†

41:07
the technology picked it up and of course we then¬†
learned as we covered yesterday or two days ago¬†¬†

41:13
rather that it it actually was a different person¬†
that that John Luiz oier was a a first cousin¬†¬†

41:19
he was not in fact the same person that was¬†
pictured there which is the reason that she¬†¬† got sued for defamation again not attacking the¬†
substance of her claims not attacking whether¬†¬†

41:28
or not Brit had transitioned from Jean Michelle¬†
trau rather attacking an error that is going to¬†¬†

41:33
happen as you're investigating a story and when¬†
people are refusing to give you any answers and¬†¬† in many times intentionally sending you down¬†
the wrong path right so regarding brijit mcon¬†¬†

41:46
who has now changed her face as we learned¬†
we know that she's seeing this doctor she's¬†¬†

41:52
getting feminization surgery this is a good way¬†
and plus she's now in her 80s right and we've got¬†¬†

42:00
only pictures from her childhood uh only pictures¬†
of Jean Michelle trno from his childhood when you¬†¬†

42:07
compare this with the tech the tech returns this¬†
way it tells us that this is a high probability¬†¬†

42:15
and this is with dentur teeth different teeth¬†
right it is is telling us that this is this is¬†¬†

42:22
this boy in this school photo okay this is this¬†
boy in this school photo it is returning from¬†¬†

42:29
normal to high highest being there at 17.3% and¬†
that's just with the school photo and with years¬†¬†

42:39
of work okay we're not even comparing this to the¬†
school photos when she still had the teeth that¬†¬† you see there on the left hand side right when¬†
bit still had teeth this is with a ton of work¬†¬†

42:50
being done by the magician to the transgendered¬†
Community right the guy that can make you a woman¬†¬†

42:56
he looks at you looks at women like their clay¬†
and it is still certain that that is brigit mcon¬†¬†

43:03
okay that that little boy became Brit macron it¬†
is also certain that the woman in the wedding¬†¬†

43:10
photo so more aged on Brit trno who married Andre¬†
Lewis is not the first lady brijit macron that we¬†¬†

43:19
today it is returning low probability that these¬†
are the same people what's going on here what do¬†¬†

43:26
you mean it's returning low probability this¬†
maybe gives us the answer to why she will not¬†¬†

43:31
answer she will not join a lawsuit and assert¬†
formally by just saying that is me in the photo¬†¬†

43:38
okay she will not answer my questions as we've¬†
had our legal team go out and we have said we¬†¬† don't want to lie just like Xavier we're not here¬†
in the business to spread lies okay doesn't help¬†¬†

43:47
me doesn't make my audience want to come back to¬†
my show when I get busted intentionally lying and¬†¬† defaming someone for the sheer sport of it help me¬†
help you Brit is this you in the wedding photo she¬†¬†

43:58
doesn't want to answer that question okay well if¬†
we turn to AI technology the reason why she's not¬†¬† answering that question is because it's not her in¬†
the photo okay that is somebody else that somebody¬†¬†

44:08
else went by the name brijit trogo that's very¬†
interesting John Michelle trogo at that wedding¬†¬†

44:14
we're not allowed to see any photos of him at¬†
that wedding because apparently all photos have¬†¬† been destroyed other than two lingering photos of¬†
the uh of Andre Lise Andre Lewis and same for bit¬†¬†

44:28
trau we are just finding that despite all photos¬†
that should be made available we can't even get¬†¬†

44:33
our hands on school photos School photos we just¬†
they don't want to give them they don't want to¬†¬†

44:40
give them up the nothing exists it's just all been¬†
deleted a whole person just got deleted okay and¬†¬†

44:47
regarding the communion photo which we instantly¬†
looked at and said it looks nothing like the first¬†¬†

44:52
lady I'm looking at my eyes it returns this answer¬†
the text says no again low nope not happening¬†¬†

45:02
sorry ain't her okay so what do we discern from¬†
that what we discern from that is that the photos¬†¬†

45:11
that Mimi Mar best image agency Mimi marshan¬†
who's up with the gangsters doing work making¬†¬†

45:19
sure that pedophile scandals don't hit the Press¬†
disgusting pedophile scandals she's stopping that¬†¬†

45:26
from hitting the Press she's she's the popess of¬†
the celebrity media doesn't print without her say¬†¬†

45:32
so the person that documentary filmmakers have¬†
to go through to get any images of the first lady¬†¬†

45:38
and then when they get these images there are a¬†
few and far between what three entered into the¬†¬†

45:43
public Arena of her childhood and all of those¬†
photos one or two from her childhood rather and¬†¬†

45:51
one from her uh marriage alleged marriage well¬†
Chinese tech software sanctioned by the wef as¬†¬†

46:01
the best in the game is telling us that that is¬†
not the current first lady of France what are we¬†¬†

46:09
to make of that what are we to make of that the¬†
silence the punking the intimidation techniques¬†¬†

46:17
going after people for taxes is sending the¬†
figurative or the French IRS to go after people¬†¬†

46:23
when they can't get him on defamation uh going¬†
after trying to figure out who's funding people¬†¬†

46:29
us having had as we did in the past our interview¬†
with Xavier pussard taken down from YouTube for¬†¬†

46:35
weird reasons demanding censorship accusing Xavier¬†
pussard of anti-Semitism for an article that he¬†¬†

46:41
wrote had nothing to do nothing to do by the way¬†
with anything pertaining to brijit mcon but he¬†¬†

46:47
said article he wrote 5 years ago about the power¬†
who controls all the media in France they're get¬†¬†

46:54
they're coming after him for anti-Semitism he¬†
didn't even say these people are Jewish he just¬†¬† wrote the names of the people who have power in¬†
the media in France they're looking for anything¬†¬†

47:05
as opposed to just what showing us photos of your¬†
life married to Andre Lewis are you going to tell¬†¬†

47:11
us that that has similarly also been destroyed¬†
or are we to make of this that the person¬†¬†

47:19
that is living in the El Palace the person who¬†
definitively groomed the president who actually¬†¬†

47:27
has not been so honest about his background¬†
who is not the genius virtuoso that has been¬†¬† presented to the public Brit mccrone perhaps¬†
is Jean Michelle trno Jean Michelle trog no¬†¬†

47:43
who during a transition the picture that I'm¬†
seeing right now and I'm happy to correct it¬†¬† again because I know you guys are watching at¬†
the L Palace please just answer our 21 questions¬†¬†

47:53
because the picture that I'm getting from all of¬†
this and again we have not even gotten to Xavier¬†¬† P's explosive interview is that something¬†
happened in the 80s something happened in¬†¬†

48:03
the mid-70s and the 80s veronique veronique¬†
Drew Jean Michelle trau your reappearance in¬†¬†

48:09
1986 as a teacher the lies that you have told¬†
sexy Claudia shiffer she didn't exist then I¬†¬†

48:16
don't see a woman with legs irresistible that the¬†
young boys just couldn't wait oh my God look at¬†¬†

48:24
that what are you talking about who sanctioned¬†
these lies in the Press who are you really and¬†¬†

48:32
what is your relationship to Emanuel macron what¬†
is Emanuel marron's relationship to you what is¬†¬†

48:37
the relationship between Emanuel Marron and Jean¬†
Jack it's not feeling like a nephew to me I don't¬†¬†

48:43
know something feels off there when I look at¬†
that picture something feels very wrong there¬†¬†

48:49
of course it's so simple to answer these questions¬†
and yet you refuse to you go so far as to try to¬†¬†

48:55
intimidate an American journalist and I got to¬†
tell you it doesn't make you look anything but¬†¬†

49:00
extremely guilty that's what I will say about that¬†
topic I'm now going to before I get into a few of¬†¬†

49:09
your comments um remind you guys about American¬†
financing because I know the average person finds¬†¬†

49:14
it difficult to keep up with monthly expenses in¬†
most cases there is little left at the end of the¬†¬† month to cover any extras most Americans aren't¬†
getting a big raise expenses are up and it is¬†¬†

49:23
very hard to manage without using credit cards¬†
so if you're a homeowner and you're frustrated¬†¬† with that cycle I need you to make a 10-minute no¬†
obligation call today to my friends in American¬†¬†

49:31

hard-earned Equity to work and get you out of debt¬†¬†

49:40
their are salary based mortgage consultants are¬†
saving their customers an average of $800 a month¬†¬†

49:45

make next month's more mortgage payment there are¬†¬† no upfront fees so it costs nothing to find out¬†
how much you could be saving every month so call¬†¬†

49:55

50:05
that's americanfinancing.net ens all right guys¬†
so we are going to Premiere the Xavier pussard¬†¬†

50:12
interview I wanted to do one more episode of this¬†
because there are things that he was speaking¬†¬† about that I wanted to make sense to you when he¬†
talks about the s software that has really saved¬†¬†

50:20
him um from making any errors or or making any¬†
assumptions that would have given them the ability¬†¬†

50:27
to pounce and so uh we will Premiere the first¬†
part of the interview here on YouTube and then¬†¬†

50:32
we will put the rest of it on CandaceOwens.com¬†
uh which is running and amazing thanks to Patmos¬†¬†

50:39
which is the great team that put together um our¬†
website they are the most trusted alternative to¬†¬†

50:45
Big Tech hosting and their service is excellent¬†
the hosting is secure and I'm now officially free¬†¬†

50:50
to say anything that I want on the show without¬†
the fear of being cancelled uh by my web host so¬†¬†

50:56
we're grateful to Patmos Patmos.tech if you're¬†
one of those individuals who is looking for¬†¬† that freedom as well you can make the switch and¬†
have them host things for you at Patmos.tech all¬†¬†

51:07
right let's get into some of your comments I know¬†
some of you guys actually brought the uh bought¬†¬†

51:13
the book already Xavier P's book uh becoming¬†
brijit and you've skipped and learned more and¬†¬†

51:18
like I said I didn't I have not even scratched the¬†
surface and so after we show you our interview we¬†¬†

51:23
will then get into even more because you will have¬†
questions about who they are now trying to go back¬†¬†

51:30
and present and suggest could be Jean Michelle¬†
trno those of you who have gotten there about¬†¬†

51:36
the uh little chubby guy that they're trying to¬†
say Shan Michelle trno who curiously didn't stand¬†¬†

51:41
with his family at the inauguration but stood with¬†
the Rothchilds um we'll get into all of that uh¬†¬†

51:49
in an episode after the interview with Xavier so¬†
that you can put that piece together suffice it to¬†¬†

51:55
say the AI Tech says no that is not John Michelle¬†
trog no this person de hend writes Candace shame¬†¬†

52:03
on you for sending me down this rabbit hole with¬†
you for truth because now I'm all in something is¬†¬† definitely fishy about Mr first gentleman briet¬†
mccrone the gig is up I agree Christine writes¬†¬†

52:14
thank you cace for who you are and all that you¬†
do Chris writes you may remember me from earlier¬†¬† during the year for finding a beautiful Bi Bible¬†
on the ground while walking my dog I attended¬†¬†

52:23
my first Catholic mass this morning and wanted¬†
to share thanks for helping me find Christ God¬†¬† bless you such an amazing amazing story Jessica¬†
Wickers writes I am loving these investigative¬†¬†

52:31
series your thoroughness is amazing with baby¬†
number four on the way and given your previous¬†¬† Hospital experiences are you planning a home birth¬†
or are you working with a midwife I am I would be¬†¬†

52:42
very happy if I had my baby at home my husband¬†
won't let me plan that uh he's like everything's¬†¬†

52:47
been smooth you have very easy pregnancy and¬†
we've had good births I did have one very bad¬†¬† Hospital experience and we ended up checking¬†
my baby out of there that was really more over¬†¬†

52:55
vaccines and Medicine rather than like my birth¬†
actual experience um and so he doesn't want to¬†¬†

53:01
switch up the formula we're at odds there but I¬†
would love to give birth at home so I may just go¬†¬† into labor and not tell him until the baby's just¬†
about to come out uh sis holiday writes point of¬†¬†

53:12
V point of view me asking everyone in my life did¬†
you know the Pres of France's wife is a man yeah¬†¬†

53:18
you know what's interesting is now now you go back¬†
when I first got into the story and I announced¬†¬† it on my previous podcast and the journalists¬†
that instantly rushed to call it insane those¬†¬†

53:27
are people that you should be very concerned of¬†
I call out Barry Weiss all the time because she¬†¬† wrote like a whole article about me people were¬†
trying to use like Sigman Freud uh psychology to¬†¬†

53:39
be like oh she must be having a mental breakdown¬†
could you imagine the trying to assign hysteria to¬†¬†

53:45
someone who's looking into a story of perversion¬†
and pedophilia and grooming what does that tell¬†¬†

53:51
you about our mainstream media apparatus it should¬†
tell you that they do not work for the people they¬†¬†

53:56
work to protect the state and whoever is running¬†
the state and this is a story like I said that is¬†¬†

54:02
global um I think there are two many similarities¬†
between the upbringing of um Emanuel macron and as¬†¬†

54:09
we talked about the upbringing of Camala Camala¬†
Harris the upbringing of Barack Obama you know¬†¬†

54:15
these people being raised by their grandparents at¬†
a time when we know that the MK Ultra program was¬†¬†

54:20
running and there is something very very wrong¬†
there too many comparisons is what I would say¬†¬†

54:28
Luke writes dig dig and dig find out who is hiding¬†
behind this person 47 versus a 14-year-old not¬†¬†

54:35
okay what is going on with the elites this is¬†
bad uh she was uh you meant to say 37 uh sorry¬†¬†

54:42
she was 14 she was 39 Christian foron writes our¬†
sincere salutation to Emanuel mcon bit mcon John¬†¬†

54:50
Michelle trno lilan de Rothchild pedophine oier¬†
and JJ trno who are all one way or another with¬†¬†

54:58
us tonight indeed they are um I'm hearing rumors¬†
that he Emanuel mcon is e e even looking at trying¬†¬†

55:05
to hire people in public relations uh to deal¬†
with the fracturing of his image and tifon is¬†¬†

55:14
quiet I've got a lot of questions about her the¬†
only child that seems to really speak out and¬†¬†

55:20
it's interesting because we like I said don't¬†
know what happened to brijit trau but we know¬†¬†

55:26
that whatever did happen to the real brijit trno¬†
um tfon would have been too young to remember her¬†¬†

55:32
so I find that to be of some interest and that's¬†
why we have created a timeline which we should¬†¬† share with you all so that you can just capture¬†
kind of the movements here like a timeline of¬†¬†

55:42
rajit trno a timeline of Johan Michelle trno sort¬†
of like the wiping and the disappearing of them¬†¬† both the reemergence of rajit uh oier or later¬†
to be Mone is just it's too perfect of a story¬†¬†

55:57
when you start to look at it but anyways you guys¬†
just reminding you if you want to support our work¬†¬† please go to canis ens.com you can give whatever¬†
you want you can also sign up we have an entire¬†¬†

56:06
series on vaccines uh you can also support by¬†
buying my sophomore book which is available for¬†¬†

56:11
pre-sale uh head to CandaceOwens.com there's so¬†
many ways to support independent journalists and¬†¬†

56:17
uh people that are just taking these risks and¬†
telling these stories because I do think that¬†¬† we're experiencing this Global Awakening and¬†
we are realizing that something very dark and¬†¬†

56:24
something very perverse is going on and that¬†
there are too many powers that are trying to¬†¬†

56:29
suppress us having that conversation and it's¬†
going to take all of us kind of supporting one¬†¬†

56:35
another and educating one another in order for us¬†
to realistically be able to change things for our¬†¬†

56:40
children and that's my investment in this by the¬†
way that's my skin in this game is that I've got¬†¬† kids that have to grow up in this world and the¬†
more that I learn about things that have happened¬†¬†

56:48
and things that are are happening it terrifies me¬†
uh and so I uh don't keep my mouth shut how am I¬†¬†

56:53
doing Emanuel mcon I'm shutting up you did tell me¬†
to shut up pretty much in a lot of words in a 100¬†¬† Pages you said don't say anything and I did not¬†
not say anything I failed really bad at not saying¬†¬†

57:06
anything I'm I'm just not good at that it's not¬†
my thing anyways you guys we will see you tomorrow
