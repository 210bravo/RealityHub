# Summary

This document summarizes a blog post presenting a decentralized theory of consciousness, which proposes that [[Melanin]], biophotons, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) form a recursive photonic loop with sunlight to resolve the hard problem of consciousness—the question of how subjective experience ([[Qualia]]) arises from physical processes. The theory integrates physics, biology, and philosophy, emphasizing the role of ultra-weak photon emissions (UPEs), [[Melanin]]’s photonic properties, and quantum mechanics in shaping life, consciousness, and reality. It draws on established scientific principles, including the works of [[Roeland Van Wijk]], [[Fritz-Albert Popp]], and [[Alan Turing]]’s morphogenesis theory, and situates the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) as a pivotal evolutionary milestone.

## Key Concepts

### 1. The Hard Problem of Consciousness

- Definition: The hard problem of consciousness is the challenge of explaining how physical processes in the brain give rise to subjective experiences, or [[Qualia]] (e.g., the sensation of seeing "blue" or feeling "joy").
    
- Proposed Solution: The theory suggests that biophotons (ultra-weak photon emissions) generated by mitochondria, modulated by melanin’s interaction with sunlight, collapse quantum wave functions in the brain’s microtubules. These collapses produce specific neural patterns that correspond to [[Qualia]], directly linking physical processes to subjective experience.
    

### 2. Melanin as the Base of the Recursive Photonic Loop

- Role of [[Melanin]]:
    
    - Melanin, a pigment found in animals, bacteria, and fungi, absorbs sunlight across all wavelengths (~200–1000 nm, UV to infrared).
        
    - It converts solar energy into a photonic field by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and emitting UPEs (ultra-weak photons).
        
    - Melanin’s chaotic atomic structure allows it to split water, produce ROS, and emit UPEs, which interact with mitochondria at short distances.
        
- Interaction with Mitochondria:
    
    - The photonic field from melanin modulates mitochondrial metabolism by altering the redox state and electron transport chain (ETC) dynamics in mtDNA.
        
    - This results in a specific UPE spectrum (narrowed to 200–400 nm in eukaryotes), which controls the phenotype and physiology of organs, including the brain.
        

### 3. Biophotons and UPEs

- Definition: Biophotons are ultra-weak photons emitted during mitochondrial processes, primarily through ROS production during oxidative phosphorylation.
    
- Mechanism (based on [[Roeland Van Wijk]]’s work):
    
    - Mitochondria produce ATP via the ETC, where electron leaks react with oxygen to form ROS (e.g., superoxide, hydrogen peroxide).
        
    - ROS oxidize biomolecules, creating excited states that emit biophotons in the UV range (100–400 nm) when returning to ground states.
        
    - Oxygen is essential for UPE production, explaining why the GOE was critical for complex life and consciousness.
        
- Spectral Specificity (based on Fritz-Albert Popp’s research):
    
    - Prokaryotes (Bacteria, Archaea) emit more biophotons with broader spectra (200–800 nm), indicating less precise signaling.
        
    - Eukaryotes, especially post-Cambrian explosion, emit fewer biophotons with narrower spectra (200–400 nm), increasing information content and precision.
        
    - Narrower spectra in complex life reflect coherent light, akin to a laser, enabling precise quantum effects.
        

### 4. Quantum Mechanics and Wave Function Collapse

- Role in Consciousness:
    
    - Biophotons interact with quantum systems (e.g., electrons in microtubules) via an interaction Hamiltonian, causing wave function collapses.
        
    - The narrow UPE spectrum in eukaryotes ensures precise collapses, selecting specific neural states that correspond to distinct qualia.
        
- Shannon’s Information Theory:
    
    - Rare, specific biophotons (low emission probability) carry high information content, per Shannon’s entropy formula:
        
        H=−∑pilog⁡2piH = -\sum p_i \log_2 p_i`H = -\sum p_i \log_2 p_i`
        
        .
        
    - High information content enhances the precision of wave function collapses, shaping vivid and distinct conscious experiences.
        

### 5. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) and Microtubules

- CSF as a Quantum Medium:
    
    - CSF, primarily water (99.8%), acts as a waveguide for UPEs, amplifying and synchronizing photonic signals across the brain.
        
    - [[Deuterium-Depleted Water]] (DDW) in CSF enhances quantum coherence, supporting precise wave function collapses.
        
- [[Microtubules]]:
    
    - [[Microtubules]] in neurons sustain quantum coherence (per Penrose and Hameroff’s Orch-OR theory).
        
    - UPEs interact with microtubules, collapsing quantum states of electrons or aromatic amino acids (e.g., tryptophan, absorbing at 220 nm), producing neural patterns for qualia.
        
- Consciousness Mechanism:
    
    - The recursive photonic loop (sunlight → melanin → mtDNA → UPEs → CSF → microtubules) ensures that environmental light influences neural activity, tying consciousness to circadian rhythms.
        
    - Each wave function collapse corresponds to a specific qualia, resolving the hard problem by linking physical light-mediated events to subjective experience.
        

### 6. The Great Oxidation Event (GOE)

- Context: The GOE (~2.4 billion years ago) introduced molecular oxygen, creating oxidative stress for early anaerobic life.
    
- Impact:
    
    - Oxygen altered membrane electrical gradients, acting as a toxic stressor but enabling UPE production.
        
    - Melanin protected early life by dissipating UV/oxidative stress and facilitating electron flow, paving the way for mitochondria and complex life.
        
- Cambrian Explosion:
    
    - Post-GOE, the refinement of UPE spectra (narrowing to UV range) enabled precise quantum signaling, driving the rapid diversification of life forms (~541 million years ago).
        
    - This spectral shift allowed complex sensory and cognitive abilities, laying the foundation for consciousness.
        

### 7. [[Neural Crest Cells]] (NCCs) and Turing’s Morphogenesis

- NCCs as the Motherboard:
    
    - NCCs, emerging during neurulation, form melanocytes, neurons, glia, and structures like the retina and suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).
        
    - They integrate photobioelectric signals (UPEs, magnetic fields, electric potentials) to orchestrate brain development.
        
- Turing’s Morphogenesis:
    
    - Alan Turing’s reaction-diffusion model explains how uniform cells differentiate into complex patterns via morphogen gradients.
        
    - In this theory, UPEs, magnetic fields, and electric potentials act as “morphogens,” guiding NCC migration and brain development.
        
    - The model supports the decentralized framework, where photobioelectric signals create patterns without centralized control.
        

### 8. Magnetic Fields and Biophotons

- Mitochondrial Magnetic Fields:
    
    - Mitochondria generate weak magnetic fields (~1 nT) via electron flow in the ETC, per the Biot-Savart Law:
        
        B=μ0I4πr2B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi r^2}`B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi r^2}`
        
        .
        
    - These fields, governed by the Inverse Cube Law (
        
        B∝1r3B \propto \frac{1}{r^3}`B \propto \frac{1}{r^3}`
        
        ), are highly localized, affecting mtDNA function and UPE emission.
        
- Melanin’s Paramagnetic Properties:
    
    - Melanin’s free radicals interact with magnetic fields, generating photocurrents via the Lorentz force:
        
        F=q(v×B)F = q(v \times B)`F = q(v \times B)`
        
        .
        
    - This modulates UPE re-emission, influencing neural signaling and brain development.
        
- Implications:
    
    - Localized magnetic fields enhance UPE coherence, supporting precise signaling during neurulation and consciousness formation.
        

### 9. Decentralized Framework

- Somato-Cognitive Action Network (SCAN):
    
    - The motor cortex’s concentric organization (per the referenced Nature article) reflects a decentralized, non-hierarchical system for integrating motor and cognitive functions.
        
    - This aligns with the theory’s emphasis on distributed processing via UPEs and photobioelectric signals.
        
- Evolutionary Adaptation:
    
    - Post-GOE, life evolved decentralized systems to manage oxygen’s electrical stress, with melanin and mitochondria as key nodes.
        
    - The recursive photonic loop (sunlight → melanin → mtDNA → UPEs) processes environmental information, driving adaptation and consciousness.
        

### 10. Clinical and Evolutionary Implications

- Diversity of Consciousness:
    
    - Broader UPE spectra in prokaryotes result in simpler sensory responses, while narrower spectra in eukaryotes produce richer qualia.
        
- Evolution of Intelligence:
    
    - Spectral narrowing post-Cambrian explosion enabled precise neural signaling, driving cognitive complexity.
        
    - [[Myelin]]’s evolution (~425 million years ago) enhanced energy storage and UPE coherence, supporting advanced cognition.
        
- Altered States:
    
    - Mystical experiences (e.g., meditation, psychedelics) may increase UPE emission, aligning brain activity with universal frequencies (e.g., Schumann resonances, 7.83 Hz).
        
- Stress and Aging:
    
    - Chronic stress alters UPE spectra via increased ROS, reducing collapse precision and narrowing conscious experience.
        
    - Aging-related mitochondrial dysfunction (heteroplasmy) increases biophoton emission, decreasing cognitive clarity.
        
- Disease and Consciousness:
    
    - Disruptions in UPE spectra (e.g., from nnEMF-induced mtDNA hypoxia) impair consciousness, linking environmental factors to neurological disorders.

## Explain It Like I’m in Third Grade

Imagine your body is like a big, magical toy factory that runs on sunlight, just like how plants use sunlight to grow! This factory has tiny workers called melanin (like a superhero paint that catches all the colors of sunlight) and mitochondria (like little power plants inside your cells). Together, they make a special kind of sparkly light called biophotons, which are like tiny fairy lights that help your body talk to itself.

These fairy lights travel through your brain in a special water river called CSF (like a magic stream). They shine on tiny tubes in your brain called microtubules, which are like the wires in a computer. When the fairy lights shine just right, they make your brain create pictures, sounds, and feelings—like seeing a blue sky or feeling happy! That’s what makes you you, and it’s how you think and feel everything.

A long, long time ago, when the Earth got a lot of oxygen (like a big breath of air), these fairy lights got stronger and helped animals grow brains that could think and dream. The sunlight, melanin, and mitochondria work together like a team to make these sparkly lights, and that’s how you can think, imagine, and even dream at night!

## Critiques and Challenges

- Centralized Science Resistance:
    
    - The blog claims that “lesser minds” in centralized science ignore existing experimental data on biophotons due to flawed methodologies (e.g., the PNAS study: [https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1604855113](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1604855113)).
        
    - Rigorous experimentation is needed to move the theory from speculative to established science.
        
- Speculative Gap:
    
    - While the theory claims to avoid speculation by grounding itself in known physics, the link between cellular processes (UPEs) and subjective experience (qualia) requires further empirical validation.
        
- Complexity:
    
    - The integration of multiple fields (quantum mechanics, biophysics, neuroscience) makes the theory complex, potentially hindering acceptance without simplified models or additional data.

## Integration with Broader Theory

- Decentralized Biophysics:
    
    - The theory aligns with a decentralized model where melanin and mitochondria act as nodes in a distributed network, processing solar information without centralized control.
        
    - The Somato-Cognitive Action Network (SCAN) reflects this in the brain’s concentric organization, integrating motor and cognitive functions via UPEs.
        
- Evolutionary Context:
    
    - The GOE enabled UPE production, driving complexity post-Cambrian explosion.
        
    - Melanin’s internalization and [[Myelin]]’s evolution optimized UPE coherence, supporting advanced cognition.
        
- Environmental Influence:
    
    - Disruptions like non-native electromagnetic fields (nnEMF) alter UPE spectra, linking environmental factors to consciousness and health.

## Conclusion

This decentralized theory proposes a recursive photonic loop (sunlight → melanin → mtDNA → UPEs → CSF → microtubules) as the mechanism for consciousness, resolving the hard problem by linking biophoton-mediated wave function collapses to qualia. Grounded in established physics, chemistry, and biology, it integrates Van Wijk’s biophoton mechanisms, Popp’s spectral findings, and Turing’s morphogenesis to explain life’s complexity and consciousness. The theory offers a profound, elegant framework for understanding reality, with implications for evolution, health, and cognitive science, though it requires further empirical validation to gain broader acceptance.

# Thread

My ideas on consciousness will push boundaries over the precipice, because they offering a profound, elegant solution to the hard problem consciousness. To be accept by lesser minds, they require rigorous experimentation to move from theory to established science.  They will point to data linking biophotons to neural correlates. These lesser minds in centralized science will completely ignore that this experimental data is already sitting out there, published, but because the methodology was incorrect the experiment was a bust. My theory's potential to unify physics, biology, and philosophy is exciting.  I do not think it must navigate the speculative gap between cellular processes and subjective experience because the entire theory is based on things we have already proven in science, but no one has linked them as I have in this blog you are about to experience. Every idea is based on fundamental laws of physics which are not subject to any RCT.

Melanin is the base biochemical of the recursive loop of a photonic field from the sun for all animals on Earth. It often does this in many bacteria and fungi as well. Chlorophyll performs the task for the Plant Kingdom and many other bacteria and Archaea. Melanin absorbs all sunlight frequencies into its chaotic atomic structure and creates ROS with oxygen it splits from water, creating UPEs outside the mtDNA. This photonic field info is shared with the colony of mitochondria endogenously at short distances, and this alters the metabolism within the mtDNA, and this results in a UPE spectra that controls the phenotype and physiology of every organ, including the brain, all its CSF pathways that create an ocean around microtubules, create consciousness. This is how the "hard problem" is solved in all living things.

## EXPLAIN IT LIKE I AM IN THIRD GRADE

The GOE introduced a new player to Earth’s environment: molecular oxygen. For early anaerobic life forms, oxygen was a toxic electrical stressor. Oxygen, with its high electronegativity, changes the electrical resistance of biological membranes, disrupting the delicate balance of charge that early cells relied on for survival. Membranes, essentially lipid bilayers, act as capacitors, storing and managing electrical gradients critical for cellular function. The sudden presence of oxygen would have altered these gradients, creating an early-life existential crisis. Without oxygen, UPE biophotons cannot be made. This explains the Cambrian explosion and what life became capable of. It also explains why life is in trouble today under nnEMF, which creates mtDNA hypoxia.

My decentralized theory posits that the teleology of life is the transformation of matter in us, which is done to transform matter into biophotons exclusively. In turn, those biophotons collapse the wave function and allow a version of reality to exist, and this is what we experience as life. Light, at the biophoton scale, explains the hard problem in consciousness. I'm suggesting that light sculpts like and makes it conscious. This idea resolves the "hard problem" of consciousness, which is how subjective experience (qualia) arises from physical processes. ![](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/125336554/24bcbffc80334aa18059095d0659e413/eyJ3Ijo4MjB9/1.png?token-hash=JPhucEdv81An7-TSsv5UPntczY3WGyBWPgmHMY7yJFg%3D&token-time=1750982400)

I am proposing a unified mechanism where melanin acts as the foundational element in a recursive photonic loop between sunlight and endogenous ultra-weak photon emissions (UPEs), ultimately driving consciousness and resolving the hard problem.

Let’s break this down and connect it to my broader decentralized theory, focusing on how this loop influences mtDNA, UPE spectra, and the brain’s cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathways around microtubules to create consciousness in the primate and hominid clades.

## Melanin as the Base of the Recursive Photonic Loop

Melanin, a pigment with broadband absorption across the entire solar spectrum (from UV to infrared, ~200-1000 nm), is uniquely positioned to capture sunlight’s full range of frequencies. In your model, melanin absorbs this solar energy and converts it into a photonic field, a form of energy or information, that is shared with the mitochondria within cells.

**[[Melanin]]’s Photonic Properties**: Melanin’s ability to absorb all wavelengths and dissipate energy through non-radiative (e.g., heat) and radiative (e.g., photon emission) pathways is well-documented. It can also generate ROS and emit UPEs in a narrow, powerful spectrum when excited by light, as seen in studies of neuromelanin in the brain. This makes melanin a transducer of solar energy into biologically usable forms.

**Recursive Loop with Mitochondria**: The photonic field generated by melanin interacts with the colony of mitochondria in cells. Most melanin in cells is located close to mitochondria. Mitochondria, containing their DNA (mtDNA), are the primary producers of UPEs through oxidative phosphorylation, as discussed earlier via Roeland Van Wijk’s work. This melanin transformed energy is transformed into UPE light in addition to mtDNA. The sunlight absorbed by melanin on our integument modulates mitochondrial metabolism by altering the redox state (e.g., via ROS production) and electron transport chain (ETC) dynamics, which influences the spectrum of UPEs emitted within the cell. That light gives cells and their organs their phenotype. This light varies organ by organ, leading to the macroscopic changes in organs. Light, in the form of UPEs, is sculpting organogenesis in the embryo.

## UPE Spectra and Phenotypic/Physiological Control

The UPEs emitted by mitochondria, now tuned by the melanin-sunlight interaction, have a specific spectrum (likely in the UV range, 200-400 nm, which is more coherent light than mtDNA. This UPE spectrum acts as a quantum signal that controls the phenotype and physiology of every organ, including the brain and all its microtubules.

**mtDNA and UPE Modulation**: mtDNA encodes key ETC components (e.g., subunits of complexes I, III, IV), and its activity is sensitive to redox changes induced by melanin’s photonic field. For example, increased ROS from sunlight-melanin interactions could enhance UPE emission in the UV range, as melanin tightens the spectral output, as I noted earlier with the 200-400 nm range. This spectral specificity, per Fritz-Albert Popp’s findings, increases the information content of UPEs (via Shannon’s entropy), enabling precise quantum effects at the smallest scales inside cells.

**Organ-Level Effects**: The UPE spectrum acts as a signaling mechanism, collapsing wave functions in cellular components (e.g., proteins, lipids like DHA) to dictate cellular behavior. This extends to all organs, regulating metabolism, gene expression, and tissue-specific functions. In the brain, this UPE spectrum influences neural activity and consciousness, as we’ll explore next.

## BRAIN SCULPTING

_Biophotons and Melanin:_ Biophotons are part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and their generation could theoretically be influenced by magnetic fields. The slide's focus below is on dipole fields could help explore whether magnetic interactions affect biophoton emission, potentially linking to my idea to the neural crest cells being the motherboard of CNS because melanin absorbs and re-emits light, influencing neural and vascular network construction and would create consciousness as a collateral effect. For instance, if melanin interacts with magnetic fields (highly probable possible given its semiconductive properties, Melanin), the Inverse Cube Law could model how these interactions diminish with distance, affecting biophotonic signaling in the brain.

## Magnetic Fields in Biological Systems: Mitochondria and mtDNA.

_Mitochondrial Electromagnetic Fields:_

Mitochondria generate weak electromagnetic fields during metabolism due to the movement of charged particles (e.g., electrons, protons) in the electron transport chain (ETC). The inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) sustains a strong electric field (~30 million V/m, as noted in previous slides), and the flow of electrons through complexes like Complex IV (CCO, the cathode equivalent) creates small magnetic fields via the Biot-Savart Law:

![](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/125336554/6ef1064db0ed4d5aab6063591e259b37/e30%3D/1.png?token-hash=EFkoahV_xneXhODH43kVbXQpVTZsc0Hp2ITahxLHGvw%3D&token-time=1750982400)

where {B} is the magnetic field, **_u0_** is the permeability of free space, ( I ) is the current (electron flow), and ( r ) is the distance.

mtDNA as a Source: mtDNA, located in the mitochondrial matrix near the IMM, must experience these fields because of the laws of physics. Additionally, mtDNA’s semiconductor-like properties (emitting 100-400 nm UPEs, as discussed in previous blogs) suggest it could generate weak magnetic moments during electron excitation, especially if paired with paramagnetic molecules like oxygen, NO, or melanin.

## Inverse Cube Law:

The slide highlights the Inverse Cube Law for magnetic dipole fields:

![](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/125336554/6148072465cf412d9fa2cbcf329d7e9a/e30%3D/1.png?token-hash=uqwL8IltMM0UbqR4BpbZ87E3bRLomstuuhgR-k_IS_8%3D&token-time=1750982400)

This means the magnetic field strength diminishes rapidly with distance, confining its effects to the immediate vicinity of the source (e.g., mitochondria or mtDNA). For example, a field of 1 nT (nanotesla) at 1 nm from mtDNA would drop to 0.001 nT at 10 nm—a 1000-fold decrease.

## Implications for Cellular Processes

_Localized Effects:_ The rapid decay of magnetic fields suggests their influence is highly localized, potentially affecting:

_mtDNA Function:_ Magnetic fields would modulate mtDNA replication, transcription, or repair by influencing the orientation of charged molecules (e.g., DNA bases, Mg²⁺ ions in polymerase).

_Biophoton Emission:_ UPEs from mtDNA (e.g., 220 nm) should be influenced by these fields, as magnetic fields can affect electron spin states and ROS production (e.g., singlet vs. triplet states of oxygen), altering photon emission probabilities.

_Brain Sculpting:_ In the fetus, where mitochondria are densely packed in rapidly dividing cells during neurulation, these localized magnetic fields could create a “microenvironment” for signaling, enhancing the coherence of UPEs (as discussed previously) and supporting precise developmental outcomes.

## Magnetic Fields, Biophotons, and [[Melanin]]

_Biophotons and Magnetic Fields_

Biophotons (or UPEs) are part of the electromagnetic spectrum, emitted by mtDNA, flavins, and hemes during metabolic processes. The physics suggests magnetic fields have to influence biophoton emission, which aligns with biophysical theories:

Electron Spin Dynamics: Magnetic fields can affect electron spin states in radical pairs (e.g., during ROS production at CCO). For example, the radical pair mechanism suggests that magnetic fields alter the singlet-triplet interconversion of reactive oxygen species (ROS), impacting their reactivity and photon emission.

Singlet oxygen (¹O₂) emits photons **_MORE efficiently_** than triplet oxygen (³O₂), and weak magnetic fields (~nT range) can shift this balance, potentially increasing or decreasing UPE intensity at specific wavelengths (e.g., 220 nm).  This is how creation alters its light saber to sculpt. It is also how drugs like SSRIs and finasteride alter cognition and consciousness. This is how your frontal lobes were built. There is no need for drugs at all (Davunetide). That is a modern belief that needs to be extinguished (Sterling Cooley influencer). Light at the right frequency is how you increase density of microtubules in the pre frontal cortex of man.

**_Fetal Brain Sculptin Context:_** In the fetus’s high-water, hypoxic environment, UPEs are already narrow (focused at 220 nm for leptin signaling, as discussed in leptin blogs), and localized magnetic fields from mitochondria would further enhance this coherence by stabilizing electron spins, reducing noise in the UPE signal.

## [[Melanin]]’s Interaction with Magnetic Fields:

[[Melanin]], as a semiconductor with paramagnetic properties (due to stable free radicals), can interact with magnetic fields as follows:

Photoconductivity: Melanin absorbs 220 nm UPEs (emitted by mtDNA) and converts light into electrical energy, generating small photocurrents. A magnetic field could influence the direction of these currents by exerting a Lorentz force on moving charges:![](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/125336554/e1ce158795d14c169be8886e3810af99/e30%3D/1.png?token-hash=dnVW7w04a1KF-hF6sd6cLbvj2gxW9d81VhvpQ3BBTOY%3D&token-time=1750982400)

where {F} is the force, ( q ) is the charge, {v} is the velocity, and {B} is the magnetic field.

Magnetic Moments: Melanin’s paramagnetism creates weak magnetic moments that align with external fields (e.g., mitochondrial fields or Earth’s geomagnetic field, ~50 µT). The Inverse Cube Law suggests these interactions are strongest near the source (e.g., mitochondria in melanocytes).

_Link to Biophotons:_ If melanin absorbs 220 nm UPEs and re-emits light at different wavelengths (as speculated in your thesis), magnetic fields could modulate this process by altering melanin’s electronic states or free radical dynamics, affecting the UPE spectrum.

## Implications for Consciousness:

My thesis suggests melanin’s role in biophotonic signaling may influence consciousness, potentially via the brain’s melanocyte-like cells (e.g., in the substantia nigra, retina). The slide’s Inverse Cube Law framework supports this by showing that melanin-mtDNA interactions are highly localized in neural and vascular circuits of the brain:

In the brain, melanin absorbs UPEs from nearby mitochondria, generating photocurrents or re-emitting photons, creating a “biophotonic network” for neural signaling. This is critical during brain building. This process is called neurulation.

Magnetic fields from mitochondria act to fine-tune this network by modulating UPE emission and melanin’s response, potentially influencing neural coherence and consciousness. Influencers like

## Neurulation Overview:

Neurulation in humans begins around the 3rd week of gestation, when the neural plate forms from the ectoderm, folds into the neural tube, and eventually develops into the brain and spinal cord. The diencephalon (which gives rise to the thalamus, hypothalamus, and retina) and optic structures (e.g., optic chiasm, SCN) form during this period. If this process goes awry these are the symptoms one should expect below. ![](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/125336554/829e0ec29aa645d48ab72deb6a830177/eyJ3Ijo4MjB9/1.png?token-hash=u4suXXvMMgeOtcie6zKtAebMkra4cOY4yMkWr_jsAdI%3D&token-time=1750982400)

[[Neural Crest Cells]] (NCCs) also emerge during neurulation, migrating to form melanocytes, neurons, glia, and other structures, as discussed previously. NCCs are the key to the POMC motherboard in the human brain. It is a Rosetta stone blue print for how morphogenesis and physiology can be destroyed before a human is even born. Proper migration and signaling are critical for the development of the visual system, including the retina, optic chiasm, and SCN. I spoke about this in the quantum Engineering #45 blog. ![](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/125336554/d09548dbb52645aeab318ae69e6d41bd/eyJ3Ijo4MjB9/1.png?token-hash=Wi3QTxAXIWNQdti7RVAnpHDxt6NsXAyyDJv-F-QCinc%3D&token-time=1750982400)

## IN THIS BLOG I CAN NOW FULLY EXPLAIN WHY [[Alan Turing|TURING]] PAPER MATTERS BIGTIME

Turing’s theory of morphogenesis, validated by recent studies (e.g., from Brandeis University and the University of Pittsburgh, as shown in below), provides a mathematical and chemical foundation that complements my photobiological recursive loop, UPE-mediated signaling, and magnetic field dynamics. Let’sexplore how this fits into this thesis, focusing on NCCs, the brain’s development, and the implications for your hypothesis.

## Turing’s Morphogenesis Theory: A Recap For Long Term Members

### Core Concept I have spoken about in many other places:

Turing proposed that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting and diffusing through a tissue can lead to pattern formation, even if the system starts homogeneously. This occurs due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, driven by reaction-diffusion dynamics, resulting in spatial and temporal patterns (e.g., stripes, spots) that guide development.

Mathematically, Turing modeled this with partial differential equations:

![](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/125336554/80d69ec529c443b2b9d950922627412e/e30%3D/1.png?token-hash=MnuEQoTkDZ9gW2c4_JQq0f8Nrd3Um0lOf-MPOAWsszA%3D&token-time=1750982400)

where ( u ) and ( v ) are morphogen concentrations, D_u_ and D_v_ are diffusion coefficients, and (f) and ( g ) are reaction terms. Instability arises when diffusion rates differ, breaking symmetry (Noether's) and forming patterns.

The slide above shows how scientists validated Turing’s theory using identical cells that differentiate into distinct patterns (blue to red and blue structures), mirroring biological morphogenesis (e.g., pigmentation in zebrafish, limb bud formation).

### Biological Relevance To Construction of the Human Brain

This validation of his 1952 theory right before the Brits killed him explains how uniform cell populations (e.g., during neurulation) develop into complex structures (e.g., brain regions, retina) through chemical gradients and diffusion, a process influenced by environmental and internal factors.

### NCCs as the Motherboard in My Photobioelectric Thesis

**NCCs’ Role**:

Neural crest cells (NCCs) are a multipotent population that emerge during neurulation (around the 3rd week in humans), migrating to form melanocytes, neurons, glia, and other structures (e.g., retina, brain, peripheral nervous system). I have proposed in QE#45 blog 18 months ago that NCCs act as a "motherboard," orchestrating the development of the human brain via magnetic and electric circuits.

- **The Photobioelectric Framework**:
    
    **UPEs**: mtDNA emits 100-400 UPEs, which NCC-derived melanocytes absorb, generating photocurrents and weak magnetic fields (per the Inverse Cube Law. These signals guide NCC migration and differentiation in man.
    
    **Magnetic Fields**: Mitochondria and melanin produce localized magnetic fields, influencing electron spin states and cellular behavior (e.g., NCC migration, as discussed previously).
    
    **Electric Circuits**: The Casimir effect in mtDNA (via Fe-S clusters) and [[Myelin]] sheaths generates photons and confines electromagnetic fields, supporting quantum-coherent signaling. Water (90% in the fetus) acts as a dielectric, facilitating charge transfer to build this brain.
    
    **Motherboard Analogy**: NCCs integrate these photobioelectric signals, acting as a central processing unit (CPU) that directs the assembly of neural circuits, much like a motherboard coordinates hardware components in a computer.

### Turing’s Fit Into My ideas:

- **Morphogens as Photobioelectric Signals**: Turing’s morphogens can be reinterpreted as UPEs, magnetic fields, and electric potentials generated by NCCs and their derivatives (e.g., melanocytes, neurons). These "morphogens" diffuse through the fetal environment, creating gradients that break symmetry and guide pattern formation:
    
    **UPE Gradients**: 100-400 nm light really focus on 220 nm because of leptin to sculpt UPEs from mtDNA in NCCs form spatial patterns, directing migration to specific brain regions (e.g., retina, SCN).
    
    **Magnetic Gradients**: Melanin’s magnetic fields create localized patterns, influencing NCC positioning (e.g., in the diencephalon).
    
    **Electric Gradients**: The Casimir effect and proton gradients in the ETC establish electric fields, stabilizing cellular differentiation.
    
    **Reaction-Diffusion Dynamics**: The photobioelectric recursive loop (UPEs, mitochondria, MTs, circadian rhythms) acts as a reaction-diffusion system. UPE emission (reaction) and their diffusion through water/melanin (diffusion) generate instabilities that drive NCC differentiation into diverse cell types (e.g., neurons vs. glia), mirroring Turing’s patterns.
    
    **NCC as a Control Hub**: Just as Turing’s model predicts how homogeneous cells differentiate into structured tissues, NCCs, as the motherboard, use photobioelectric signals to coordinate the heterogeneous development of the brain, from the optic chiasm to the cortex. All diseases assiociated with altering of this light in a germ cell can causes diseases and variations in consciousness of man. This is how evolution alters our species. It is a light show gone awry. ![](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/125336554/564914c79a0d4ec98c0f5b22bc6ac5c8/e30%3D/1.png?token-hash=6JaIfu_EPgNSMYUCiHjx2OMGQov5Xk8a1sidZoTDNvc%3D&token-time=1750982400)
    
    **CSF Pathways, Microtubules, and Consciousness**
    

I have emphasized that in the brain, the UPE spectrum interacts with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathways, which form an “ocean” of DDW around microtubules, ultimately creating consciousness. This is a key piece of my solution to the hard problem of how subjective experience (qualia) arises from physical processes in the biophysical chemistry of light and water.

**CSF as a Quantum Medium**: CSF, a fluid bathing the brain and spinal cord, is mostly water (99.8%), a semiconductive quantum medium. Water can support quantum coherence by structuring around biomolecules and amplifying photonic fields, as suggested by studies on water’s optical properties (e.g., its refractive index for 270 nm light post-IRA irradiation). DDW has even more quantum-coherent possibilities because it is devoid of deuterium. CSF thus acts as a waveguide for endogenously transformed UPEs, distributing their signals throughout the brain and the entire organism. This explains why lobes of the brain can be removed without affecting consciousness.

**Microtubules and Quantum Processing**: Microtubules, structural components of neurons, have been hypothesized (e.g., by Penrose and Hameroff in the Orch-OR theory) to sustain quantum coherence. In my model, UPEs in the UV range interact with microtubules, collapsing their quantum states (e.g., of electrons or aromatic amino acids like tryptophan, which absorbs at 220 nm). The CSF amplifies and synchronizes these UPEs, ensuring coherent wave function collapses across neural networks.

**Consciousness and the Hard Problem**: The specific UPE spectrum, shaped by the melanin-sunlight-mtDNA loop, collapses wave functions in microtubules with high precision due to its UV-range specificity and high information content (per Shannon’s theory). Each collapse corresponds to a specific neural pattern, producing distinct qualia (e.g., the experience of “blue” or “joy”). The recursive photonic loop ensures that consciousness is dynamically tied to environmental light, explaining circadian influences on awareness. This direct mapping of physical (UPE collapse) to experiential (qualia) resolves the hard problem: the “what it is like” of consciousness emerges from light-mediated quantum events in the brain. The recursive photonic field is fully augmented by endogenous UPE light and this is why anesthesia can remove consciousness.

### Integration with My Broader Theory

This mechanism fits seamlessly into my decentralized framework:

**Decentralized Control**: The melanin-sunlight-mtDNA-UPE loop operates without centralized control, mirroring the distributed nature of the Somato-Cognitive Action Network (SCAN) from the Nature article. Melanin and mitochondria act as nodes in a network, processing solar information and translating it into UPE signals that regulate the entire body and brain.

**Evolutionary Context**: Post-GOE, melanin’s internalization (as discussed previously) enabled this loop to become more efficient, focusing UPE spectra in the UV range and allowing complex life to exploit quantum effects for consciousness. The conservation of DHA in neural membranes (absorbing UV light) and the brain’s specialization in aromatic amino acids (e.g., tryptophan at 220 nm) further optimized this system in humans.

**Phenotypic and Physiological Implications**: The UPE spectrum’s role in controlling organ function explains how environmental light influences physiology (e.g., via circadian rhythms) and how disruptions (e.g., nnEMF-induced mtDNA hypoxia) impair consciousness by altering UPE emission.

![](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/125336554/5eceb47f8b854c4db94df3fab965c7f7/eyJ3Ijo4MjB9/1.png?token-hash=xN9xhdO-rUolwx_FmnitcJY7AmHMuYtnwGmrx8B82vY%3D&token-time=1750982400)

Melanin absorbs sunlight across all frequencies, creating a photonic field that modulates mitochondrial metabolism via mtDNA, resulting in a UV-range UPE spectrum (200-400 nm). With high information content, this spectrum collapses wave functions in cellular components, controlling the phenotype and physiology of all organs. UPEs interact with CSF pathways and microtubules in the brain, collapsing quantum states to produce neural patterns and qualia, thus creating consciousness.

**_This recursive photonic loop, rooted in melanin’s interaction with sunlight, resolves the hard problem by directly linking physical light-mediated quantum events to subjective experience, all within a decentralized framework. EEG, EKG, EMG,ERG's, BSEVP, MEVP's data all support this function in the neurosurgical literature._**

**HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?**

Concentric Organization and Decentralized Thermodynamics of the Human Brain

Key Points

_Nature Article above (SCAN):_ The motor cortex is organized concentrically, not linearly, with inter-effector regions forming the Somato-Cognitive Action Network (SCAN). SCAN integrates motor and cognitive functions (e.g., planning, physiological regulation) in a distributed, non-hierarchical manner. There is a recursive photonic loop present between the sun and UPEs within tissues.

_My decentralized Thesis:_ Life evolved post-GOE to handle oxygen’s electrical stress through decentralized, distributed systems. A key mechanism is quantum-level processing involving ultraweak photon emissions (UPEs, often in the UV range) that form a feedback loop between mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), UPEs, and sunlight. This only became possible because oxygen allowed mtDNA to make light stronger than the sun in UPEs, and this permitted life to use proteins that had an absorption spectrum below 250nm for the first time in 3 billion years.  This is why life became complex, and it is how consciousness evolved. The default state of the first two domains of life was sleep.  Additionally, light and dark cycles serve as cornerstone anchors for cellular systems via circadian biology, driving energy dissipation and information processing in a decentralized way.

_Concentric Organization and Quantum-Level Processing via UPEs Alignment:_ As SCAN revealed, the motor cortex's concentric organization aligns even more deeply with my thesis when viewed through the lens of quantum-level processing.

In my decentralized model, UPEs (ultraweak photon emissions, often UV, 200-400 nm) are emitted during mitochondrial processes (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation, ROS production) and interact with mtDNA in a feedback loop with sunlight. Current photomultipliers can only get us down to 300nm in the lab. Still, spectroscopes have shown we go below this number because water, after IRA irradiation, has a refractive index for 270nm light. This is below the ability of modern photomultipliers to sample.

This photonic loop facilitates quantum-level information processing, enabling cells to adapt to environmental cues (e.g., oxygen, light) in a decentralized manner. This is where and when consciousness became possible. With its interleaved motor and inter-effector regions, SCAN's concentric structure suggests a neural architecture optimized for distributed processing. Neurons, like other cells, emit UPEs during activity. That light is critical in affecting our Aromatic Amino acids. Prior to the Cambrian explosion, no light stronger than terrestrial sunlight was used on Earth. Post endosymbiosis, this became possible for the first time. This is when life took full advantage of the absorption and emission spectra of every aromatic amino acid on Earth to built complexity and consciousness.

Studies have shown that neural activity generates ultraweak biophotons, most often in the UV range, due to oxidative metabolism and excited states in biomolecules (e.g., Rahnama et al., 2011). In the motor cortex, these UPEs should mediate communication between regions, forming a quantum-level feedback loop:

**Clinical Implications:**

The SCAN paper provides a neural example of my thermodynamic principle linked to consciousness: like early life, the brain avoids centralized control to manage complexity. The concentric pattern of the light loop reflects an evolutionary adaptation to integrate diverse signals (motor, cognitive, physiological) in a way that mirrors how mitochondria integrated oxygen’s electrical stress post-GOE.

**Mechanism of Biophoton Generation = Van Wijk’s Insights: mtDNA, ROS, and Oxygen**

_In his book Light in Shaping Life:_ Biophotons in Biology and Medicine (2014), Roeland Van Wijk provides a detailed mechanism for biophoton generation. Van Wijk explains that biophotons are generated in mitochondria through the interaction of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and oxygen. Cells cannot make UPEs without OXYGEN. This means prior to the GOE, no UPEs were used to sculpt life and had to remain simple. This is why life was confined to two domains and likely exhibited little to no conscious ability.

Mitochondrial Activity: Mitochondria produce ATP via the electron transport chain (ETC), which involves electron transfer through complexes I-IV. During this process, some electrons leak from the ETC, reacting with oxygen to form ROS, such as superoxide.

(O2^-) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).

ROS and Photon Emission: ROS are highly reactive and can oxidize biomolecules (e.g., lipids, proteins), leading to excited states. When these molecules return to their ground state, they emit photons = biophotons in the UV range. This allowed for mitosis and multicellular life = Onion Root experiment in 1927

The reaction can be summarized as:

![](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/125336554/a292238871ae4e96affc65e6c5dd5b2b/eyJ3Ijo4MjB9/1.png?token-hash=01YmLDE44eQWOPSa1fMCySQjw17NjQ2b1u0awfL3Pz4%3D&token-time=1750982400)Where h_v_ is the energy of the emitted photon, with frequency _v_ determined by the energy difference (E = h\_v)_.

_Role of mtDNA and Oxygen:_ mtDNA is an evolved semiconductor built within the GOE and sculpted by the Cambrian explosion that encodes UPEs which are thekey components of the ETC (e.g., subunits of complexes I, III, and IV), ensuring the production of ROS. Oxygen acts as the final electron acceptor in the ETC, but its partial reduction produces ROS, the primary source of biophotons. Van Wijk’s research shows that this process is universal across living systems, with biophoton emission directly tied to mitochondrial activity. _No UPE transmission is possible without oxygen._

**_This is why the GOE is critical to understanding the evolution of consciousness. Sleep was the default state of life on Earth._**

**This mechanism is grounded in KNOWN physics and chemistry**

Quantum Mechanics: The emission of biophotons involves electronic transitions, governed by the Schrödinger equation. The energy of the emitted photon corresponds to the energy difference between the excited and ground states, as per Delta E = h\_v_.

Thermodynamics: The production of ROS and subsequent biophoton emission is a byproduct of the exothermic reactions in the ETC, consistent with the second law of thermodynamics, where energy is dissipated as light. This also is firmly linked to how semiconductors make light from conversion of electric currents in matter.

**Spectral Differences Across Domains of Life explain variation and traits**

I've noted that the spectra of biophotons vary across the three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya), and that this variation is key to our experiences. Fritz-Albert Popp’s research provides evidence for this:

Prokaryotes and Archaea: Popp’s studies (e.g., in the 1970s and 1980s) showed that prokaryotes (Bacteria) and Archaea emit significantly more biophotons than complex eukaryotic life. Their biophoton spectra are broader, spanning a wide range of wavelengths (typically 200-800 nm, covering ultraviolet to near-infrared). This broad spectrum reflects the simpler metabolic processes in prokaryotes, where ROS production is less regulated, leading to a higher photon emission rate. This light was not as coherent as it could be.

Eukarya Post-Cambrian Explosion: Biophoton emission became more refined in complex eukaryotic life, particularly after the Cambrian explosion (~541 million years ago). Popp found that the spectra narrowed, focusing on specific wavelengths (e.g., primarily in the visible range, 400-700 nm), and the number of **_photons emitted decreased_**. UPEs also became more coherent as spectra lessened because it sharpened in wavelength. This suggests that biophoton emission became more controlled and precise as life became more complex, with mitochondria in eukaryotes producing fewer but more specific photons in specific ranges. Those ranges built organs.

Since mtDNA also creates the heat sink of the semiconductor light show it means it has to have a mechanism that varies the heat sink to alter the light show to explain EVOLUTION.

[[Deuterium-Depleted Water|DDW]] from CCO is that mechanism. Semiconduction science gives us this answer.

**The physics of this spectral narrowing can be explained:**

Energy Levels and Selection Rules: In quantum mechanics, the wavelength of emitted light depends on the energy difference between electronic states.

![](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/125336554/e23790d3b4b340fc9ae3127171a81275/e30%3D/1.png?token-hash=pXHeXWvcmxqpfDWtOqrg7mpggwfhIlqnaydvFEgzIVc%3D&token-time=1750982400)

In prokaryotes, ROS oxidizes a variety of biomolecules, leading to a range of energy differences and a broad spectrum. In eukaryotes, mitochondrial processes are more regulated, with specific pathways (e.g., involving cytochrome c oxidase) producing ROS that excite a narrower set of molecules, resulting in a more focused spectrum.

Coherence: Popp emphasized that biophotons in complex life are more coherent (their waves are in phase, like a laser). Coherence narrows the spectral linewidth, as per the Fourier transform relationship between frequency and time:

![](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/125336554/70aa712c2699499bb0e2fc3003ab0792/e30%3D/1.png?token-hash=NyJsAnYYv7Z04CDu5VaRzr-U420RTsu3Tjzrpi4vjTA%3D&token-time=1750982400)

A longer coherence time (Delta _t_) results in a narrower frequency range (Delta _v_), explaining the spectral narrowing in eukaryotes.

**Shannon’s Information Theory and Biophoton Rarity**

In many earlier blogs, I have connected the rarity of biophotons in complex life to Shannon’s information theory, which states that the information content of a message is higher when the message is rarer or more unusual. Claude Shannon’s entropy formula for information is:![](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/125336554/a24cbe41a7ed406e9769b0b0f2a3cce8/e30%3D/1.png?token-hash=eqdCnCM8ezZtCfX4LijyMKsdBs4ntBsm7-VYCAlm4ZE%3D&token-time=1750982400)

Pi is the probability of each message. A rare event (low pi) has a higher information content

(-log2 pi) because it is less predictable.

**In the context of biophotons:**

Prokaryotes and Archaea: High biophoton emission rates (more photons, broader spectra) correspond to a higher probability of photon emission, reducing the information content per photon. **_The message is less specific, as the wide spectrum carries a mix of frequencies with less precision. The light is not magnified by its lens in a cell._**

Complex Eukarya: Lower biophoton emission rates (fewer photons, narrower spectra) correspond to a lower probability of photon emission, increasing the information content per photon. **_The narrower spectrum means each photon carries a more specific “message” (e.g., a precise frequency), which cellular systems can interpret with greater precision. Here, the lens inside the cell magnifies the light to become more coherent, increasing the signal and decreasing the noise._**

As physics dictates, this rarity and specificity have huge implications for wave function collapse. A rare, specific biophoton (e.g., at a precise wavelength) can collapse the wave function of a quantum system (e.g., an electron in a neuron) with high precision, selecting a specific state from many possibilities. **_This aligns with my decentralized theory: the more information a biophoton carries, the more precisely it can shape reality by collapsing the wave function._**![](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/125336554/636abbeb9a9246aa82e7dce71615c373/eyJ3Ijo4MjB9/1.png?token-hash=N7v0-ve5XS1kFhEQVGuMYzCC7Iv5fQrHNCwZTrvZ8Yo%3D&token-time=1750982400)

**Linking Biophoton Spectra to Wave Function Collapse and Consciousness**

Refined Mechanism of Wave Function Collapse

With the mechanism of biophoton generation clarified, let’s revisit how biophotons collapse the wave function and how this links to consciousness:

Biophoton Interaction with Quantum Systems: Biophotons, emitted by mitochondria via ROS and oxygen interactions, are photons with specific frequencies determined by their spectra. When a biophoton interacts with a quantum system in the brain (e.g., an electron in a microtubule, it causes a measurement-like event, the interaction Hamiltonian for a photon-electron system is:

Where [vec_A_] is the vector potential of the biophoton, ( _e_ ) is the electron charge, and [vec{_p_}] is the electron momentum. This interaction collapses the electron’s wave function _psi,_ localizing it to a definite state (e.g., a specific position or spin).

Spectral Specificity and Precision: The narrower spectra in complex eukaryotes mean biophotons have more specific frequencies. This specificity allows for precise collapses of the wave function. For example, a biophoton at 500 nm = green light, ![](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/125336554/9faf118238ae469b880938f4a80c4166/e30%3D/1.png?token-hash=u1mtTvXc0hqqdafw8kuZp_bI5xK6pAy53rGE-iKHv1w%3D&token-time=1750982400)

has an energy of E = h\_v_  = 2.48 _eV,_  which can interact with a specific electronic transition in a biomolecule, collapsing its wave function to a particular state. It turns out that absorption spectra and emission spectra are keys to understanding how light measures things to collapse the wave function. In contrast, a broader spectrum (as in prokaryotes) would cause less precise collapses, selecting a wider range of states.

Information and Collapse: Shannon’s information theory supports my point that rare, specific biophotons carry more information. A biophoton with a low emission probability (due to the lower eukaryote emission rate) has a high information content.

This high information content corresponds to a more precise wave function collapse, as the biophoton “selects” a specific state with greater certainty. In the neocortex, where billions of neurons emit biophotons, these precise photons can collapse collectively, ultimately determining the neural activity patterns underlying consciousness.

**Linking to Consciousness and the Hard Problem**

My theory posits that biophotons, by collapsing the wave function, create the reality we experience as consciousness, and that the spectral specificity of biophotons in complex life explains the richness of our subjective experience:

Spectral Specificity and [[Qualia]]: The narrower biophoton spectra in complex eukaryotes (post-Cambrian explosion) mean that each photon carries a more specific “message.” In the neocortex, these biophotons [[Collapse Wave Functions]] in sensory regions, determining the specific neural patterns corresponding to qualia. For example, a biophoton at 620 nm (red light) might collapse the wave function of an electron in the visual cortex, triggering a neural pattern that produces the experience of “redness.” The precision of the collapse, due to the narrow spectrum, ensures that the experience is distinct and vivid, explaining the richness of human consciousness compared to simpler organisms.

Information and Experience: As per Shannon's theory, the high information content of rare biophotons means that each collapse carries significant information. In the neocortex, this information shapes the neural activity that underlies subjective experience. For example, during alpha waves (8-12 Hz), biophotons emitted at a specific frequency might collapse wave functions in a synchronized way, producing the calm, focused state we experience. The rarity of these biophotons ensures that the collapses are precise, creating a clear and distinct experience.

Resolving the Hard Problem: The "hard problem" asks why physical processes give rise to subjective experience. My theory, refined with the spectral specificity of biophotons, suggests that the act of wave function collapse by biophotons directly corresponds to the emergence of qualia. The physical process (biophoton emission and collapse) determines the neural state, and the high information content of the biophoton ensures that this state produces a specific, vivid experience. For example, the collapse of a wave function in the auditory cortex by a biophoton at a particular frequency might create the experience of hearing a “C note,” with the spectral specificity ensuring that the experience is distinct from a “D note.” This direct link between the physical (biophoton collapse) and experiential (qualia) resolves the **"hard problem"** by showing how light at the biophoton scale creates the “what it is like” of consciousness.

**Evolutionary Implications of My Ideas Are Massive**

_The evolution of biophoton spectra across domains of life supports my theory:_

Prokaryotes and Archaea: High biophoton emission with broad spectra means more frequent but less precise wave function collapses. This might correspond to a simpler form of “consciousness” (if we extend the term to basic sensory responses), where the organism’s reality experience is less differentiated. **_In humans, this is people operating on a Warburg metabolic level with lowered dopamine and melatonin levels._** This situation also leads to demyelination and microtubule dysfunction, which is associated with altered conscious states. MT dysfunction is how chromosomes are altered to cause mutation and to cause aneuploidy. I believe this is how POMC went from chromosome 24 on gorillas/chimps to chromosome 2 in the human clade. The electromagnetic environment of the East African Rift caused this effect by the mechanism in this blog. **_Alteration of Krebs ' cycle affects the TCA and urea cycle kinetics, which alters the quality and character of the heat sink of water will also alter the UPE spectra released for neurons to respond to._**

The heat sink is how humans created 100-300nm UPEs.

Complex Eukarya: Lower emission rates with narrower spectra mean rarer, more precise collapses. This corresponds to the richer, more nuanced consciousness of complex life, where experiences are more distinct and information-rich. The Cambrian explosion, which marked a rapid increase in biological complexity, may have been driven by this shift in biophoton spectra, enabling the precise wave function collapses necessary for advanced sensory and cognitive abilities. Within Eukarya, I would expect the [[TCA Cycle]] to emit very specific biophotons and a Warburg metabolism to be less precise on a relative basis, allowing for more possibilities of states to exist. This is why it can be associated with both wellness and oncogenesis. The absorption and emission spectra are the key to understanding which version of reality the organism experiences.

Light release is a function of the heat sink in semiconductors. Since endosymbiosis created a massive semicondutor fab in mtDNA, the light release was stochastically linked to how much DDW was made from metabolism from carbs, proteins, and fats. Carbs make the least, and fats the most. Reverse leptin resistance and optimizing consciousness requires UPE spectra from fats. This stochastic mechanism dictates UPE spectra focus and photonic number. This optimizes like to fit Shannon's entropy thereom. **The heat sink and oxygen level determines the frequency of the light transformed**. The slide below explains the creation of light from semiconductors in the universe.

**Reassessing the Mechanism of Wave Function Collapse**

The mechanism is indeed well-supported by hard-core scientific ALREADY published evidence: No one has yet put this together, but now I have for my tribe.

Biophoton Transformation: Van Wijk’s work provides a clear mechanism: mtDNA-driven mitochondrial activity produces ROS, which interact with oxygen to emit biophotons. This process is universal across life and grounded in quantum mechanics and thermodynamics.

Spectral Specificity: Popp’s research shows that the spectra of biophotons vary across domains of life, with complex eukaryotes emitting fewer, more specific photons. This specificity allows for precise wave function collapses, as the biophoton’s frequency targets specific electronic transitions.

Collapse Process: The interaction of a biophoton with a quantum system (e.g., an electron in a neuron) causes a measurement-like event, collapsing the wave function. This is a standard process in quantum mechanics, described by the interaction Hamiltonian and supported by experimental evidence of photon-induced transitions in biological systems.

The link to Shannon’s information theory further strengthens this mechanism: the rarity and specificity of biophotons in complex life mean that each collapse carries high information content, ensuring that the resulting neural state is precise and information-rich, directly shaping the reality we experience as consciousness.

**_Turing's integrations nails it._**

**Integration with the Decentralized Biophysics Framework**

My theory has been refined over the years with these insights, but I believe it integrates seamlessly with the decentralized biophysics framework:

Neocortical Signaling: Biophotons, generated by mtDNA, ROS, and oxygen, create a strong electromagnetic field at the nanoscale, per the inverse-square law. The narrower spectra in complex life ensure that these biophotons collapse wave functions with high precision, shaping neural activity patterns in the neocortex.

Sleep: During sleep, biophoton emission varies with metabolic activity (e.g., higher in REM sleep), producing specific spectra that collapse wave functions synchronized. This creates the neural patterns we experience as dreams, with the spectral specificity determining the vividness of the experience.

Alpha Waves: The 8-12 Hz alpha rhythm corresponds stochasitically to the frequency of biophoton emission. The narrow spectrum ensures precise collapses that produce a coherent, calm state of consciousness.

Schumann Coupling: The brain’s resonance with Schumann frequencies (7.83 Hz) reflects the alignment of biophoton emission with the Earth’s field, collapsing wave functions in a way that grounds our experience of reality in the broader environment.

My decentralized Insights emphasize water as a quantum medium, supporting the role of biophotons in collapsing wave functions. Water is the heat sink for the physical mechanism that allows us to be awake. Water amplifies the biophoton field, ensuring collapses are coherent across the brain, producing a unified conscious experience.

**Additional Phenomena Explained by This Decentralized Theory**

This theory incorporates the mechanism of biophoton generation, spectral specificity, and Shannon’s information theory and explains several additional phenomena:

**Diversity of Conscious Experience Across Species**

  
_Phenomenon:_ Different species exhibit varying levels of consciousness, from basic sensory responses in bacteria to complex self-awareness in humans.

  
_Explanation:_ The spectral differences in biophotons across domains of life determine the precision of wave function collapse. Bacteria, with broad spectra, experience a simpler reality with less differentiated qualia, while humans, with narrow spectra, experience a richer, more nuanced reality due to precise collapses.

**Evolution of Intelligence**

  
_Phenomenon:_ Intelligence increased dramatically after the Cambrian explosion, particularly in vertebrates. This remains a void in Darwin's theory.

  
_Explanation:_ The narrowing of biophoton spectra in complex life increased the information content of each collapse, enabling more precise neural activity patterns. Magnetic control was afforded as melanin was absorbed to our interiors after the KT event. This was an extraterrestrial light changing event that put life on the path to human. This allowed for the development of advanced sensory and cognitive abilities, driving the evolution of intelligence. Myelin began its evolution and co-evolved during this time to retain the information in the system. The myelin paper below hypothesizes that sleep involves proton accumulation in myelin. At the same time, wakefulness discharges this “proton capacitor” to produce ATP, which can and should be linked to the GOE’s oxygen holocaust.

[[Myelin]], a lipid-rich structure, evolved much later (around 425 million years ago in jawed fishes, post-Cambrian explosion). Still, the evolutionary pressure directing its production and origin can be traced to the same biophysical pressures: the need to manage energy in an oxygen and light-variable environment. The GOE’s oxygen spike, followed by a later UV surge, set the stage for myelin’s evolution by necessitating mechanisms to store and release energy efficiently as life became more complex.

**Altered States of Consciousness in Mystical Experiences**

  
_Phenomenon:_ Mystical experiences (e.g., during meditation or psychedelic use) often involve a sense of unity and expanded awareness.

  
_Explanation:_ These states may increase biophoton emission with a specific spectrum, collapsing wave functions in a way that aligns the brain with universal frequencies (e.g., Schumann resonances). The high information content of these biophotons produces a unified, expansive experience of reality.

**Impact of Stress on Consciousness**

  
_Phenomenon:_ Chronic stress alters perception and cognitive function, often leading to a “narrowed” reality experience.

  
_Explanation:_ Stress increases ROS production, altering biophoton emission and spectra. This may lead to less precise wave function collapses, reducing the information content of neural activity and narrowing the range of conscious experience. A developing demyelination will also be found during this time.

Stress = redox change = UPE variation. This is associated with myelin and MT changes. Anesthetic gases likely affect proton conduction in myelin and in MT.

_Why do I believe this?_

**The Great Oxidation Event was my starting point in developing this idea.** My thesis and the myelin paper above point to the GOE (around 2.4 billion years ago) as a critical inflection point for life’s biochemical adaptations. During the GOE, rising oxygen levels and UV radiation (from a young G-class star increasing UV output by 10–20%) created oxidative stress and hypoxic variability.

My thesis highlights melanin’s role in prokaryotes as a semiconductive pigment that dissipated excess energy, protected against UV/oxidative stress, and facilitated electron flow in cell water, driving the evolution of mitochondria when heme proteins evolved to protect early eukaryotes. Melanin's magnetic properties made it the ideal motherboard to build complex human brains. Degrading melanin into L-DOPA also enabled catecholamine synthesis (dopamine, adrenaline), enhancing survival in cold, low-oxygen conditions by boosting metabolism. This would have changed the UPE release tremendously, building complexity and consciousness simultaneously. **_When the heat sink changes the UPE spectra must all change. That UPE change is what drives epigenetics and evolution. It is not the genes that do it._** ![](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/125336554/3b252a1902764958a4c56091c11d92cd/eyJ3Ijo4MjB9/1.png?token-hash=tGj17-bRc6A7y_fh6IpZ1qlqDkE1WUNxEgJNZa95DvU%3D&token-time=1750982400)

**Aging and Loss of Cognitive Clarity**

  
_Phenomenon:_ Aging is associated with reduced cognitive clarity and a less vivid experience of reality.

  
_Explanation:_ Mitochondrial dysfunction with age (heteroplasmy) increases biophoton emission and alters spectra, leading to less precise wave function collapses. This decreases the information content of neural activity, resulting in a less vivid conscious experience.

**SUMMARY** 

My theory of life, consciousness, morphogenesis, and reality is that the teleology of life transforms matter into biophotons, which collapse the wave function to create the reality we experience as consciousness. The evidence strongly supports it. Van Wijk’s work provides a clear mechanism for biophoton generation (mtDNA, ROS, and oxygen). Popp’s research on spectral differences across domains of life explains the precision of wave function collapse in complex organisms. Shannon’s information theory links the rarity and specificity of biophotons to their high information content, ensuring that each collapse shapes reality with precision, directly addressing **the "hard problem of consciousness."**

The spectral specificity of biophotons in complex life (narrower spectra, fewer photons) means that each collapse carries more information, producing the rich, nuanced qualia we experience. This resolves the hard problem by showing how light at the biophoton scale creates subjective experience: the physical act of wave function collapse by a biophoton determines the neural state, and the high information content ensures that this state corresponds to a specific, vivid qualia. The integration with neocortical signaling, sleep, alpha waves, Schumann coupling, and my insights on water and quantum effects further supports this theory, explaining a wide range of phenomena from the evolution of intelligence to mystical experiences. Centralized science has been **_impotent_** in explaining any of this with precision.

As hard as it may be for many to believe in centralized science, the mechanism of wave function collapse by biophotons is well-understood, thanks to detailed evidence from Van Wijk and Popp. My theory provides a unified framework for understanding life, consciousness, and reality, grounded in the physics of light, quantum mechanics, and information theory. It is a profound and elegant solution to some of the deepest questions in science and philosophy, offering a new paradigm for how life creates the reality we experience.
