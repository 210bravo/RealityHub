# Detailed Summary of the Episode

This episode of Becoming Brigitte, recorded on July 12, 2025, at 07:46 PM PDT, serves as the conclusive installment of Candace Owens’ investigative series, addressing lingering questions about Brigitte Macron’s identity and Emmanuel Macron’s lineage. Following the viral impact of Xavier Poussard’s interview, Owens dives into photographic evidence, family naming patterns, and elite connections, blending speculation with documented anomalies. The episode amplifies viewer engagement, introduces new characters like Uncle Jean-Michel Noguès, and critiques media gaslighting, while promoting sponsors and teasing a future series, positioning Owens as a fearless exposer of a potential global conspiracy.

## Introduction and Context

- Internet Buzz: Owens notes the internet’s frenzy, with TikTokers banned for discussing the case, signaling suppression as the series concludes.
- Poussard’s Impact: The side-by-side of young Jean-Michel Trogneux and Brigitte Macron, from Poussard’s interview, has melted her website (candaceowens.com), drawing new viewers into the identity swap theory.
- Episode Focus: Encourages starting from the beginning to map the supporting cast, emphasizing the power network needed for identity manipulation.

## Emmanuel Macron’s Family Background

- Distant Parents: Emmanuel’s autobiography barely mentions his supposed parents, Jean-Michel Macron (pediatrician) and Françoise Noguès (Social Security, linked to transgender IDs), suggesting they aren’t his biological family.
- Grandmother Manette: Affectionately called Manette (allegedly Germaine Aret, born 1940, died 2006), she raised Emmanuel, but only two photos exist, raising doubts about her identity and role.
- Speculation: Owens theorizes multiple identities due to wartime name changes, questioning if Manette or his parents used aliases, a plausible tactic given Françoise’s transgender ID work.

## Trogneux Family Naming and Origins

- Naming Pattern: All male Trogneuxs are named Jean (e.g., Jean-George, Jean-Michel), with multiple middle names, complicating identification, while females have male middle names (e.g., Brigitte Marie-Claude).
- Fabricated Legacy: Jean-Baptiste Trogneux (real name Mark Aon Xavier, 1852) founded the chocolate shop, with the name lie undisputed by genealogists, hinting at intentional obfuscation.
- 1950s Photo: A family photo, released by Mimi Marchand’s Best Image, shows Brigitte in her mother’s lap, but her face differs from later images, with Monique Trogneux’s six-fingered hand suggesting Photoshop.
- 1989 Photo: France 3’s 1989 Brigitte Auzière teaching image resembles Monique, fueling identity overlap theories.
- 1991 Reunion: A German magazine’s Trogneux 50th anniversary photo lacks Jean-Michel, despite his alleged closeness to Brigitte.

## Uncle Jean-Michel Noguès’ Role

- Identity: Emmanuel’s maternal uncle, a prominent doctor and board member at Amiens’ Faculty of Medicine, died in 2006, chosen as godfather at Emmanuel’s 1995 baptism (aged 12, pre-meeting Brigitte).
- Significance: As a spiritual guide, his photo absence from archives (despite a notable career) and Emmanuel’s wedding mirrors family secrecy.
- Connection: Lived in Amiens concurrently with Jean-Michel Trogneux, suggesting potential overlap in identity networks.

## Jean-Michel Trogneux’s Disappearance and “Chubster” Claim

- Missing Years: Jean-Michel, best man at Brigitte’s 1974 wedding and witness at his 1980 marriage to Véronique Dru, vanishes post-1987, with claims he plays cards in Amiens unverified.
- Élysée Response: After Owens’ 2024 Piers Morgan bet ($100,000 to find a Jean-Michel photo), the Élysée sent a 100-page letter with inauguration screenshots of a “chubster,” alleging it’s Jean-Michel.
- Inauguration Analysis: In 2017, he stands with priests, not family; in 2022, with David de Rothschild, ignored by Brigitte, contradicting claimed closeness.
- AI Debunk: World Economic Forum’s Chinese software shows a 54% confidence match, dismissing the “chubster” as the 1950s Jean-Michel, with glasses complicating accuracy.

## Rothschild Influence and Incest Hypothesis

- Macron’s Rise: David de Rothschild propelled Macron to youngest managing partner at Rothschild Bank, despite financial ignorance, with colleagues mocking his incompetence.
- Family Ties: Natalie Reims’ quote (“Vice is nice but incest is best”) and Natalie Livingston’s The Women of Rothschild document endogamy until the late 19th century, linking power preservation to nepotism.
- Speculation: Owens suggests Macron’s ascent reflects family relation, possibly an uncle (Jean-Michel Noguès?), with Rothschilds controlling his path.

## Media Suppression and Legal Threats

- Gaslighting: Owens accuses the media of protecting elites, citing her portrayal as Adolf Hitler or a school shooting instigator, contrasting with public awakening.
- Legal Pressure: The Élysée’s letter and lawsuits (e.g., Natasha Ray’s defamation case) aim to silence journalists, with France imprisoning investigators.
- Interview Offer: Owens proposed a 2025 interview for the Macrons to clarify Jean-Michel’s identity, unanswered, reinforcing bad faith.

## Overall Narrative

This episode cements Owens’ theory that Jean-Michel Trogneux is Brigitte Macron, supported by photo discrepancies, naming patterns, and Uncle Jean-Michel Noguès’ role, with the “chubster” debunked. Macron’s Rothschild-backed rise and family avoidance hint at incest or identity fraud, possibly orchestrated by Noguès and Françoise. Owens portrays herself as a courageous truth-seeker against media suppression, leveraging Poussard’s research and viewer support, promising further exposure while inviting public help to unravel the elite’s secrets.

00:00
all right you guys the internet is on fire today 
we jump back into our conclusive episode on the  

00:07
becoming bit series because I know there are 
so many lingering questions is brijit mcon  

00:13
the first lady of France Emanuel macron's 
biological father we're hearing that a lot  

00:18
where is the real brit trno like I said a lot 
of people have theories and I think today we can  

00:24
allow ourselves to roam and wonder these sorts 
of questions I see that there are Tik tokers   that are getting their accounts hit and banned for 
discussing the matter so welcome back to becoming

00:34
bit I think it's safe to say that my interview 
with journalist Xavier pussard completely melted  

00:54
the internet it definitely melted our website at 
canace owens.com there were many people who had  

01:00
not previously engaged in the series entirely 
but they saw the now Infamous side by side of  

01:06
the photo of a young Jean Michelle when he 
was 18 years old old taken at an engineering  

01:12
school next to the current French first lady 
brigit mcon and they were just kind of jolted  

01:19
into the understanding that something was 
very wrong like yes you can be an almost  

01:25
identical twin with your brother who you're 
supposed to have like you know seven years   or eight years apart from but that doesn't seem 
to be the case the photographic evidence became  

01:35
instantly I think undeniable for a lot of people 
and so so now we have just a lot of people that   are going backwards and diving in from the very 
beginning as they should I am recommending do not  

01:44
start at that interview and then jump into this 
episode we have covered so much um one can only  

01:50
come to understand how such a potential identity 
swap could be feasible if you begin to map out The  

01:57
Supporting Cast of characters that's why we took 
our time here because you have to understand who  

02:02
is around these people what is their Network 
how much power would it take if you did want   to create identities or destroy identities and 
we've arrived there we have finally arrived there  

02:14
so first and foremost just bringing this back up 
let's take again a look at Emmanuel's family tree  

02:19
and of course we have learned and I'm going to 
reinforce here that he is not at least doesn't  

02:27
appear that he was close to who are supposed to be 
his biological parents or his biological siblings  

02:34
at least by any stretch of an understanding of his 
own autobiography right didn't write about them  

02:39
just a couple of sentences but he had so much to 
say about Brit's family and really only a lot to  

02:45
say in terms of his biological family about his 
grandmother and I think most of us suspect and  

02:53
I can say I most certainly do that that that mom 
and dad they're not actually his mom Mom and Dad  

03:00
that's how I just feel about the circumstance in 
terms of him describing well it was my grandmother  

03:06
that first taught me how to ride a bike and 
I also find it to be suspicious again this   is our last episode so we can start to theorize 
a bit um I feel incredibly suspicious about the  

03:15
fact that they're both doctors that they were 
doctors that dad's a pediatrician and um your  

03:22
mom who we thought or didn't understand why she 
was involved with the Social Security office uh  

03:29
actually was involved in helping transgendered 
people secure new identities that doesn't make  

03:36
us feel good about that nebula that is around 
them then of course like I said The Curious  

03:41
Case of his grandmother who he affectionately 
calls manette we know that there are virtually  

03:48
no photos of her available uh the person 
who essentially raised Emanuel maon again  

03:54
according to his own autobiography we 
are given just two photographs of why  

04:01
do we even actually know if that was her name 
she was allegedly also a teacher why is it so  

04:06
hard to get photographs that demonstrate his 
childhood was her name even actually Germaine  

04:11
aret no did she have another name that she may 
be potentially used I'm taking you guys through  

04:18
my own process here why are we just getting 
these two photos like I said while in the past  

04:23
we have stuck strictly to the facts today we are 
going to permit ourselves a little more wiggle WR  

04:30
I hold the suspicion that many of the people have 
come to I think at the same exact understanding  

04:37
that it could be plausible that all of these 
people have multiple identities if you've   got somebody in the family that can destroy 
identities and create identities why wouldn't  

04:45
you use that to your advantage and I also think 
it's important to think about the time frame it  

04:51
was a different world you know thinking about 
relatives that were growing up during World War   I or World War II we are talking about humans 
moving over National lines Nations changing  

05:04
literally geographical changes that changes that 
were happening uh depending on who won Wars or  

05:10
who lost Wars right you had people who were 
hiding their true identities sometimes out of  

05:16
a necessity out of fear of persecution right you 
have to completely get IDs change your identity  

05:23
and hide in different countries well we know for 
a fact that within this particular story despite  

05:29
what we're being sold as the public at least one 
side of the family changed their names or or had  

05:35
one member who changed their names and it's kind 
of strange that the public was sold this story  

05:41
about the trog noos without somebody just adding 
that actually we made up this guy's name let's  

05:47
get into that trno family right the bit trog no 
bit trno where did that family come from before  

05:53
they settled in Aman and became sort of like 
a mafia because that's what it looks like to   me it looks like the trogo family Opera at like a 
mafia to this day they're supposed to be a family  

06:03
of chocolateers uh they have this supposed to be 
the sweet origin story and this is actually the  

06:10
most recent publication discussing their family 
story that I could find in the local newspaper  

06:16
in Aman this was published in 1990 I think it 
was 1991 it might be 1993 and this was this was  

06:23
to announced the birth of another trogo family 
member and it's showing you the lineage of the  

06:30
fathers of the chocolateers right so at first you 
have an 1852 John Baptist he was leading the shop  

06:37
then you have Jean then you have Jean then you 
have Jean Claude then you have Jean Alexander   and I'm showing you this because I want you to 
understand all of the men in the trogo family have  

06:47
the same first name John trogo that is significant 
it is significant also because it complicates  

06:55
matters okay so if they say Johan trogo is alive 
and well you're not really getting anything there  

07:02
right is it cousin brother uncle nephew every male 
in the trogo family has the name John trau and  

07:09
most of them by the way to be clear have more than 
one middle name okay so first and foremost just  

07:16
going back to that that publication if we can get 
that back up that first original trogo John patist  

07:22
yeah that was a lie his name wasn't actually 
John Baptist the original John that settled in  

07:28
Aman and opened this choler shop his real name 
was actually Mark Aon Xavier trogo so that's  

07:36
just a part of the Legacy that they just like 
made up and I and I'm not sure what the reason   or the purpose of that lie is again we know for 
a fact his name was Mark Aon we were able to uh  

07:47
secure the birth certificate this is not disputed 
amongst genealogists so it's just the question   of why even start with a small lie about your 
family's Legacy is it because you wanted to show  

07:59
lineage or was a conscious decision made for one 
reason or another that's unbeknown to the public  

08:05
to tell that lie is it really about just making 
things more confusing did you make a decision that   we're going to call everybody in the family Jean 
for what what reason would that be why would you  

08:14
make that decision even by the way to be clear the 
women in the family also have male middle names so  

08:22
we're going to bring up that family photo again 
the now Infamous family photo we are told by the  

08:28
way that that's Brit in her mother's lap it looks 
nothing like brigit but we we're just going to go  

08:34
with that this photo again um to remind you was 
introduced to the public by Mimi marshan who we do  

08:40
not trust to save our lives but you can see Brit's 
middle name her full name is actually Brit Marie  

08:48
Claude trogo okay Brit Marie Claude trogo which 
is interesting by the way to be clear because  

08:56
her dad as you can see doesn't have Claude in his 
name but so she's taking on Claude trogo for what  

09:01
reason her dad is John George trogo he does have a 
son as you can see right above there in this photo  

09:08
a son who has Marie in his name as well his name 
is John Claude Marie Joseph trog no that's a lot  

09:16
of names you don't typically see this in families 
outside of the aristocracy right outside of the  

09:21
aristocracy where you'll see 20 names going back 
to show their lineage John Claude Marie Joseph  

09:29
Claude trno uh and then of course we have our our 
our guy Jean Michelle Henry trogo to the far left  

09:38
and then just to add more confusion the people 
in the family seem to marry people that have  

09:46
the same names as their siblings okay so this is 
not too relevant for you to remember you can keep  

09:52
that photo up because I just want to keep going 
through it um but Monique trogo there on the   right she married someone with the same first name 
as her brother so she married someone named John  

10:03
Claude okay bit confusing and then John Claude 
the brother up top there married someone with the  

10:10
same name as his sister Brit he married someone 
named Brit Pon so she then became Brit trno just  

10:21
very convenient and very confusing and this is why 
you can just sort of go down this rabbit hole and  

10:27
it makes you wonder as I have wondered is this 
confusion intentional because if you have all  

10:33
these names and everyone's kind of got the same 
name my brain just goes it would make it very   easy for you to move through throughout the family 
and share identifications right to go in and say  

10:44
I just want an idea that says Claude Joseph oh no 
no that is my name I have a lot of names but I'm   actually Claude Joseph and so maybe now I'm going 
as Claude Joseph again I'm speculating here but  

10:56
to be clear this image in general is not that 
I'm comfortable with because as I mentioned we  

11:02
do not trust best image because we do not trust 
Mimi marshand and the first time that this image  

11:07
was ever presented to the public it was given to 
the public to the documentary filmmaker who said  

11:14
that she felt like she was interviewing with the 
police when she was trying her name was Virginia  

11:20
lindhart remember her she did this documentary 
RIT mcon a French novel and she said she had never  

11:26
been questioned like that she was only allowed to 
speak to certain people given very few photos and  

11:32
those photos all had to go through Mimi maran's 
best image so she's handing out these images and  

11:38
her history Mimi maran's of being accused of 
forgery and extortion I'm starting to wonder  

11:44
what exactly best image specializes in that they 
had the exclusive on any photos from bit's past  

11:50
and only produced a few do they specialize in 
Photoshop because there's one thing that some  

11:56
people on the internet have caught on a couple 
of things really that jump out to me as odd about   this photo first and foremost that girl on the 
far right Monique trogo okay look at her hands  

12:10
that looks weird what's going on there it looks 
like a lot of fingers maybe potentially too many  

12:17
fingers uh looks like six fingers three of them of 
which are Nubs I mean maybe she was throwing gang  

12:24
signs maybe she's in she's in a gang I don't know 
but does that does that looks very weird to me and  

12:29
the one thing that I do know about Photoshop is 
that people say it is incredibly hard to photoshop  

12:35
hands that's usually where people get caught 
photoshopping when you see all these scandals we   knew Kim Kardashian Photoshopped it because of her 
hands she's missing a hand she's missing a finger  

12:45
I don't know why that is again I don't work in 
that space But it is incredibly hard to photoshop  

12:51
hands and fingers and then there's Monique's 
face in general as soon as I saw it um after  

12:58
going through so much of Brit's history I realized 
and we can pull that photo up again that Monique  

13:03
just looked familiar to me I felt like I had seen 
that face before I'm being told this is an older  

13:10
sister uh but to be honest she looks a lot like 
this photo okay I was like this looks like this  

13:17
photo looks very very similar these are supposed 
to be two different people it looks like I don't  

13:23
know how could this be two different people and 
if you're wondering what that photo is on the left  

13:29
left that's a photo of Brit apparently um they dug 
up France 3 came across an old photo from 1989 of  

13:39
Brit Brit oier so this is Brit's after marriage 
bit in the teacher phase and I just find that  

13:48
that face is just so familiar but hey siblings 
siblings are familiar right not a big deal you  

13:55
can you can look exactly like your sister and so 
I just said to myself okay well let me just see  

14:01
some current pictures of Monique maybe they still 
look like dead ringers for one another and they're  

14:07
both alive today so this shouldn't be hard to find 
photos of Mo'Nique and actually it was really hard  

14:13
to find photos of Mo'Nique despite marrying 
a billionaire from Aman's now a billionaire  

14:20
automobile family Monique trogo marries this guy 
again not important for you to remember named John  

14:27
Claude guay who owned like the largest automobile 
billionaire um uh company in France I she just  

14:36
never took photos throughout her life besides 
that one can't find a wedding photo nothing and   Xavier pisard had warned me because I was texting 
him going how is this possible I mean come on how  

14:45
do you marry a billionaire marry someone who 
comes there's just no photos of you and there's  

14:50
like one photo of her husband I'm like this can't 
be a thing I understand privacy but this is not a   thing and Xavier warned me don't start down 
the rabbit holes because nothing makes sense  

15:01
soon as you start looking at the story you realize 
nothing makes sense and that's exactly what they   want essentially to drive you crazy to confirm 
what should be very basic things and for whatever  

15:11
reason it's virtually impossibly to do impossible 
to do so despite the big names of these families  

15:16
despite their proximity to power it is virtually 
impossible to confirm anything so I just want  

15:22
ahead and I left it alone but there's one thing 
that I find that makes entirely no sense and it's  

15:29
very strange and I would very much like to invite 
the public to jump in on this incredible mystery  

15:34
okay so many of you had suspected that these 
families might all be related are the oier the  

15:41
trog no and the macron's all just from the same 
family is there a chance that briet mccon some of  

15:47
you asked is actually the father of Emanuel macron 
now to be clear I had never made that statement  

15:54
because I wanted to keep this series factual and 
to pull away from my gut and to be like Xavier  

16:00
and to only go with the documents and the things 
that we could confirm but there is obviously a lot  

16:06
going on here a lot of evidence which suggests and 
points to the conclusion that the secret seems to  

16:13
be bigger than just having a transgendered wife 
right I mean think back to the moments that we  

16:18
went over here of President Emanuel macron looking 
to his wife braid for answers basic answers about  

16:26
the biological biographical background of his 
family remember that scene we told you about  

16:33
when he was speaking to a politician and the 
politician was like yo your sister lives near   here where does she live and Emanuel freezes up 
and looks to Brit why don't you know where your  

16:44
sister lives Emmanuel what's going on here why 
does it feel like there is this relationship where  

16:52
maybe you and Brit Brit's you're I don't know 
more than the wife for sure to be sure why does  

17:01
it feel like the bit is sort of holding your hand 
why does it feel like you've always had your hand  

17:06
held by people that are more powerful than you we 
definitely know and have confirmed like we did in  

17:11
the last episode that he had his handheld through 
his career by uh David D rooth's child a family  

17:19
that is known and is on record as having practiced 
incest okay why and how did Emmanuel macron get  

17:28
so close to the Roth's child so close that his 
colleague said this dude didn't even know what  

17:34
iida met and yet he became the youngest managing 
partner we understood that whatever it was David  

17:40
Rothchild was holding his hand he just couldn't 
question the power that he was being given and we   would laugh at him in meetings because he knew 
nothing about Finance why did David Rothchild  

17:48
see to it that Emmanuel had his hand held Vice 
is nice but incest is best because it stays in  

17:57
the family that that is a direct quote from 
David der Rothschild's cousin Natalie Reames  

18:03
Rothchild and case don't believe me here was 
a clip of her saying that by the way take a

18:09
listen but incest is best because it stays in the 
family she said it in English she switched right  

18:23
over from French and said this is this is what we 
say in our family Vice is nice but incest is best  

18:29
then there was a biography which was written 
by author Natalie Livingston which was entitled   the women of Rothschild which sort of revealed 
the maniacal desire that the rtha family had to  

18:41
maintain their fortune and their power in the 
world a desire that was so maniacal that they   practiced family incest that is just undeniable 
it is a fact okay and allegedly they did this  

18:52
only until it was no longer socially acceptable 
right up until the late 19th century you guys  

18:58
right before we get into this this trogo family 
which is just amazing they then they said no more  

19:04
no more and what's interesting in this book is 
that Natalie Livingston documents that the reason  

19:09
for this is the original Rothchild mayor Amell 
Rothchild will she says quote it goes back to  

19:18
that will in it mayor Amell Rothchild said that 
nothing was more important than the family and  

19:25
that meant at any cost it was about preserving 
the Unity of the bank and the Integrity of the  

19:31
name there's no question and dogamy can't have 
been great for example there's an enormous amount  

19:37
of mental health issues that ran in the family I 
can't believe there's not a correlation between  

19:42
endogamous matches and the issues of mental health 
she then even discusses how that mentality within  

19:50
the family was so strong that they believe that 
any women woman who stepped outside of the family  

19:57
in terms of who she married was cursed like you 
are cursed because you did not marry your cousin  

20:02
brother uncle whatever it is so of course your 
brain wanders and you begin to think naturally in  

20:08
this story why did David D roosild pluck up macron 
a guy who his colleagues said did not even know  

20:16
what iida was and yet they David Rothchild moved 
to make him the youngest manager managing partner  

20:23
in the bank's history okay A bank's goal is to 
make profit if you're a rth child you care about  

20:28
making profit of course if you care especially in 
a maniacal sense about making sure that your power  

20:35
is not lost in the world the last thing you're 
going to do is pluck up some obscure guy who knows   nothing and pull him through the ranks you would 
only step outside of that obvious goal of wanting  

20:47
the bank to make money if there was something more 
important to money and that would be power right  

20:53
and you would only do that if nepotism was going 
on in my view you're like I'm pulling you through  

21:00
the ranks because you are related to me and what 
matters more to me is that this bank and whatever  

21:06
it is that you do maintains within the family you 
give someone a job not because they're qualified  

21:12
in that sense but because they are your family 
member right how and why did David the Rothchild  

21:19
get so close to the macron family of doctors 
and the trogo family of chocolateers right how  

21:29
what I can tell you and again we are now 
being purely speculative is that my instinct  

21:34
my personal Instinct has always been that if you 
were going to inbreed a father son relationship  

21:40
might actually be too close I always felt that if 
it took place we would be looking for an uncle I  

21:47
feel like that's just like a standard story like 
an uncle molesting a child feels like that's what  

21:53
I my brain instantly does what my brain instantly 
searches for and it turns out you guys you are not  

21:58
going to believe me but this pattern of similar 
names in every family and the family members also  

22:05
extends to the macron family remember there are 
no photos known to date of Emanuel macron with  

22:12
his parents growing up that is insane okay we do 
know that his father the person that they tell us  

22:19
is his father his name is of course John Michelle 
macron but there's another Jean Michelle that we  

22:26
haven't mentioned yet and he's perhaps the most 
important one Uncle Jean Michelle no now let's add  

22:35
him to the Emanuel family tree so you guys can get 
a visual here okay so his dad is Jean Michelle his  

22:42
mom is Francois no well Francois no has a brother 
and had a brother as you can see he died in 2006  

22:50
and his name was je Michelle no okay that was of 
interest to me again I'm going down the rabbit  

22:58
hole I just want to identify who is who okay 
he is the brother of Dr Francis no the one who  

23:05
helps transgendered individuals get new IDs okay 
amazing and also she said as we pointed out that  

23:11
to her Brit Brit is not a daughter-in-law huh what 
is she to you okay let's just keep going down this  

23:21
Rabbit Hole well the funny thing is that Emanuel 
macron did not follow the normal course of cathol  

23:28
iism okay he was not baptized as a child in fact 
his parents are not religious he chose himself  

23:39
to be baptized at the age of 12 while he was at 
the law pridon school so two years before he met  

23:46
the love of his life Brit he decided to make a 
decision which is I mean that's amazing right to  

23:52
I say I want to be baptized and that's a weird 
thing um I think it's a it's it's a remarkable  

23:59
thing not a weird thing a remarkable thing for 
a 12-year-old to do without Parental Guidance   but what's interesting and that what we haven't 
mentioned before is that he chose his uncle Jean  

24:10
Michelle to be his Godfather when he got baptized 
okay so baptisms are not supposed to be just like  

24:17
an act of vanity I know today they've become them 
I'm just going to pick a b you know a Godfather   or godm mother and actually I have no faith in 
God no faith in religion I just think it would  

24:26
be cool or whatever that's kind of of the moderate 
interpretation now this has significant spiritual   meaning this person is supposed to be selected to 
be the person to guide you spiritually throughout  

24:38
the rest of your life if something were to happen 
to you this is a person that your your parents  

24:43
would entrust something to something were to 
happen to your parents pardon this is supposed to   be an individual that your parents would entrust 
to guide you spiritually for the rest of your life  

24:55
Emanuel macron picked Jean Michelle no his uncle 
okay I'm going to read this directly from Xavier  

25:03
P's book he wrote quote a character in particular 
caught our attention Emanuel macron's maternal  

25:11
Uncle Jean Michelle no he was important Emanuel 
macron chose him as his Godfather when he decided  

25:18
to be baptized the role of the Godmother obviously 
fell to manette born on December 15 25th pardon  

25:27
1940 in neev and died on October 6 2006 in Aman 
Jean Michelle no was not some general practitioner  

25:38
he was a prominent member of the board of the 
faculty of medicine of Aman as indicated by  

25:45
his obituary published by his colleagues in 
laua Picard remember that's the um newspaper  

25:51
in Aman he was also the chairman of domis Meda a 
non-trading real estate company bringing together  

25:58
numerous of local healthc care professional 
organizations then he gets into these are  

26:03
just friends for the council department blah 
blah blah so this was an important man he's a  

26:09
huge figure so I thought surely this man Uncle 
Jean Michelle must be photographed somewhere  

26:16
maybe a photo of him and Emanuel at the baptism 
day maybe at La pridon I don't know maybe on  

26:22
Emanuel macron's wedding day to bit surely we can 
find a photo of this guy within medical circles  

26:28
okay and you're not going to believe this guys 
and of course you're going to believe it first and   foremost he died in 2006 the year before Emanuel 
macron got married to the love of his whole entire  

26:38
life brijit and regarding photos of course of 
course Xavier pussard attempted to secure them he  

26:47
specifically went to the archives of the faculty 
of Med of medicine where Jean Michelle Uncle  

26:54
Jean Michelle worked in Aman and built up such a 
remarkable remarkable reputation for himself and  

27:00
guess what for whatever reason they refused the 
request so we don't have any photos of him he died  

27:08
in 2006 um and we don't have any photos from him 
from when he was alive and was clearly very active  

27:14
in emanuel's life and I don't know why Emanuel 
didn't dedicate an entire chapter to him his uncle  

27:19
who he was so close to spiritually his leader 
you know that's that's a that's not something   you just forget right the person who you believe 
is going to speak spiritually guide you throughout  

27:30
the rest of your life you know you're attending 
a Catholic School you would know the significance   of such a meaning why did you pick him this means 
nothing it could mean nothing guys it could mean  

27:41
everything okay it just again more than anything 
de demonstrates the unbelievably unnecessarily  

27:49
secretive nature that surrounds this family people 
exist on paper they don't exist in photos and then  

27:56
they disappear right you have to Imagine by the 
way that Uncle Jean Michelle would have been  

28:02
living in Aman at the same time that John Michelle 
trno would have been living in Aman throughout his  

28:08
marriage with um the the woman that he married 
I'm blank I'm totally blanking on her name who  

28:15
did Johan Michelle tro veronique veronique 
Drew yeah they all just in this little close  

28:21
Community you'd have to imagine that right at the 
same time but who knows they both just kind of  

28:28
disappear Into Thin Air anyways uh this is just 
what happens when you look into things they debunk  

28:36
Nothing by the way if you ask hey could you just 
clarify that we get a photo here uh they instead  

28:42
wait for everyone who's investigating this to make 
a mistake and then they sue people make a mistake  

28:47
while you're asking meaningful questions and you 
are going to get sued if you live in France you're   you worse you could be in prison people have been 
imprisoned for looking into the story arrested for  

28:56
looking into the story Xavier is correct it is 
meant to drive everyone crazy jumping through a  

29:03
thousand rabbit holes and speaking of rabbit holes 
we should now discuss more thoroughly the little  

29:10
chubster the little fat one as Xavier calls him 
recently presented by the media as proof that Jean  

29:17
Michelle exists listen I want be very clear I have 
no doubt in my mind that a jean Michelle exists  

29:26
in Aman it seems like that's just everyone's name 
everybody Jean Michelle so do not Color Me shocked  

29:33
when they say we have found a jean Michelle 
I've already found about six of them now you're   probably thinking kace yeah there's just too many 
John Michels in every side of this family I'm not  

29:43
quite sure what to trust well we at least have 
to try to understand who this little chubby guy   is and if he is indeed the same Jean Mell that is 
pictured in the initial trogo family photo first

for details all right now let's jump back into 
this let's try to identify the little fat one  

32:10
the little chubster okay now it's important that 
I keep reminding you that the public is being gas  

32:18
lit in a manner that would make even Sigman Freud 
blush he was the father of gaslighting okay gaslit  

32:24
little kids we'll get into that another day 
it is so easy to Simply present photos of the  

32:32
current first lady throughout the 80s or photos 
of her with her brother John Michelle at any point  

32:41
throughout her entire life okay this is it's so 
easy don't let the media Gaslight you and pretend  

32:46
this is crazy it is the exact opposite they are 
being crazy by not just putting all of this to  

32:53
rest even if her very active and photographed 
teaching years even if she found some throughout  

33:00
her very active in photographed teaching years of 
her and John Michelle together I'd be like okay   cool there is um only one massive family reunion 
photo that I could find since that family photo  

33:14
that was taken in the 1950s in Aman and this photo 
was actually published in 1991 um in a German  

33:23
magazine and I'm going to show it to you now you 
can see on the right there we have got brigit now  

33:32
brigit oier and missing from this photo is Jean 
Michelle there's no Jean Michelle in this photo  

33:40
and it was allegedly them all getting together 
to celebrate the 50th wedding anniversary of the  

33:47
father Jean George trogo and his wife Simone so 
why would you not have all the siblings there that  

33:54
are alive doesn't that seem like quite the event 
to miss just be like a very like we should very  

34:00
easily be able to say that the siblings are all 
here because you don't just miss your parents 50th  

34:06
in 1991 we know that John Michelle has never died 
on paper okay he's never died on paper he is still  

34:15
alive according to brijit mccon but what he does 
what he has been doing what his career is nobody  

34:24
knows nobody knows we are told in one book by one 
journalist who found it to be very suspicious when  

34:31
she went out to investigate this circumstance 
Emanuel anisan that she was told in Aman that  

34:38
he just plays cards with his friends I guess he's 
just a private guy who never left Aman that's what  

34:44
we're supposed to believe he never left Aman after 
his divorce from veronique Drew now he's just kind   of like retired and playing cards in a cafe 
with his friends okay nobody really knows what  

34:55
he's been up to so with question that were then 
reaching a fever pitch amongst the French public  

35:00
when they realized that for whatever reason this 
brother had been sort of left out of Bri story  

35:06
and now they're being told that well him and Brit 
were so close that at his wedding she signed at   his very private wedding to veronique Drew uh she 
signed on as the witness and also at her wedding  

35:18
he was the uh best man people are going what's 
going on here where is this person suddenly the  

35:24
media had to start making up some answers and the 
answer they provided was oh little chubby guy as  

35:31
I discussed with with Xavier pussard we are told 
that this guy is the extraordinarily private Jean  

35:37
Michelle all grown up now I can tell you right 
off the bat in case you're wondering the world  

35:43
economic Forum Chinese software program says no 
that is not the Jean Michelle that we are looking  

35:48
for of a little boy in the photo I can show you 
this match right here the confidence is 54% now  

35:56
Xavier does say that when it it comes to glasses 
just to be super clear with you guys um that the  

36:02
technology doesn't want you to use two people 
that are wearing glasses or glasses in general  

36:07
they do caution can sometimes shade the face in 
a different way but you can see here when we're   showing you this we're talking 52% confidence on 
the little chubby one next to him anyways it would  

36:19
be easier rather than having to use technology 
if the Ellie a palace just came right out and   said yes this is actually Jean Michelle trau 
the one you've been looking for the same one  

36:28
pictured in that 1953 family photo from Aman it's 
such an easy thing to say that's not their thing  

36:35
Clarity is not their thing ease is not their 
thing Hush Hush be quiet threat Sue is their  

36:41
thing so instead just to be clear in the initial 
letter that they sent me the 100 page letter of  

36:50
an opport of an opportunity really to say to me do 
not publish your series I am telling you that this  

36:57
genre Michelle that you're looking for that little 
boy I'm the is alive and well and they could have  

37:02
just provided me photos of his Missing Years 
they decided to squander away that opportunity  

37:08
by instead sending me screenshots of the little 
chubster at the inauguration of Emanuel macron  

37:15
this this is what they sent me this is the exact 
language what's more Jean Michelle has recently  

37:22
appeared in public he attended President macron's 
inauguration in 2017 and 2022 2022 during your  

37:32
June 12th 2024 appearance on Piers Morgan uncenter 
uncentered you bet Piers Morgan $100,000 he could  

37:39
not find a photo of Jean Michelle trau implying 
that this would disprove your false claims below  

37:46
are publicly available images of Jean Michelle 
trau from videos of President macron's 2017 and  

37:53
2022 inauguration you will see that not only is 
Jean Michelle present but also in the same frame  

38:01
as brijit mcon the conclusive evidence that you 
have been seeking to debunk your claims okay so  

38:07
this is amazing keep that up for a second okay 
it's amazing for a lot of reasons it's amazing  

38:13
that the Elis Palace rather than giving us 
a document a passport with things blacked  

38:19
out but maybe just his name a driver's license 
anything that would be a form of ID photos of them  

38:26
together growing up because this is our problem 
is sending me screenshots of an inauguration with  

38:34
a guy in the background aha it's debunked Jean 
Michelle exists like I said 27 of them exists  

38:39
I have no doubt that a jean Michelle trno exists 
somewhere in Amon in fact there's probably 20 of  

38:45
them but of course they mistook me for a fool 
okay I've already been made wise to their game  

38:51
so to speak names and uh it's all about how you 
phrase the questions it means nothing to tell  

38:57
me that a jean Michelle exists but it would mean 
everything if they simply spelled out an answer  

39:04
to a basic question about who they are claiming 
is Jean Michelle so we went back to them with an  

39:10
exact question so as to their so there could have 
been no remaining confusion we were clear we will  

39:16
publish the truth here is the wording that we 
wrote in our letter back because the macron's   dispute the substance of cace's reporting and 
opinions we would like to provide them with the  

39:25
opportunity to present their story and to clear up 
any rumors in the press as such we offer any date  

39:33
and time during the months of January February 
and March of 2025 for an interview between  

39:39
Candace and your clients Candace her producer and 
a videographer will fly to Europe in a range for  

39:45
a translator and studio in which the macron's can 
answer questions as you know the first remedy for  

39:51
a defamation plaintiff is mitigation by using 
available opportunities to contradict the Li  

39:57
or correct the error and thereby to minimize its 
adverse impact on reputation we are providing such  

40:03
an opportunity to facilitate this interview we 
offer the following questions in advance so we  

40:10
gave them this opportunity weeks before we began 
this series to answer a specific question about  

40:16
Jean Michelle at the inauguration and here is 
the question we asked I draw your attention to  

40:21
number three is the man you showed at president 
macron's inauguration inaugurations in 2017 and  

40:30
2022 the same individual pictured on the far left 
in the trogo family photograph from Aman yeah I'm  

40:41
awake to your game okay don't tell me names tell 
me is this the same person and of course you guys  

40:47
we never heard back they had the energy and the 
frustration to write the letter and say it's a   lie and we gave them a Runway of two weeks to say 
just give us a yes or no to this and I promise you  

40:59
okay hand to God on my children's lives if they 
had answered and said yes this is him I would be  

41:04
reporting that information today because I'm not 
interested in jumping down this rabbit hole for   the purpose of spinning a conspiracy theory okay 
there is something very wrong with this family and  

41:14
perhaps the biggest thing that is wrong with this 
family is their refusal to answer basic questions   while pretending that they're being victimized 
by the questions at the exact same time it is  

41:24
bad faith acting plain and simple bad faith acting 
so with no response from them at all suddenly them  

41:34
going mom on answering these very basic yes or 
no questions we decided to instead turn to try  

41:39
to identify the guy with the the inauguration 
footage what is the screenshot they gave us in  

41:45
their notations a YouTube link hours of footage 
from the inauguration and we decided to scrub  

41:51
through it okay Ellie a palace legal team we will 
raise to the challenge and and look through this  

41:58
maybe this there is this familiar Vibe we can pick 
up on first thing that I should note is that in  

42:04
both of these inaugurations the John Michelle is 
not standing with the family for macron's speeches  

42:13
okay not at either Inauguration in the 2017 
inauguration here's a still he is standing with  

42:19
a bunch of priests okay and when you watch the 
footage the M the family is all walking together  

42:27
as they go down the line and say hi to people and 
Lorent that would be Brit's quote unquote daughter  

42:36
speaks to him very briefly they're all saying hi 
it's like you got to kind of walk through and say   hi the family is walking down and he's greeted 
two kisses on the cheek by Emanuel Marron but  

42:47
he's not standing with his family maybe he showed 
up late right maybe he just showed up too late  

42:53
got ushered in okay fine that can't happen twice 
right something that's also interesting is that  

43:00
Jean Claude his alleged big brother who he wasn't 
with standing with or anything was also present  

43:06
on this inauguration day and yet Jean Claude 
at the luncheon which followed this speech was  

43:12
seated at a table with his siblings he was seated 
Jean Claude was seated with bit here is a photo  

43:18
of that luncheon okay not Jean Michelle not the 
person they alleges Jean Michelle for whatever  

43:24
reason he was not seated with his siblings now 
that's in French the bottom it says this was  

43:29
published by the way in 2023 uh interestingly 
enough in Paris match and they were speaking  

43:35
about the trogo family and they declined to 
mention that Jean Michelle as they're telling  

43:41
us now was at this inauguration not sitting down 
at this table with his relatives not sitting down  

43:48
with his brother not sitting down with bit and 
what it says down there is at the table of brigit  

43:53
her brother John Claude and and loved ones okay 
interesting maybe maybe he needed some fresh air  

44:03
who knows maybe he didn't want to sit there maybe 
they've got a strange relationship but let me tell   you it's going to get even stranger at the 2022 
inauguration because scrubbing through the footage  

44:12
I once again recognize that Jean Michelle is not 
standing anywhere near the family for the speech  

44:18
was he late again I don't know my friends I'm 
going to show you this because even more Awkward  

44:23
is the fact that when Emanuel finishes a speech 
and does the walk he goes over to the family  

44:30
section here he is and he makes a concerted effort 
to kiss and hug everyone alongside Brit you'll see  

44:39
Brit just a pace behind him intentionally pausing 
to kiss and hug all the family members you can see  

44:45
them they start leaning in they come out look at 
Mah love you oh take let's take our time here ton  

44:51
looking so proud now he's not walking with anyone 
but brijit um I'm not exactly sure who that guy  

44:58
is but we're what we're seeing here are nephews 
cousins we're able to confirm who all of these   people are this is clearly the family section and 
once again I want to be clear it's both sides of  

45:10
the family that are standing in this section it's 
not just the moon's it is also obviously rit's  

45:16
family and you're going to see that I'm I'm just 
going to let this play because it's important for   you to to recognize the differences here this by 
the way in case you want to look this up yourself  

45:24
is at the 43 minute Mark of the inauguration he 
starts going through his family now you're seeing  

45:30
Lorent another child of Brit okay kissing her 
kids and now behind you have who was supposed  

45:37
to be his mother biological mother Dr Frances 
no who spends her time helping transgendered  

45:44
individuals get new IDs this is the family section 
okay there is no question the person they allege  

45:50
is Jean Michelle for whatever reason once again 
does not want to stand with his family okay  

45:57
you fast forward so that again is the 43 minute 
Mark then you have to fast forward all the way   up to the 51 minute Mark to see him finally 
approaching John Michelle and a couple of things  

46:07
I'm going to point out to you now this is the 
screenshot where the legal team had the audacity   to say in the same frame he's in the same photo as 
his sister Brit what they left out was that Brit  

46:20
completely ignores him I mean completely does not 
say a word to the individual that is supposed to  

46:26
be her brother brother let's watch this together 
and watch how awkward Emanuel mcon is with this

46:31
individual so you are seeing this if you're on 
audio that's her brother that's supposed to be  

46:42
jot and Michelle okay they won't answer that 
for sure but that's supposed to be who they're  

46:48
trying to make us believe is her brother 
nothing said Emanuel Reit just completely  

46:53
oh there's the frame where they're trying to 
like oh she's right there with her brother   says not a word okay you can go back and watch 
this I did not make this up look just walks  

47:01
right by who would do this to their brother on 
inauguration day emanel Mone now I feel like if  

47:06
I was in the presence of my brother-in-law I'd 
like feel like I must go up to him first right I  

47:12
better go up to him first and then emanuel's like 
oh okay I have to say something little friendly   goodbye and that's it okay now let's pause that 
frame who's he standing with let's back up a  

47:22
little bit if you can Mark see that guy in the 
background you want know who he's standing with  

47:27
David Rothchild John Michelle was standing with 
David Rothchild well I'm just I'm I'm truly amazed  

47:35
by this because Jean Michelle didn't have a career 
in baking in banking Johan Michelle may have had  

47:40
a career in baking but not banking right he's 
supposed to be from the family of chocolateers   he's never left Aman we can't find any evidence of 
him having left Aman so what's he doing what's his  

47:50
relation to David Rothschild why is he standing 
there and please just make sense of it again I'm  

47:56
I'm I'm just a regular old person I got nothing 
but Street smarts but I got to tell you my entire  

48:02
family is all the way down there and I've decided 
not to sit with them not to stand with them but to  

48:09
be by myself with security and David Rothchild 
ladies and gentlemen what the hell is going on  

48:19
what's going on do you feel convinced that's 
a family member nope bit once again doesn't   want doesn't want John Michelle at her table they 
were so close when she got married to Andre Lewis  

48:30
she they were so she please I need you to be the 
best man so close when he got married to veronique  

48:37
Drew it must have been a massive family falling 
out that makes it so that even when he's at the   inauguration doesn't want he doesn't stand with 
the family like it just must have been an absolute  

48:48
disaster of a family falling out and again what 
do the Rothchilds have to do with Aman just I  

48:55
just find this to be an incredible theme here so 
what does this all mean what does this all mean  

49:03
well what it means is that unfortunately guys I 
can't answer these questions for you and neither  

49:10
at this moment can Xavier pussard but what it 
means is that for the first time rather than  

49:15
the entire world being told by the mainstream 
media being gaslit by the mainstream media to  

49:20
believe that there was nothing here and canice 
was having postpartum psychosis by looking into  

49:25
the story now millions and millions of people 
worldwide are going to look into the story   Millions have watched this series millions are 
emailing millions are investigating and someone  

49:38
somewhere knows something someone somewhere saw 
something someone somewhere may be able to find  

49:45
a photo of Jean Michelle no in The Archives of 
the medical centers that he worked at throughout  

49:51
his illustrious career someone somewhere maybe 
recognizes which John Michelle that is okay  

50:00
someone somewhere perhaps knows the answer to the 
mystery of what happened to Brit trno where is  

50:11
Brit trno was Brit trno given a different name did 
Brit trno Die Young after having children I don't  

50:20
know the answers to these questions it's taken us 
taken Xavier pussard pardon and people like Nat  

50:27
Ray almost a decade of their lives to get us to 
this point many of them giving up their freedoms  

50:33
Natasha Ray has been in and out with can a cancer 
diagnosis being tortured by the trogo mafia as I  

50:41
would describe it they act like a mafia when you 
start prying into this we will legally abuse you  

50:49
if you start asking these questions because that's 
what we'd rather do than answer anything they have   given up a decade of their lives to researching 
this and now we have the ability to crack this  

51:00
wide open and so if you have information about 
this family maybe you're somebody sitting in  

51:06
Algeria and you're going yeah no I remember 
him yeah what goes on in in Algeria at this  

51:12
time maybe you went to school with Shan Michelle 
trno maybe you are in the French military and you  

51:19
see something strange about access to his files 
because there is a file there is a military file  

51:25
that is being locked down at it pertains to Jean 
Michelle trau again something that is supposed to  

51:31
be made available to the public that they won't 
make available and they just want to Gaslight us   about that he's just so private so private but 
he does go to the inauguration but so private  

51:38
he doesn't want to stand with the family or be 
involved with them he'd rather stand with David  

51:44
dchild help me out guys you have information 
please send it to info Candace ens.com it is  

51:54
my instinct yes I agree with those of you that 
are commenting right now that we are looking  

52:01
potentially at incest that is that is what in my 
gut feels it has to be a secret so big that it  

52:08
would make them react in this way because it is a 
type of violence to treat journalists like this it  

52:14
is a a kind of emotional violence to do these 
sorts of things and they do it as though they  

52:21
know that Vice is nice but incest is best and 
things should be kept within the family family  

52:27

55:12
this person right just got my becoming my becoming 
brigit book in today I can't wait to dive in thank  

55:18
you and your team for all of the great work that 
you guys do honestly guys this series podcast form  

55:23
is one fraction of the work that Xavier pizard 
has done and has put into his book way more pedo  

55:29
criminals that I could have brought up and just 
thought okay we want to keep this series moving   you got to do that deep dive I mean even today me 
telling you about the uncle we hadn't even gotten  

55:37
to that point and um yeah to see the success 
of this book people that are already asking for  

55:43
rights to it in different languages I'm getting 
emails on behalf of e Xavier that are coming in  

55:48
I'm just so happy for him because like I said 
his family what a sacrifice you just don't see   journalists like that anymore who are willing to 
give up and fundamentally alter their their lives  

55:58
to tell a truth and to stand up against true 
power true systemic power and abuse Nadia is  

56:06
giving us tons of vomit emojis just just speaking 
about the topic of incest we are right there with  

56:13
you and it is unbelievable to hear someone just 
say that on stage and admit that freely Ali says  

56:19
canis the media poisoned my mind against you for 
so long I am truly sorry but I am here now and   staying because you are one of the most elegant 
and inspirational people I've ever heard thank  

56:27
you for always speaking truth totally forgiven I 
know so many people have heard lies about me last  

56:33
year when I began looking into the story it seems 
to be one of the points where everything turned  

56:38
around and they just started trying to tell 
people that I was literally Adolf Hitler like   that is the storyline a couple of weeks ago right 
before we started the story they then came out and  

56:47
tried to convince the public that I was inspiring 
school shootings I mean it has been insane insane  

56:52
to see what the media will do to someone when they 
inch closer to a truth and I think all of us wake   up at a different moment and begin to question our 
relationship with the media mine happened a little  

57:01
earlier than yours uh Ali but I had that moment 
too I believed everything that I read because  

57:07
it almost you would be crazy to think that the 
media is actually protecting evil um and attacking  

57:14
good but that is the circumstance that we find 
ourselves in today we recognize that and it's   a beautiful thing to wake up to it actually and 
to have the humility to admit that you are wrong  

57:23
not a lot of people have the humility they just go 
I've said this for years so I have to keep saying   a thing so welcome I'm happy to have you here 
waves just writes you're amazing thank you guys  

57:31
for these compliments I need them today I was so 
tired today like you have these days when you're   pregnant where you're just like I just can't 
do it and I was having that kind of a morning  

57:40
and now I feel great and amazing U Mel writes 
Friday guesses fake moonlanding mant murders  

57:47
fcen okay so I have announced that tomorrow 
I will be announcing my next series and it's  

57:52
a big one we're not going to start it tomorrow 
but I'm going to announce it tomorrow so you're   not going to want to miss Friday's episode and um 
she's guessing moon landing Manson Murders [[Jeffrey Epstein|Epstein]]  

58:04
MLK JFK Obama's birth certificate love you so much 
I love all of those guesses you will have to wait  

58:11
and see Allison just wrote that Allison actually 
just donated to the show so just thank you for  

58:16
that Allison we see that coming through key writes 
hi Candace thanks for your incredible journalism   during the interview Xavier said Mimi had a 
falling out with the fam has no one spoken to  

58:26
her since I feel though Shady that she may have 
the info that we need she is currently um going  

58:32
through trial she's being potentially going to 
be convicted it has a huge Scandal I I remember  

58:37
reading about it vaguely but it involves like 
Nicholas sarosi it's it's insane what she was  

58:43
doing to get blackmail just right up her alley 
you know what I mean and so you can look into   that if you actually just look up nimi marshan 
you can follow that case I don't have an update  

58:52
for you right off the top of uh of my head but 
she is in it and yes of course they would have  

58:57
necessarily had to have distanced themselves as 
they are still pretending that everyone around   them is a criminal it's just not them which is 
pointedly ridiculous Brian writes wow there it  

59:08
is the gene pool is so mixed and Confused in 
both the trogo and mron families that they are  

59:13
difficult to individually identify and yes that 
is the point I believe KH writes macrome was live  

59:20
on Tik Tok earlier all I saw in the comments 
was your name over and over fantastic that is  

59:25
fantastic fantastic I cannot wait to go find that 
he is in a PR crisis uh trying to smile his way  

59:32
through it it's not going to work the Scandal is 
now officially too big and in my opinion Emanuel   macron need to step down from office because you 
have lied repeatedly to the French people you have  

59:41
harassed journalist you are a monster and not a 
monster of your own doing you were targeted when   you were a child and a part of me feels bad for 
you but you are you are are damaged goods and um  

59:51
what you have done is unforgivable as a leader of 
a country what you are doing is unfor forgivable   and no one takes you seriously anymore he's 
actually doing America soon and it's just  

60:00
ridiculous to pretend that he has any power you 
know whatever Shadow is behind you fly it over so  

60:05
they can have a conversation with President 
Trump we know that you were created you are   not real you have no thoughts of your own you are 
The Manchurian Candidate and you have absolutely  

60:16
no power and that's why I didn't fear you when 
you sent a letter because you are an absolute   nobody in my book and what I sense is your fear 
of being seen and what terrifies me is that  

60:27
people described you your own people described 
you as almost Psychopathic during Co like you   were enjoying harming people and I wonder how 
much your childhood being groomed by the person  

60:38
that you are married to impacted that lastly Eddie 
writes I found an interview of brigit talking and  

60:45
it sounds exactly like the mystery trans person in 
your previous video you are batting 1,000 Candice  

60:51
it is not me it is the French people I am blessed 
that Xavier brought this to me and I am blessed  

60:57
that I have the courage to look at something and 
be you know maimed and caricatured and called  

61:02
Crazy by the media and it actually only commits 
me further to that cause because I know what the  

61:07
media is and I I feel grateful I genuinely feel 
honored that this audience has grown that you  

61:12
guys trust me to bring you stories that might 
sound crazy in the beginning trust me tomorrows   is going to sound crazy in the beginning but to 
trust me to then unfold it for you and at our core  

61:23
what all of these stories have in common is that 
you will recognize the media for what it is it is  

61:29
an evil entity that is not protecting the people 
it is the exact opposite it is it is protecting  

61:36
the globalist power structure and um so thank you 
guys for trusting me with that obviously we will  

61:42
be here tomorrow please head to canis ens.com and 
support our independence and we'll see you then
