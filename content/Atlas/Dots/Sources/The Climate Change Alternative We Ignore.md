## Summary

Published on February 16, 2020, and updated on February 1, 2025, this blog by The Ethical Skeptic proposes the Exothermic Core-Mantle Decoupling â€“ Dzhanibekov Oscillation Theory (ECDO Theory) as an alternative explanation for recent climate change. The theory suggests that structural and exothermic phase changes in the Earth's nickel-iron core, rather than solely anthropogenic factors, are significant drivers of observed climate phenomena. The author argues that mainstream climate science overlooks critical geophysical dynamics, relying on oversimplified models and political narratives, which risks misguiding climate solutions.

## Core Hypothesis (ECDO Theory): 

The ECDO Theory posits that climate change is significantly influenced by exothermic processes in the Earthâ€™s core, where latent kinetic energy is released during phase transitions of iron from a high-latent-energy hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure to a liquid face-centered cubic (FCC/BCC) form. This heat propagates through the mantle to the [[Asthenosphere]] and abyssal ocean depths, driving climate changes, greenhouse gas emissions, and geomagnetic phenomena. The theory is built on ten observations, supported by data and studies, which collectively challenge the conventional atmospheric carbon-driven climate model.

## Key Observations and Arguments:

1.  Winter CO2 Pause and Vernal Jump (Observation 1):
    - Northern Hemisphere CO2 levels show a winter pause (Dec 15â€“Jan 15) despite increased human activity, suggesting a natural, solar-driven process tied to permafrost and tundra heating. The vernal jump (Feb 15â€“Apr 1) in CO2 emissions correlates with solar latitude, not human activity, and was evident during the 2020 COVID-19 industrial shutdown, which saw a record CO2 increase despite reduced emissions (Exhibit 1C). ![[Lockdown-Resulted-in-Largest-PPM-Surge-in-45-Years.webp]]**Exhibit 1C**Â â€“ 2019/2020 carbon ppm as compared to select 5-year annual variation profiles. 2020 record carbon ppm increase occurred simultaneous with a 47% shutdown of the global economy. This is a white crow falsification event.

2. CO2 Following Temperature (Observation 2):
    - Global temperature increases lead CO2 rises, not vice versa, with CO2 levels accelerating non-linearly while human activity remains linear. This suggests a natural driver, as economic slowdowns (e.g., 2008â€“2012) did not reduce CO2 trends (Exhibit 2A).![[Global-CO2-and-Temperature-Increase-thru-2022-1.webp]]**Exhibit 2A**Â â€“ CO2Â levels are chasing temperatures by means of an unjustifiable acceleration function, which must be regression-adjusted every year to maintain the relationship. Is it possible that, rather than pulling linear temperatures up, this curve is being pushed (accelerated) by them instead?

3. Albedo Discrepancy (Observation 3):
    - Earthâ€™s re-emergent albedo, measured by Ceres EBAF, is higher than expected, indicating that atmospheric CO2 is not capturing as much heat as models predict, necessitating alternative heat sources (Exhibit 3A).![[Albedo-is-Not-Reducing-as-it-Should.webp]]**Exhibit 3A**Â â€“ Extract from Nikolov-Zeller albedo study.

4. Sea Level and Ocean Current Changes (Observation 4):
    - Mean sea level (MSL) variance has increased by 25% over five decades, correlating with a 15% rise in global ocean current speeds, which cannot be explained by atmospheric winds alone. This suggests a geothermal energy source (Exhibits 4A, 4B). ![[Both-Charts-Combined.webp]]**Exhibit 4A**Â â€“ Four NOAA stations show sea level increases; however, also show that mean sea level range is also increasing. The 25% increase in MSL Range indicates that ocean currents have sped up 15% since 1973. This requires a substantially larger amount of energy than climate models can attribute to Earthâ€™s atmosphere alone. ![[Pulse-Band-to-Ocean-Current-Speed-and-Variation-of-Monthly-Mean-Sea-Leve-by-sovrynn-3.webp]]**Exhibit 4B**Â â€“ While the cycling of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) can be misused to rationalize potential energy heat releases, it cannot obscure mechanical energy (kinetics) in the same manner. The spike in kinetics (both its abrupt arrival and subsequent abatement), shown in the top panel of the chart above, corresponds directly to the heat pulse arrivals in the bottom panel. This energy input must originate from outside the ocean itselfâ€”and categorically cannot be attributed to solar Total Solar Irradiance (TSI). This is a deductive, robust, and critically overlooked aspect of climate science. 

5. Schumann Resonance and Geomagnetic Shifts (Observation 5):
    - Increased Schumann Resonance amplitude and a weakening, wandering geomagnetic north pole correlate with temperature rises, indicating core dynamics influencing climate (Exhibits 5A, 5B).![[diagram_spectrogram_ciontinous_pulsations_schumann3.webp]]**Exhibit 5A**Â â€“ Higher range of Schumann Resonance bands typical of the last few decades.![[geomagnetic-pole-movement-with-chart-2.webp]] **Exhibit 5B**Â â€“ Acceleration and weakening of geomagnetic North Pole comes commensurate with global temperature increases. This is not a mere â€˜correlationâ€™, and bears direct mechanism.

6. Earthâ€™s Rotation Speed-Up (Observation 6):
    - The Earthâ€™s rotation has accelerated since 1972, suggesting a decoupling of the outer core and mantle due to mass transfer, accompanied by heat plumes that slow rotation periodically (Exhibits 6A, 6B, 6C).![[day-length-history.webp]] **Exhibit 6A**Â â€“ Daily Deviation from SI Day â€“ Annual time (leap seconds) added by year. Red line shows the timing of leap second additions, approximately 3 to 4 times faster than throughout Earthâ€™s history on average. However, please note the change in this trajectory starting in 1972Â which coincides with an extended warming period since that time. ![[day-length-history-versus-temps-1.webp]] **Exhibit 6B**Â â€“ Progressing from an extended period of leap seconds to now, skip seconds. Open Ocean temperature progressions move in sync with changes in the speed of the Earthâ€™s rotation. Notice how the punctuated temperature increases are plume-like and sudden, occurring in one single year for the most part in concert with a reversal-slowing of Earthâ€™s rotation. This is mechanical, and not ambient in the least. Overall however, we observe a decoupling of the Earthâ€™s outer core and mantle, which coincides with a warming period (Mackey decadal warming â€“ exothermic outer core). ![[Rotating-and-Static.webp]]**Exhibit 6C**Â â€“Â **Flaming Mountain Cast into the Sea**Â â€“ Ultralow Velocity Zone (ULVZ) and Large Low-Velocity Province (LLVP) upwelled structures (core â€˜sloughing mountainsâ€™) produce ice skater effect. Mass moves from core to mantle and slows Earthâ€™s outer body rotation. Non-LLVP and Non-ULVZ regions (Pacific Rim, South America, and Antarctica) release latent heat of entailed Fe phase change from HCP to FCC/BCC.

7. 2023 Heat Plume (Observation 7):
    - A 2023 ocean sea surface temperature (SST) surge, contributing 48% of global SST heat gain since 1995 in just 3â€“4 weeks, preceded CO2 rises and coincided with Antarctic ice melt and Canadian wildfires. This rapid, non-atmospheric heating supports a geothermal source (Exhibits 7A, 7B, 7C, 7D). ![[March-jump-in-temps-precedes-CO2-by-a-month-ppt-1.webp]] **Exhibit 7A â€“ El Cuervo Blanco**Â **Falsifying Observation**Â â€“ The Spring 2023 Ocean SST Heat Plume Precedes Associated CO2Â Release â€“ This heat plume eventuallyÂ [composed 48%](https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/July-2023-SST-Warming-Global.png)Â (73% in the north Atlantic) of the entire SST heat gain since 1995, in a mere 3 weeks. There is only one kinetic source which can impart such an improbable rush of kinetic energy into the oceans, off season, without heating the atmosphere by 20 additional degrees (which did not occur). This heat plume was above and beyond the normal seasonal peak ocean warming from the solar crossing of the equator upon the northern hemisphereâ€™s vernal equinox. That kinetic source is the Earthâ€™s exothermic core.[65](chrome-extension://ecabifbgmdmgdllomnfinbmaellmclnh/data/reader/template.html#easy-footnote-bottom-65-43393)Â As well, of critical note is the fact that this temperature surge preceded the associated CO2Â surge by a full month.Â **_Moreover, notice that the Keeling Curve CO2Â peak actually DECLINED from 2022 to 2023, while the only non-cyclic increase in CO2Â for the entire period, occurred during this 3 week heat surge â€“ a full 50% of the annual Keeling Curve Differential._**Â This is a falsifying observation. ![[Canadian-Wildfires3.webp]]**Exhibit 7B**Â â€“ 2023 Canadian wildfires erupted out of season â€“ nonetheless were a historic record â€“ commensurate with the 2023 north Atlantic SST heat plume and its subsequent July 2-meter air temperature 3-day surge.[67](chrome-extension://ecabifbgmdmgdllomnfinbmaellmclnh/data/reader/template.html#easy-footnote-bottom-67-43393) ![[Sea-Ice-Extent-July-2023-2.webp]] **Exhibit 7C â€“ Antarctic Sea Ice Extent Deviation by Day-of-Year Mean (not â€˜Daily Meanâ€™) Winter 2023**Â â€“ this sudden dynamic drop in sea ice extent, which emerged commensurate with the sudden peak in 2 meter and SST global temperatures, could not possibly have been caused by the atmosphere. This melt-off not only arrived during the winter, but during a 6-year-record-cold winter (2m Air Temp 25 Jul 2023 = -80Â°F (-62.2Â°C) and the 800 mile envelope surrounding the continent in every direction was well below freezing)[72](chrome-extension://ecabifbgmdmgdllomnfinbmaellmclnh/data/reader/template.html#easy-footnote-bottom-72-43393)Â (source, without â€˜winterâ€™ and â€˜6-year Record Low Tempsâ€™ annotations: Eliot Jacobsen, @eliotjacobsen Twitter; 24 July 2023) ![[Geothermal-Pulse-Banding.webp]] **Exhibit 7D â€“ Current 15-year Heat Pulse Cycle**Â â€“ the regular cyclic arrivals in Sea Surface Temperature (SST) geothermal heat emanate from natural Earth-core processes, much like the sun cycles in its regular Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) Schwabe Cycle every 11 years.[73](chrome-extension://ecabifbgmdmgdllomnfinbmaellmclnh/data/reader/template.html#easy-footnote-bottom-73-43393)Â Each geothermal heat pulse arrival is followed by a subsequent period of regression in climate heat (see down arrows) until the next 15-year cycle arrives.

8. Increased Seismic and Volcanic Activity (Observation 8):
    - Rising deep earthquakes and volcanic activity correlate with temperature increases, suggesting upper mantle activity as a climate driver (Exhibit 8A). ![[volcanism-on-Earth.webp]] **Exhibit 8A**Â â€“ Recent rise in global eruptions, matches rise in active volcanoes.

9. Cohesive Heat Anomalies (Observation 9):
    - Heat anomalies originate at the Mid-Atlantic Rise and follow consistent, non-ambient patterns, driven by thermohaline currents and El NiÃ±o/La NiÃ±a cycles, which account for 85% of SST changes over 41 years (Exhibits 9A, 9B, 9C, 9D). ![[Anomaly-Dynamic-2.webp]] **Exhibit 9A**Â â€“ Global heat waves form two consistent patterns, which are differentiated by latitude and flow in the same direction each cycle. This is mechanical, not ambient. ![[Thermohaline-Conveyance-Map.webp]] **Exhibit 9B**Â â€“ Thermohaline currents play the central role in distribution of abyssal and polar ocean heat (or reduced cooling) to the Earthâ€™s atmosphere. ![[March-2022-Antarctica.webp]]**Exhibit 9** Â â€“ _This observed Antarctic heat plume is not ambient, chemical, greenhouse, nor convection, radiation, or conduction._Â _This is mechanical â€“ mantle-derived conveyance and cannot possibly be any other mechanism._ ![[El-Nino-La-Nina-Timing-with-Global-Temps.webp]] **Exhibit 9D**Â â€“ El NiÃ±o (red) and La NiÃ±a (blue) effects demonstrated inside global temperature increases. Mechanically, not ambiently driven.

10. Abyssal Ocean Heating (Observation 10):
    - Abyssal oceans (4000â€“6000 m) show significant heat content (71% of surface layer heat), inconsistent with atmospheric heating but consistent with geothermal flux from tectonic ridges and hotspots. Recent Argo float data (2023â€“2024) confirm unexpected abyssal warming (Exhibits 10A, 10B, 10C, 10D, 10E, 10F). ![[The Climate Change Alternative We Ignore.png]] **Exhibit 10A**Â â€“ Climate science does not have a counter argument to the Exothermic Core Theory because it does not examine the data necessary to falsify it, nor expose its own theory to accountability. This constitutes a fatal exclusion bias. ![[surface-deep-and-abyssal-heat-delta-T-93-2017-2-10.webp]] **Exhibit 10B**Â **â€“ Conservative Scenario**Â â€“ The cited Desbruyeres study identifies a large series of â€˜warmâ€™ deep and abyssal ocean layers. A conservative scenario (25 zJoules) is depicted in column 3, which allocates tapered heat content of 184 and 25 zettajoules according to the NOAA Chart on the right hand side and according to Exhibit 10D extracted from the cited Desbruyeres study. This distribution is then normalized for a theoretical single 5000 m ocean depth in column 5. A full 71% of the surface layer heat, exists as a distributed heat content anomaly along the depth of ocean which communicates with the sea floor globally. This phenomenon is ignored by climate science. One must also consider that, unlike the surface layers, this heat is constantly and quickly removed to the surface by advection and upwelling currents. ![[Thermal-Anomaly-Delta-T-conveyance-to-surface-annotated-15.webp]] **Exhibit 10C**Â â€“ This large swath of â€˜warmâ€™ layering (normalized to a single depth, 4750 â€“ 5000 m in gJ/m3) inside mostly abyssal ocean depths then conveys (advection through abyssal currents) and upwells this heat content to the polar ocean surface first, skipping around the deep ocean depths, and heating (or failing to cool as well as it once did) Earthâ€™s atmosphere. Remember, the surface layer is the heat sink in this system â€“ the deep and abyssal layers are not. ![[Global-Ocean 1.webp]] **Exhibit 10D**Â â€“ heat content changesÂ _(dÎ¸_/_dt_) by deep and abyssal layer, per Desbruyeres, Purkey, et al. ![[First-Argo-Abyssal-Oceanic-Returns.webp]]

While multiple variables and assumptions inform this modelâ€”including a conservative 2.1-cycle advection of warmed oceanic volume near geothermal hotspots, and an average current speed of 1.67 km/hâ€”all parameters remain well within reasonable bounds. The resulting 6.34 Ã— 10Â²Â² joules of additional thermal energy readily accounts for the observed 2023 sea surface temperature surge shown in Exhibit 7D. 

## Mechanistic Framework:

- Core Phase Transition: The Earthâ€™s core sloughs HCP iron, releasing latent heat during its transition to FCC/BCC iron, weakening the magnetic field and speeding up rotation (Exhibit C).
- Heat Transfer: This heat reaches the asthenosphere via magnetocaloric effects and conduction, heating deep ocean currents, methane hydrates, and oil formations, which release greenhouse gases (Exhibit B).
- Ocean Conveyance: Abyssal currents convey this heat to the surface, reducing cooling efficiency and driving SST increases, polar ice melt, and atmospheric warming (Exhibit A).
- Cyclic Nature: The process is cyclic, potentially reversing when the core re-accretes HCP iron, which could lead to rapid cooling.

## Critique of Mainstream Climate Science:

- The author criticizes climate science for relying on static, oversimplified models (e.g., watts/mÂ² budgets) that ignore dynamic, geothermal contributions and assume atmospheric dominance without sufficient abyssal data.
- The failure to predict the 2023 heat plume and reliance on ad hoc explanations (e.g., AABW for abyssal warming) indicate a pseudoscientific approach, marked by a Kuhnian incommensurability between measured solar flux and poorly understood geothermal flux (Exhibit 11).
- The dismissal of alternative hypotheses and political enforcement of a single narrative (anthropogenic CO2) hinder scientific progress.

## Implications and Call to Action:

- The ECDO Theory does not negate anthropogenic contributions but argues that geothermal processes, alongside human activity (notably Chinaâ€™s emissions), are major climate drivers.
- Ignoring this risks misdirected policies and unpreparedness for potential rapid cooling if the core cycle reverses.
- The author advocates for rigorous, unbiased research into abyssal ocean dynamics and geothermal flux to refine climate models and address the crisis effectively.

## Conclusion: 

The blog presents a compelling, data-driven case for the ECDO Theory, supported by extensive observations and studies, challenging the dominant anthropogenic climate narrative. It calls for a pluralistic approach under Ockhamâ€™s Razor, urging science to investigate core-driven climate dynamics to avoid catastrophic missteps in addressing global warming.
