## Summary

[[Jack Kruse, MD|Kruse]], a neurosurgeon and health educator, argues that modern environments—characterized by artificial light, [[Non-Native Electromagnetic Fields]] (EMFs), and processed foods—disrupt the body’s quantum processes, leading to chronic diseases like obesity, diabetes, and infertility. He proposes aligning with natural environmental inputs (light, water, magnetism) to restore mitochondrial function and achieve optimal health. The discussion likely covers [[Dr. Jack Kruse|Kruse]]’s core protocols, such as the Leptin Prescription, [[Cold thermogenesis]], and the Epi-Paleo diet, emphasizing their role in leveraging quantum mechanics for cellular health. The podcast aligns with Kruse’s broader philosophy, as outlined in his blog (jackkruse.com) and X posts, challenging conventional medicine’s biochemical focus with a decentralized, nature-based approach.

### Key Concepts Discussed

1. [[Quantum Biology]] as a Health Framework (00:00:00–00:05:40, Intro; 00:05:40, Evolutionary Mysteries):
    
    - Kruse introduces [[Quantum Biology]], explaining how quantum phenomena (e.g., electron tunneling, coherence) govern biological processes like mitochondrial energy production. He posits that mitochondria act as quantum [[Semiconductors]], using sunlight to drive electron transport and cellular signaling.
    - Modern lifestyles disrupt these processes through artificial light (blue light from screens) and EMFs, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and diseases. This aligns with his “Mitochondriac Credo,” where health depends on optimizing environmental inputs.
        
2. Light and Circadian Rhythms (00:25:41, DHA & Leptin Pathways; 00:30:48, Mitochondrial Protection):
    
    - Sunlight, particularly UV and infrared wavelengths, is the primary driver of health, regulating circadian rhythms, melatonin, and leptin pathways via [[Melanopsin]] in the retina and skin. [[Dr. Jack Kruse|Kruse]] emphasizes morning sunlight exposure (20–30 minutes) to reset circadian clocks and enhance leptin sensitivity.
    - Blue light toxicity from screens disrupts melatonin and cortisol, impairing mitochondrial redox potential and contributing to metabolic disorders. He recommends blue-blocking glasses and red lighting at night.
        
3. Leptin Resistance and the Leptin Prescription (00:25:41, DHA & Leptin Pathways):
    
    - Leptin resistance, where the brain fails to respond to the satiety hormone leptin, is a root cause of obesity and chronic disease. Kruse links it to environmental mismatches, like blue light exposure and circadian disruption.
        
    - His Leptin Prescription includes:
        - High-protein, high-fat breakfast (50–75g protein) within 30 minutes of waking to stabilize cortisol and align circadian rhythms.
        - Minimal snacking and carb timing at night to reduce insulin spikes.
        - Avoiding late eating to support melatonin release.
        - Evening exercise (HIIT or weights) to avoid cortisol-driven fat storage.
            
    - These steps aim to restore leptin sensitivity, supported by studies showing protein stabilizes blood sugar and circadian alignment improves metabolic markers.
        
4. [[Cold thermogenesis]] (CT) (00:30:48, Mitochondrial Protection):
    
    - Cold exposure (e.g., cold showers, ice baths at 50–60°F) activates brown adipose tissue, boosts mitochondrial efficiency, and reduces inflammation by upregulating uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). [[Dr. Jack Kruse|Kruse]] recommends morning CT to align with cortisol peaks, synergizing with sunlight exposure.
    - Case studies from his blog suggest CT reverses insulin resistance and enhances fat burning, aligning with scientific evidence on cold-induced metabolic benefits.
        
5. Epi-Paleo Diet and DHA (00:25:41, DHA & Leptin Pathways):
    
    - Kruse’s Epi-Paleo diet prioritizes high-fat, moderate-protein, low-carb foods (e.g., fatty fish, organ meats) rich in DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), critical for cell membrane signaling and leptin pathways. Eating in natural light enhances metabolic signaling.
    - He advocates pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) supplements (10–20 mg daily) to support mitochondrial biogenesis, especially during weight loss.
        
6. Great Oxygenation Event and Evolutionary Biology (00:10:07, Great Oxygenation Event; 00:15:33, Oxygen & Metabolism):
    
    - Kruse ties human evolution to the Great Oxygenation Event (2.4 billion years ago), which increased atmospheric oxygen, enabling mitochondria to harness sunlight for energy. This underscores his view that modern humans must align with natural light and oxygen-driven metabolism to thrive.
    - UV light enhances nitric oxide production, improving blood flow, while DHA in cell membranes supports quantum signaling.
        
7. Redox Potential and Bioelectrics (00:30:48, Mitochondrial Protection):
    
    - Redox potential, the cell’s ability to transfer electrons, reflects mitochondrial health. [[Dr. Jack Kruse|Kruse]] cites [[Robert O Becker]]’s bioelectric research, showing that electric fields from mitochondria influence cell morphology and regeneration, disrupted by EMFs.
    - Protocols like grounding (barefoot contact with Earth’s magnetic field) and avoiding Wi-Fi/5G enhance redox potential, supporting health.
        
8. Decentralized Medicine:
    
    - Kruse critiques centralized medicine for focusing on symptoms (e.g., drugs) rather than root causes (environment). His decentralized approach empowers individuals to use nature’s tools—sunlight, cold, diet—for health optimization, as practiced at his Kruse Longevity Center.

## Transcript:

00:00:00	I need you to stop focusing in on your I can'ts I need you to start focusing on your I I don't think I've said the word I can't once this entire conversation what is God effectively telling us that the answer is ultimately found in light but guess what God didn't tell us they centralize and control scientific narrative through centralization and control of the money the Rockefeller people absorb the story of RNA and DNA link it to drugs voila you have centralized medicine the thing in front of you right now yeah that

00:00:30	Apple computer that changes the light that you're adapted to and that destroys Palm SE signaling in us and leads to all the chronic diseases that we have today Francis Bacon says nature to be commanded must be obeyed it's a Quantum Nano engine that works with 100% efficiency there's no loss to friction no l we've never built an engine ever like the atpa do you want to hear the the worst part that we haven't talked about yet do you know who owns that system Robert Maxwell and Gain Maxwell how's that you didn't think [[Jeffrey Epstein|Epstein]] was

00:01:04	going to come into this environment Go [Music] on I think our environment and our families our experiences train us like I believe there's Alphas betas gamas deltas and thetas and the thing is there's times when like I've said to Shantel I'm low energy but even in my low energy State I can elevate it if we're talking about something that I'm very interested in dude I will bring you to the tip of the spear and make you understand that this is important and we do it in the words we use the inflection the

00:01:54	tones um it's we're not just powerful in how we speak the words we use but how we deliver and when you're in someone's physical presence that is the most powerful state that you're going to have with another person like when you're talking to them over the phone um you know you probably had news break where you say yeah let's not talk about this on the phone let's let's let's go meet have a coffee and yeah let's chat about this like if it's one of your buddies breaking up with his girlfriend or you know something else or

00:02:30	like if your kid you know just flunk a test and come talk to me yeah you know what I'm saying yeah and but the the other thing is too when you're at a meeting like I just went through the the adopting [[Bitcoin]] meeting and I sat there and I thought to myself the room is incredible the speakers were horrible we have to elevate this game now re I realize that this is a new conference and what am I saying some people would hear if you're the p IST oh the conference sucked no no that's not what I'm saying the conference was

00:03:04	really good but we need to put better a carbon based substrate on the stage to actually have more interesting conversations because guess what's going to happen when guys like you come to Al Salvador you're going to say wow I feel like the power yeah of this room and the message that's being delivered it turns out the message that's being delivered in a podcast in a discussion with your friends to me that's the that's the where the the Mana comes from well I'm so happy to be in the Mana with you

00:03:35	today um I think we have to start you know Quantum biology day if we could put a a frame on the whole conversation we're going to have today you may want to change that frame but you've said in the past that there's light water and magnetism is like the three-legged stool of quantum biology and so I want to ask you about each of these like defining them what they are really unpacking them from an elementary principles approach and so to do that I want to I'll start with a quote about light this is from you you

00:04:07	said life organizes around light and light is the biggest part of the three-legged stool of light water and magnetism so how about we start with the story of light what is light and how is it so relevant to us light contains all the energy and information that's present in the world and it's buried and it's hidden from us and matter has to be used to pull that energy and information out what's the next semiconductor that does that water water is the means of communication for us to understand the

00:04:46	energy and information that's buried in light so remember how this all began whether you're religious or you believe in the theory of evolution what did they say in Genesis 111 to 1112 let there be light mhm so what is God effectively telling yeah what is God effectively telling us that the answer is ultimately found in light but guess what God didn't tell us what the recipe was so what's the message to you and me as sened beings that are having this discussion that we need to parse out how we get and tap the information

00:05:24	and energy and information that's in light so that we can make a meaningful life that we can explain Bitcoin that we can explain why we're drawn to each other why we don't like each other you know why Arabs and Jews don't like each other why you know the United States government is filled with criminals the answer is in the light that's around us and it's our duty to decipher it and inside our Cranium we have this amazing Quantum electromagnetic computer that allows us to decipher the cipher in the code of

00:06:05	light so the other quot the quote on Water I was going to quote of you you said water is a chameleon it's the medium the means and the message for cells and so you have life occurring at the interface point between light and water um what and I've also heard you say that light structures water uh this struck me it sounded to me like almost like a masculine and feminine principle look at dos that the Sun the the energy the the information the the structuring bringing order to chaos and water is more the chaotic fluid generative like

00:06:46	Dynamic um aspect of I don't think about it as male and female but when I say structure what what am I fundamentally talking about I'm talking about the physics I'm talking about water is physically changed it's a phase transition mhm when light interacts with it okay now I understand how you could say that would be a male and female interaction because I do get that because obviously there is a change masculine feminine is more like the assertive and receptive aspects of reality I'm talking about a little bit

00:07:17	more Eastern philosophy female but yes I when I tend to talk about this stuff I get very very reductionist when I'm trying to describe it to a non-scientific audience so when I say structure the atomic structure of water is physically Changed by light right in other words water no longer is H2O got it it actually changes its crystalline structure it becomes a liquid crystallin display that allows life on Earth to manifest in the way that it does uh and that's what gives us you know the library of auam

00:08:00	of human kind our brains are designed to decipher that message in a very specific way because of how we use the electromagnetic spectrum we don't use the entire electromagnetic spectrum on Earth We're designed to use a very small part of it in fact one octave of 73 octaves that are present so if you think about light in the grander scale the electromagnet itic spectrum is a scale that has 73 octaves but on our planet where we are Third Rock From the Sun we use one Octan and we do something very unusual most of it is in the

00:08:44	visible spectrum between 250 and 760 we can go all the way up to 3100 but we also use 7.83 Hertz which is in the extreme low frequency radio weight and that actually is the frequency of the T TV station that's built into our brains that allow us to know where the Sun and the Earth are in relation to each other why because it turns out that seasonal changes are big that also means circadian changes are big just as you experienced today come to El Salvador the sun rises at you know 6:04 a.m. today um our brains are designed to pay

00:09:25	attention to that because it turns out every single biochemical pathway in US takes its lead from when that sun rises and what happens at 7 what happens at 8 there's sequential changes these are US changing the equalizer buttons on the flow meters of entropy which are our mitochondria that actually tell us what time is doing that allows us to extract the energy and the information from the light that's around us at every time and the amount of energy and information that we can extract from light actually is a consequence of the

00:10:06	time that's around us can we extract the same amount of information in the morning that we can at noon the answer is science actually tells us to centralize science that our cognition is best at midday so if you think about that I made the case to you that our capabilities are not great not as great as they could be we're not designed in the decentralized network of nature to be at our best in the morning or at night cognitively we are sharp we are the the silly talking monkey with a quantum computer on our head that works

00:10:43	best at midday when the best light of the day is around us so that should actually tell you why I always believe that food trumps I should say light trumps food because we know that the best light of the day is when our cognition is tremendous but it points out something that you asked me about um do we Harvest light energy and light information the same at all hours of the day the answer is no we don't and we need to become aware of that because it turns out what happens when we use a competing light

00:11:21	source or information source that means we're not able to extract the full amount of energy or information from those systems either so the sun obviously giving us light that powers the water-based organism that we are we are we are you said a Quantum battery of some kind that's basically power running on sunlight well the other part of the story we haven't got to yet question for me is you said basically light is creating this crystalline structure in water correct light's crystallizing water what is it about water

00:11:59	specifically that gives it this unique ability to have such an interactive relationship with light oh it's the two atoms on the periodic table that make it interesting uh oxygen is the second most electr negative atom on the periodic table hydrogen is the simplest atom the hydrogen that we favor uh in life is actually light hydrogen that's called dyum prodium prodium is is the weakest or I should say the the proton uh dyum is a proton and a neutron so it has double the atomic weight but it's still

00:12:33	called hydrogen the third one which we don't use is tridium tridium is two neutrons and one proton it's it is um radioactive it has no use in biology but it's present on Earth so those are the three Isotopes so most people their relationship with water is H2 out out of the top you have to realize H2 of the top also is different when you live in Miami elava or Copenhagen it has its own ZIP code why because that's tied to the hydrology cycle of the earth so it turns out the least amount of dyum is in our water at

00:13:10	the poles the highest amount of dyum is at the uh equator what's the reason for that the decentralized network of nature actually tells you that where water has to be the strongest meaning carry the most energy dyum has to be absent that's because the sun is weak in those those areas where the sun is the strongest water can be the weakest so in other words this is like the face of Janice when you think about mythology that there's always got to be a good and bad and I think you talking about how

00:13:41	advantageous it is to live near the equator yesterday sorry previously and now you're saying there's a problem too well yeah there is but the problem is is this as we age our heteroplasmic rate meaning the entropy in our system goes up that's what age effectively is Doug Wallace from the Children's Hospital Philadelphia has figured out on average normal aging we go up 10% every year in terms of losing on thermodynamic efficiency so that's what normal aging is a consequence of yeah but what doug

00:14:14	doesn't do a good job telling people is that aging can speed up or slow down within that decade in other words we can age like for example you shared with with me yesterday your gut has been a problem for you your whole life so that means the gut clocks in nine years not a whole life yeah yeah the the gut clocks in you have aged at a faster rate than say the gut clocks I should say the clocks in your skin or the clocks in your eyes so the consequent is that you have to realize that even the clocks and

00:14:41	you have a different zip code and certain things can affect them but we don't have this experience because centralized medicine doesn't teach us this but the physics of organisms does and it comes down to understanding that light Powers water and then from that consequence then we get the ordering of matter how does the ordering of matter begin that's the story of where DNA and RNA comes from why because they're electromagnetic antennas okay that's my next question is electromagnetism so electromagnetism

00:15:18	includes light I think yes but it also goes beyond light I guess in some ways the way the way I would like you to think about it like for this podcast and you were saying electromagnetism is like the alphabet so please tell me what that means yeah well if you think about the electromagnetic spectrum it has 73 octaves so that means it goes from low end which is RF which is radio frequency up to uh gamma rays gamma rays being the strongest ones things that are released from Stars uh we have gamma rays here like when

00:15:55	lightning hits the ground if you had the appropriate equipment you could that gamma rays are actually released from lightning bolts just in very small amounts but that's the strongest part of light RF is the weakest part matter is affected by each Octave of the electromagnetic spectrum differently and it turns out on Earth We're most interested in the visible part of the Spectrum which is a very small part and the RF range in 7.83 hertz that's called the sh human resonance that resonance happens because

00:16:33	of the planet and the solar wind in terms of how they interact it creates a resonance in the ionosphere of 7.83 Hertz the interesting part of this is each part of the electromagnetic spectrum should be thought of then as a letter in the alphabet A through Z so if I was to tell you that we're using J and a a would be 7.83 Herz J being the visible Spectrum from 250 to to 760 everything in life can be explained by the extraction of the energy and information from those parts of the spectrum there's nothing on Earth that

00:17:13	cannot be explained by those versions of light and that perspective is decidedly different than what centralized medicine would say so is electromagnetism something like the actual Cosmic software code then if it's alphabetical I think it's a a a way to think about it some people who are hearing this who are probably more spiritual and more religious would think Jack are you saying that God is light and light is God in that way I would be okay with that analogy but to remember you have to Cipher or decipher the

00:17:47	cipher inside of light and what I'm telling you is that the environment builds in that radio system in other words you have to have a way to extract the energy information from the system and effectively that's what Robert breed love and Jack Cruz are we extract yeah energy and information from that system but even amongst us you and I may be like considered like an AM radio station you may be 760 I'm 1380 we can be brothers maybe not even identical could be resident correct but disimilar correct and that's the experience that

00:18:26	we have with people in our environment that's why when we talked you know earlier this morning about Ai and I told you my problem with AI is that AI doesn't have a Target and I mentioned to you that AI the target of AI in humanity is our children this part of you as the father and part of you is the mother but the child even though it's part mom and po part Dad it's actually a new Ai and other words it's Target wouldn't that be an ni it's like a natural intelligence yeah I mean you could call it that but

00:19:02	it again all it this is is semantics that we use to turn it's a deep philosophical question that where the line between artificial and natural actually exist it's kind of like what we talked about between uh ignorance and and fraud yeah it's exactly the same story it's a sliding scale knowledge and intentionality right and where where's the dividing line and I think you know the discussion we're having today about science is we're really trying to parse out the difference between centralized and decentralized Science and the basis

00:19:33	of the three-level uh three-legged stool lightwater magnetism where it begins where did that idea come from that idea came from and I took it specifically because of Becker's work um because that's what seti uses to look for intelligent life in the masses so if NASA knows that light water and magnetism is the key you know if we're looking at different planets like we can look at Mars Saturn or let's even take it further let's go to the nearest galaxy like Andromeda I I mentioned to one of your guys that's shooting with us

00:20:07	that we could actually be standing in a foreign Galaxy and look at a living life form and not even realize it's alive why because it doesn't use carbon it doesn't use water it doesn't use light the same way we do it's extracting energy from the system and I don't think that this is um I don't think this is a foreign concept why because on our own planet we know 3.8 billion years ago the first two uh domains of life were ARA and bacteria well we know today that AR and bacteria are alive they still exist on the planet

00:20:42	today but they're very different than our family which is ukar Nots which is a combination of those two and the thing is if we didn't have the ability to cognate or res or reason we may not even look at a group of ecoli and say this is alive but the crazy thing is when you know say you take a a deep water marine sub and you go to the bottom of the ocean you see these weird creatures down there and you're like God this is like alien life even on our own Planet the point that I'm trying to make to you the

00:21:18	fractal is I believe the same thing happens on on different life forms I believe that we've already seen other life forms in other places and didn't know it was alive the farm at okioki is a revolutionary new regenerative agricultural Community it features an 8,000 tree Olive Orchard which they use to make their own olive oil as well as a very large pecan orchard all the animals on the farm are Heritage animals with some varieties over 100 years old and others thousands of years old fresh eggs are produced

00:21:51	daily by the Farm's chickens also there are over 1,000 beehives that pollinate the over 200 heirloom fruits and vegetables and provide honey to all the residents the farm makes its own molasses unrefined sugar herbs and spices the farm also features an herbal Apothecary and a commercial kitchen these are just a few reasons why the farm is the healthiest place on Earth to learn more about the healthiest place on Earth go to o.com and use discount code breed love for $21,000 off custom cabin pricing

00:24:54	basically infusing it with energy and information telling it what to do m so this is that like Cosmic decentralized Network you're maybe these are fractal layers right way this sun is telling us what to do we have little mini Suns being produced inside of us that are telling this what to do presumably the black hole at the heart of the Milky Way galaxy is maybe telling the Sun what to do through some other wave interaction we don't understand yet so that I mean going deep on this idea of fractal layers that's how you see it

00:25:22	it's like even the word Universe means one song right so it's one Cosmic Symphony of electromagnetism yeah and and you have to realize that what connects the hole is light remember light has unlimited range in power yeah the photon is and even matter is light by the way right a low frequency or frozen light we learned that in 1905 exactly from Einstein yeah energy look the mass equivalence equation yes plays a huge role here because when you look at e and you look at M right they're exactly the same thing but what does

00:25:55	Einstein put the C2 in for but he's telling you that the environment that the energy and mass in determines the reality we get between them wow and when you think about it like that so all this we're still catching up with that from 1905 oh yeah we still well no we still don't even understand like in medicine yeah we still don't fundamentally understand right that concept let me let me tell you just how broken this is if you want to break the fractal down which will really get us into probably an

00:26:25	interesting discussion um let's talk about what 1905 really did to uncover the farce that's at the base of centralized medicine anybody who's a scientist and even a non-scientist knows that we study things in medicine based on something called the randomized control clinical trial That's the basis of the scientific method what does in that WRA in that tussy Ru what does that really mean means that we could take a huge powered number get it down and try to extract the information out of that that's a

00:27:03	cause and effect idea okay that's based on a Newtonian version of reality 1905 told us that time is relative if time is relative what does that also mean there's no cause and effect we experience cause and effect as humans but that doesn't mean that it's true it's just our perception of reality and I just told you the electromagnetic spectrum 73 octaves we're blind to 72 of the octaves but yet we're using Newtonian physics to study the biggest questions that Humanity has now on chronic diseases so when you think about

00:27:45	what I'm saying to you and you think about what I said to Rick Rubin and uberman you know 18 months ago when I said most of what's in our textbooks is [ __ ] now you understand clearly why I'm saying because guess what we're blind to most of the problems and we're studying things utilizing physics that's not even true so this is this is an A change in ontology or a change in cosmology like it runs that deep basically oh I think I think the problems in medicine are humongous but the problem is th this discussion that

00:28:20	I'm having with you is so fundamental to the scientific method like people really don't understand truly what Einstein's relativity and mass equivalence really underpins and if there's no cause and effect everything is a probability who proved that beyond a shadow of a doubt that's Heisenberg the uncertainty principle yeah so when you actually see this say you Embrace this yeah then you have to come immediately as a biologist or a neurosurgeon and say to yourself as I did 20 years ago when I went through my notebook that I

00:29:01	told you about that I challenged my beliefs well if things aren't based on cause and effect why do I believe everything is based on a randomized control clinical trial maybe I need to start to question that amazing and that's what I did so okay what is it we can then learn perhaps from ancient wisdom Genesis Adam and Eve these were Co pre-scientific age cosmologies is there wisdom in there about your thesis about everything being light every obviously God said let there be light fat Lux we touched on that but are

00:29:37	there other um indications in ancient wisdom Traditions that lend themselves to support your view of the world yeah I think Genesis the Old Testament uh tells you that light is the key it doesn't give you the recipe our job as humanity is to figure out that recipe the story of Adam and Eve is actually Central ization and decentralization okay it's actually good and evil you have to embrace the suck if you don't embrace the suck you'll never get to the point of why life matters and why time matters um if you focus in on

00:30:14	too much on the good you you lose the benefit of the bad and the way I like to look at this is the light of the day is probably the good of things in life The Darkness at night we think of probably as Satan as heaven and hell but you can never understand the light without the darkness if you don't believe me go outside and look up and see Orion yeah you can't see Orion right now it's what 9:00 in the morning here in El Salvador but you know when we finish tonight we're going to be able to go out and see

00:30:48	that and what does that tell you that there's a benefit to the darkness so the key is intelligibility requires that contrast right otherwise it's not you can't perceive up without down well it does but I want to get to the the greater point that you asked me at because I don't want to lose this organized religion things in the Old and New Testament are like supplements they're half truths there's always an a kernel of Truth in them but it's our job to decide what's true and what's Superfluous what's the Via negativa so you and I had

00:31:21	a discussion before we started filming about your need for supplements and neurot Tropics before you started this and I told you that that the discussion that we have if it's good you won't need any of those things because you'll be stimulated by the biophotons between both of us and you know you're chuckling now but I think you're beginning to understand why I'm saying what I'm saying not only do I say it to you as a metaphor for the audience to understand this but actually it goes to eals mc²

00:31:49	that there is energy and information in the light that we're sharing that actually can Elevate or detract from the interaction between Robert and Jack right and I want the audience even though they have an ambient awareness of this interaction between us they're still getting a collision a compon scattering sure sure of this event and I want them to understand that the same thing is true with the Compton scattering I mean that visual that came up for me there was the particle accelerator images so that's what you're

00:32:21	saying two fields are interacting right and thenal effect yeah a lot of nonverbal communication and there's there there's always information that comes from the primaries right that's the interaction between light and water right right right okay and we think about life in centralized medicine begins and ends with RNA and DNA and it turns out it's actually not it's actually the other genome in the body that's the most important that deals with energy transformation which is the mitochondria DNA and RNA don't deal with

00:32:52	energy transformation they actually deal with a very interesting part they're the antenna that actually connects us to the hole that you asked about before the wireless system right and there's other Wireless Systems us you know so can we can we talk I introduce [[Semiconductors]] here because I thought this is a very this is a very nice bridge between a physical material technology that obviously uh is integral to a lot of the things that we use and it's a direct connection to what we sounds like what we actually are um and

00:33:27	so you you know semiconductors move energy through a crystal but this is imitating nature in some way it's like an idea that was stolen by Silicon Valley oh yeah well I mean where it starts though you how are we semiconductors and what are semiconductors I wouldn't say how are we I'd say we are semiconductors and who posed the question first to humanity in a speech in 1941 was Albert St Georgie he gave a speech to a group of medical students after he wanted to know about prize for a half truth that he talked

00:34:00	about the KB cycle and vitamin C he only got half the story right but we gave him a Nobel Prize anyway because it was important for what he did but the interesting part of the the speech that he gave to the medical students in Budapest was that he looked at the electronic structure of proteins by themselves because this is what he was working on in the KB cycle and with vitamin C he said it's very interesting they have an electronic structure that simulates what we see in semiconductors now this was Radical in 1941 why because

00:34:33	transistors hadn't even been discovered yet the fact that he had knowledge of what a semiconductor was also quite impressive for a doctor because he was an MD and he pointed this physical ability out to the medical student so who happens to listen to this 1941 lecture while he was a student in high school is actually [[Robert O Becker|Robert o Becker]] and [[Robert O Becker|Robert o Becker]] was stunned by this interaction why am I bringing this up to you this goes to my point that humans can be impacted by discussions to dissimilar beings where the collateral

00:35:13	effects caus Becker to do the things he did and you are able to sample Becker in the electric body so Becker goes on in his career gets his medical degree becomes an orthopedic surgeon makes the craziest decision ever to not go into private practice and make millions of dollars he becomes a simple doctor in a university military based system VA and proves that everything that Albert St Georgie said was true that we made out of semiconductors and what does he use as his his key protein in us he uses

00:35:49	bone because he's an orthopedic surgeon and how does he get interested in this he actually reads on the subject he finds out that the same things that are present in plants are present in us and then he has that come to Jesus moment where he looks at chlorophyll and he looks at hemoglobin and he goes God there's some so many similarities it's a nitride cage surrounded an atom the difference between the atoms iron and magnesium is 12 electrons and immediately he started to think about Albert St georg's admonition

00:36:23	in that 1941 uh lecture and he said I need to study this I need to find out do we grow do we regenerate is morphogenesis all tied to this idea of semiconduction in some way that idea in the 1950s was when I tell you beyond radical it's it's past the fringes yeah of science sure but that's how science begins it begins with an Outland this question and then you have to study it so he studies it and he uses simple forms of life that we all know he uses salamanders and frogs it was it was outlandish because they are mired in the

00:37:05	Newtonian world view is that right well I would say Newtonian worldview but I'd also say the Rockefeller view that was set up by the flexer report why because fleer's report removed vitalism which is the story of energy from medicine and put us more in the big Pharma modus operand you have to realize what happens between 1911 and 1950 is this is when Standard Oil gets blown up all the waste products from oil become big Pharma in New Jersey and Massachusetts and we are sold the story what reinforces the story of big Pharma

00:37:41	is actually Alexander Fleming when he finds penisin penicilin is the wonder drug for the war and drugs then replace everything then magically what happens right before Beck is Watson and Crick in 53 oh we found RNA and DNA so what happens there the Rockefeller people absorb the story of RNA and DNA link it to drugs voila you have centralized medicine and the story that Becker uncovers is actually the story before the flexer report actually where vitalism the world of Marone the world of hemholtz the world of clausus is is

00:38:21	vitalism saying that the cosmos is an organism something like that I would say you could say the cosmos is an organism but I would say the cosmos begins if you ask me energy like if you take cosmology and believe what they tell you in the Big Bang that this is this is the fallacy this is why I have a huge problem with Richard Dawkins he hates religion but he doesn't realize that at the basis of his own religion scientism is everything came from nothing sure if that's not crazy right I mean the story

00:38:57	of Adam and Eve in Genesis is not crazy I think the story of Genesis is more close to where physics begins and if you look at the story of the first 380,000 years that's when we called it the Dark Ages in cosmology the reason that everything is dark is because there's no stars yet matter has to organize into stars and when matter organizes into Stars light shows up and guess what happens when light shows up we see that Darkness can be lit but something magically happened there's Haze this would be the gases of matter floating in

00:39:37	space for that first 380 years so space initially the early formats is cloudy do you know what clears um the universe uh UV light stars begin to make UV light because those clouds Clump together and then become stars and they blow holes and the or bubbles in the cloud and start to clear it out but this is the key it's an opaque Universe in the beginning in other words it's chaotic and when UV light is emitted from these blue straggler stars starts to organiz we get clarity in other words it's not as opaque and then an evolution

00:40:21	begins so I would tell you the theory of evolution has its own holes bigger holes than even Richard Dawkins and remember these are the theories that are also absorbed by big farmer and Rockefeller into the RNA DNA story the story of vitalism the reason it didn't have a champion besides Lamar long time is because nobody knew about mitochondria it took until Doug Wallace comes along to figure out that this is an orgon L that Carl Sean's ex-wife if you don't know this Lyn Margolis uh she never got a Nobel Prize

00:41:02	probably because she had a vagina that she should have um she came up with the end the idea an original idea just like St George's idea was brilliant that there was an endosymbiosis where the first two domains of life got together 650 million years ago and created a ukaria and that was a mitochondria and a mitochondria is able not to create energy but to transform it and when you transform energy what are we saying there I want you to think about a mitochondria the way you think about a cell phone the cell phone seemingly is

00:41:37	able to pull out of The Ether around you the ability for you to say oh look what just happen today in Bitcoin here's the Bitcoin price a mitochondria did the same thing for you and me as complex life like when we talk about the asteroid that hits the planet 65 million years ago how t-rex's big huge dinosaurs shrink down to become birds that are flying in my yard right now and the little mammals that were under the ground that are furry become Robert and Jack it's it's like uh the reversals of Fortune This is actually how the

00:42:13	environment changed what happened in mitochondria and we were able to pull more energy and information out of the light than we were before and morphology changes right it's amazing uh this ongoing reciprocal reconstructive reality just always reshaping itself plus like Joseph shumer remember what he said creative destru creative destruction yeah of course so you said this earlier too all proteins are carbon-based semiconductors and we were you guys are having a discussion yesterday about carbon about the work of Robert pers and

00:42:49	Leela and how carbon's a very interesting element very has a great deal of ambiguity according to perig and that set off you talking about carbon as the The Da Vinci molecule so can we talk about that organisms as carbon based semiconductors and what is carbon what's so magical about it well carbon is magical on the Third Rock From the Sun because it has four veence electrons it's in group for the periodic table that means it can act like a metal a non-metal it can even act like a gas if you change its environment you change

00:43:24	its structure it gets new abilities it actually has the exact same abilities that water has and this is the reason why DNA only codes for carbon-based semiconductors and this is the part that centralized medicine forgets they forget that RNA and DNA is predominantly a protein story so when you think about RNA and DNA what what is the idea that I want to milk from St Georgie in the Becker story we just finished is that RNA and DNA are like AMD they are semiconductor Fabs but they only make one part of the semiconductor

00:44:08	since everybody identifies you with the Bitcoin and the Bitcoin guy I want you to think about a quarter so carbon is the head's side of the quarter water is the tail side what am I saying to you that nothing on Earth the three domains Aria back IIA or UK carots can live without having carbon and water fused to form that Union this is the marriage of man and woman this is however you want to phrase it this is the recipe of the cake that on this planet the environment that we're in 93 million miles from the

00:44:53	Sun this is ideal partner right where the redo state is magical you know with the 7.83 Herz with the type of light that's coming through ionosphere now you know 3.8 billion years ago the light that was coming through is radically different than it is now there's been an evolution of light on our planet as well as the life Evolution has changed why because it turns out bacteria and ARA actually change the environment that's actually how we get oxygen in the environment because we were initially in an anoxic

00:45:32	environment and um that fundamentally changed as well but the life that's changed over that time period has all been carbon based right we only know carbon based life that's the interesting part because if you think about it you may ask the question why is it that uh life has not chosen to use silicon why hasn't life chosen to use Boron why hasn't life chosen to use gold what is so magical about carbon I'm going to tell you that it's the true hermaphrodite on the periodic table just as hydrogen and oxygen are now

00:46:11	oxygen with hydrogen has some unique features like multi-purpose we're saying basically it can fit I wouldn't say multi-purpose I think the word chameleon that you use in the quote so very much like water as you said I All These Are chameleons what does that mean it's actually telling why Dawkins was was wrong why Darwin's wrong and why Lamar was partially right the environment sculpts the matter in us and it uses the energy and light to extract the energy and the information to do it so the fact

00:46:42	that and then we in turn do the same thing back to the environment but this is a biral you know antenna it's not a one-way approach and um and when you think about that from a physics standpoint that tells you that life is actually a black box radiator we connect with the sun and we go back that's the reason I tell my members that the Sun and your mitochondria have a lot in common not just the light emission but we are communicating back to the sun I believe through the collective beings that's on the planet in other words this

00:47:15	is a global electric current and do I believe that the current in the solar system also connects to the black hole in the center and all the other stars around yes and do I think it connects to Andromeda do I think it connects to Beetlejuice in Orion the answer is yes whole Galactic superclusters is like one big neuron or something and I would tell you that I think that CMEs coronal mass ejections are a function of what's going on on our planet do I think the Ultimate Reset for Humanity's use or mal

00:47:50	use of Technology will ultimately taken care of by our son I believe that will happen I believe the ultimate um string for the industrial military complex will be a coronal mass rejection like we last saw in the Carrington event in 1859 when Marone was alive and anything with a wire got zapped you think they'll trigger it oh I think we're going to trigger it that's very I think SC I think that's the trigger and what does that mean for Bitcoin uh doesn't mean anything cuz the people that built Bitcoin up were smart enough to put 133%

00:48:26	of the network on underground where it would be protected there's other places I think the bigger problem for a CME is what is JP Morgan Chase going to do yeah because they their network is really in trouble yeah I think the bigger part for Humanity to think about I mean we're happened to be in a country right now that just came through a civil war do you think the people in El Salvador will be fine living off the land compared to the people in Miami can you imagine what Miami would look like with no

00:48:56	supermarket market and no Total Wine and there's no deer down there running around yeah so when you think about the centralized world that the carbon based semiconductors in the United States sensitive to all of that infrastructure collaps so and even if you have your Bitcoin you begin to realize that the the basics the light water magnetism the food um how do we survive you know all of a sudden you begin to realize that there's a re ordering or a new hierarchy that comes to play we we often lose

00:49:32	sight as the silly talking monkeys that we are but a fabric in this quilt of nature this decentralized framework and we somehow think that we're Superior than the Rhino on the wall but I love uh Francis Bacon says nature to be commanded must be obeyed and so we've been commanding Jack Cruz a to be honest I mean that's really what my teaching is all about but that is what I've distilled down from St Georgie and Becker's work when you begin to understand that you are part of the decentralized network and you need to be

00:50:13	plugged into that but you need to understand what that means because this is nature is not the manufactured decentralized Network you know you know that as Bitcoin but Bitcoin and life have many things they share in common the big difference is the timestamping mechanism we use quantum mechanics in our mitochondria we use relativity Bitcoin uses Newtonian physics it rejects hours it rejects seconds but it use 10minute blocks to make an immutable Ledger in the digital space so that cause and effect happens

00:50:53	why because it turns out with money you need cause and effect right in other words it's critical so you're saying it creates linear time which is the time chain basically whereas our time is more cyclic well that's what a blockchain is if you think about it it's actually a a block time yeah it's a clock Bas right that's all it is and it measures entropy yeah but this is why you've heard me say multiple times that Bitcoin and mitochondri are both time machines I think when you now hear this laid out in

00:55:37	create a battery so it's a capacitator water effectively is an electromagnetic capacitator at a physics level yep and so the sunlight's splitting the water into positive and negative charges and then it's using that to create a battery and that's that's what life is yeah this is this is the basis of where actually life all begins this is the Compton scattering that we talked about with light and water so what did nature realize it could not split water with visible life that was visible light that was coming to the planet so it had

00:56:19	to put magnesium inside a nitride cage to do it so that's what chlorophyll effectively is if you look at chlorophyll and hemoglobin next to each other they look absolutely identical the only difference is the atom in the middle magnesium has 12 electrons and iron has 26 so you can see there's a difference and then you start thinking about our funny guy Einstein again who came up with the other magical paper which is the photoelectric effect the more electrons you have the more light you can use so again we're back to the

00:56:49	original idea you asked me about how do we extract more energy and information out of the environment you need more electrons to do it so then you asked me a question Jack what is Redux redo is the net negative charge in a Cell so the more negative charges you have the more energy and information you can Harvest from light yeah so what did nature do it it innovated the chemical the most important chemical before we became important which was magnesium chlorophyll and that allowed life to begin to extract energy and information

00:57:24	to create the first two domains of life which is bacteria and archa you know it best because the trees outside have green chlorophyll in it but there's bacteria that also have chlorophyll and and there's other types of chlorophyll that emit light but the goal is to extract the energy and information out that's the first layer of abstraction that chlorophyll gives you as a semiconductor what's the next layer when that abstraction happens water is physically changed from H2O because what happens water becomes oxygen hydrogen

00:58:03	and two electrons are liberated so remember what I told you if you can charge separate water into its original components you're making a positive charge fre H but you're freeing electrons and that is the dance of life okay so the words you just used nature realized nature innovated are you we're back to this idea of this whole thing being one big organism in which we are cells or participants somehow are you assigning a purpose orology to Nature itself like what is your philosophy of nature when you

00:58:41	invoke that word nature is the Big Bang nature is where something came from nothing in other words all the energy and information in the entire Cosmos is buried in light it needed to use other atoms on the periodic table to harness the recipe and it turns out every single spot in the world and in the cosmos has a different zip code that means the recipe will be different in every single place but what you and I are talking about right now is the recipe on the Third Rock From the Sun right that's the

00:59:20	one that we're most focused in on uh I would say probably the one that Elon Musk is most focused in on is the one on Mars the fourth Rock From the Sun and that one you know is very very different because it has no magnetic field compared to us is nature alive uh I believe when the forces of the three-legged stool interact abiotic atoms get the ability to become alive because they organize in other words entropy drops in the system this brings up very interesting discussion of Edwin schinger when he

01:00:00	wrote his book what is life in 1944 he actually termed um the most crazy term I think that's driven biologist crazy called negative entropy yeah negentropy right and it's it's almost as if life when you look at life is able to dance on the second law of Thermodynamics yeah and it turns out life is able to do that because it uses quantum mechanics right to it and that's where Quantum biology comes from this is this is the wizard behind the curtain of centralized medicine this is what Rockefeller the

01:00:35	flex report have wanted to block you from because they want you to stay in the noonian world so they can sell you drugs and vaccines makes sense um okay entropy we're describing clocks as these entropy flow meters this is a very complicated word uh it's been has sort of has two different meanings really right there's the entropy of physics and the entropy of communications Theory or information Theory I would tell you they're one and the same there are over there's overlap between them um John Wheeler says

01:01:07	they're the same yeah John physicist John Wheeler so what entropy and physics the way I've I've kind of heard it described is if you have uh like a gas chamber that's partitioned down the middle and you have all the gas in one side you have more knowledge about the location of those molecules so therefore there's harness of energy because if you remove that partition that'll actually release energy but after the fact you have less knowledge about the location of the particle so You' you've used some

01:01:32	of the energy and increased entropy as a result then the entropy of communications theory is something more like you know what range of possibilities is the broadcaster of a message able like how much surprise is going to be in the message right well that's what Claud Shannon's paper in 48 was all about he found that the single most important thing in communication was how unusual the message was yes so information is surprise something like so given the importance of entropy and everything that we're talking about can

01:02:01	we get a nice unpacking and definition of that in both a physics sense and a Communications Theory sense or they overlap well I I actually I the the way you're framing the I guess the question I would fundamentally disagree with I think energy and information are equivalent okay so this is actually like Einstein's idea and there is a there's a law of conservation of information just like there is a law ofation that law is not in thermodynamics it's actually in Quantum thermodynamics okay so that's

01:02:35	where you have to realize we're now Bridging the classical world yeah and the quantum mechanical world and you have to realize what is the the laws of nature based on quantum mechanics not Newtonian physics so when you begin to understand this you begin to understand that what is life fundamentally doing with entropy it's giving us the ability to extract energy and information from everything so what is the goal of a cell goal of a cell is to store energy and information at the vibrational level in a cell that

01:03:11	means the bonds between the atoms that means the electrons in there that have been powered up or down by light there's energy constantly in the system the the thing that centralized medicine wants you to believe is that all high energy or the battery is an ATP we already know that that's a [ __ ] story Gilbert Ling in the 1950s did the thermal dynamics of ATP we don't make enough ATP in our body to explain how life exists therefore hither to and moreover Peter Mitchell's you know Nobel prize from

01:03:43	1977 is [ __ ] now biologists are going to listen to this and their heads are going to explode but that's actually what Gilbert Ling has said for the longest time and the funny thing about Peter Mitchell and Gilbert Ling you know I know this implicitly as a neurosurgeon um we don't have any machines in neurosurgery that were made from chemo osmotic theory of Peter Mitchell but you know what we do have from Gilbert Lings work we have an MRI machine and I use an MRI machine in every single patient and

01:04:17	from that I can determine what their redo state is I can see the positive and negative charges I can see what matter and water are doing I can tell you if you have a brain tumor I can tell you what the type of brain tumor is in other words I'm able to extract energy from the system that I can't utilizing Peter Mitchell's idea the only thing I can extract from Peter Mitchell's idea it explains the inner mitochondrial membrane and why proton gradients are important I'm not trying to tell you what Peter Mitchell discovered isn't

01:04:47	important I'm trying to tell you it's kind of like organized religion it's a Hal truth in other words it explains a very small swath of what's in biology but we've ascribed it massive implications like this is the Jesus moment and it's not and in fact where most of the energy for a cell comes from is from the interaction between light and water to create these electrons the real goal of quantum biology is you there is a millions of electrons buried in water light liberates those electrons just as you would in a semiconductor

01:05:23	when light hits silicon you get light that's what a light emitting diode is that light that comes out is different than the light comes in in other words it's different frequency a different Lux that means you're extracting different parts of energy from the original light source that's effectively what a mitochondria is doing so when you take all these different pieces because what I just told you you re replay this back I just gave you a lot in a very short piece of information but that extraction

01:05:52	process through which energy is obtained is also generating the exhaust of entropy is that the way to understand exactly just like the partition being removed well think about the exhaust of entropy of of quantum biology what's the exhaust of mitochondrial metabolism it's actually the light that's the biophotons we emit carbon dioxide which we breathe out yeah and then the free radicals that are made at all the cytochrom so that would be hydron peroxide the hydroxy free radical the Fenton reaction nitric

01:06:24	oxide hydrogen sulfide all of these things are exhaust but they're useful to us in some way the key is I was going to say don't they become inputs to another system they do well because remember nature never wastes things so the entropy is relative in a way there you go now you're beginning to understand Uncle Jack a little bit because you're beginning to understand that nature is because what's in very very crafty what's entropy to us right we go drop some feces in the toilet but that's energy to the Fly Right correct so well

01:06:58	not only that it also does other things in the system the interesting thing is we take our FES and you know dump it into the sewer system but does the cow do that does the the horse do that no it drops it in the field and the farmer knows how to make better use of the turd yeah than we do in the centralized system right that's actually you know the the argument of the sustainable farmer it's the argument of show Berger it's the argument of right so this is the part that I'm I'm trying to explain to you that the

01:07:32	centralized systems in and around us actually what made big farmer manifest within centralized medicine and I think fundamentally the reason why you don't understand decentralized medicine which is really quantum mechanical is because it's been screwed over by the Rockell idea of Newtonian physics right that there is cause and effect and we want to keep you there because that's the gold standard if we can keep you focused on RNA and DNA you'll never get to the mitochondrial DNA thing where actually

01:08:03	true energy transformation and entropy enter into the equation I think there might be a key to understanding the world here I don't have this is just a dim apprehension I'm trying to throw some light around but entropy then seems to have this subjective aspect where it is very much based on your aim and purposes right whether this is energy to you or entropy to you but it also has this very objective aspect where it can be you know codified and Quantified in terms of bits right the number of binary digits necessary to

01:08:34	encode a message uh there's also the measure of entropy in physics which escapes me I forget the the term for that um but so entropy maybe properly understanding entropy somehow lets us figure out the union between the Continuum between subjective and objective reality like what I don't know if I would I I don't know if I would break it down that way how do we demystify entropy for people to get like their feet on the ground in this cosmology that you're building given that inop is so important to the existence of time

01:09:07	time to the clocks I'll tell you how I break it down for patients I tell them to think about a refrigerator yeah a heat pump right we put food in there to save it and we think that somehow the refrigerator is removing the heat uh and we don't have any idea of where that Heat's going but it turns out we're dumping that heat into our kitchen because all you have to do is put your hand behind the fan in other words the energy of the total system of the fridge is exactly the same because the energy

01:09:39	is now in your kitchen it's just not inside your ice box and the same thing is true with us like we look at our bodies as closed systems but if you looked at the entropy that we're turning back into the environment those things are being used by the trees right so like when I say to people there's data out there that if you cut trees down in your environment yeah that things around you will die right that should not Shock you when you hear it it shocks people who are centralized because they're like

01:10:09	wait a minute we are actually en TI uh entangled to the environment we're in it turns out we are so like when we think about the Amazon rainforest and what we're doing there it shouldn't shock you that you know we've killed 550,000 people in Co you know because there actually is an entanglement to that the problem is most people don't think decentralized like the Lorent effect is that's what the butterfly effect is that you know when the butterfly flaps the wings that something can get a tornado in Texas that paper's

01:10:41	written in ' 67 but we don't realize that we're experiencing entropy right now because centralized humanity is doing bad things that the effect is coming back on us in ways that we're not cognizant right I mean this is karma right I mean well you could call it karma but I think what I'm trying to explain to you is I think this is entropy entropy okay okay so you have this Energy Information equivalence on one side of this coin and then there's entropy on the other but again it's sort of relative but also sort of not there's

01:11:19	something there's there's an absolute but there's also a relative aspect to entropy and energy so I think there's an absolute when you think about thermodynamics but I think when you understand that entropy still needs to be thought of on a relative basis because remember you in my house right now you're in a relative basis I can't think about the totality of the cosmos and Robert in it in other words you're changing the entropy of this room right and you're changing my entropy so but based on certain physical laws right

01:11:54	that there are laws B but just think about it a cup of coffeee is actually a clock how can you tell when Shantel first makes it for you you have it it's hot and then you can actually tell as it loses temperature you can feel it from your perception but how else could you tell if you look at the coffee itself there'll be Raleigh ber Cycles in the coffee that are going especially if you put milk in it yeah and then I want you to think about garbage garbage can also be a clock why if you have fish or meat

01:12:30	in the garbage and the first two days it doesn't smell that day three day four you start to go hey you know what the garbage man hasn't come picked up my garbage it's starting to stink everything can be thought of as a clock but we don't think of everything as a clock as a clock because everything is an event correct and that is is where how I describe it to my P and I tell them that the clock in US is a very special clock it's an optical lattice clock in the super cosmatic nucleus that uses the visible spectrum to tell time

01:13:09	in us and it turns out out of the visible spectrum there's one specific part of that alphabet so for example I told you there's 73 octaves in the electromagnetic spectrum I told you visible lights one so now we're doing a fraction of one letter okay so in other words this would be like maybe thinking about alpha or Omega in the Greek alphabet to describe the letter A okay so what is that part that part is blue light blue light is actually how our clock tells circadian time how do we know that it's 9:00 in the morning from

01:13:49	9:00 at night and it turns out that we've stolen proteins from animals that came before us specifically amphibians and why was this important because that's actually what Becker did Becker studied salamanders and frogs and noticed there was a difference in their regeneration patterns he actually figured out that it was tied to some of the changes in their body and it turned out it was tied to light uh it was also tied to their clock mechanism and the reason why we don't exhibit the Regeneration of Sou

01:14:26	salamanders happens to be because we extract energy even more so from the system so there's not energy left over in the system so that we can you know renovate or regenerate our brain our heart we co-opted that energy flow for higher cognition correct wow and that's exactly this is that relativity of entropy you're talking about in other words the difference between us and chimps and monkeys let's talk about the entropy dump between us I'm not going to assume you know this but if you listen to the uberman podcast because I really

01:14:59	laid this out in detail yeah I told you that whether you believe in god of evolution it doesn't matter I just want you to accept this for right now there are cousins okay their genome is almost exactly identical to us there's only a difference of a couple of uh genes but yet we look so different but here's the funny thing silly talking monkeys live 30 to 40 years longer than monkeys so you have to ask yourself why is there such a difference yet there's so much similarity turns out is the entropy dump

01:15:32	what we do we started to use things specific things in this one gene pomy that on gorillas was on chromosome 24 we moved to a different chromosome we made it more thermally efficient that allowed us to extract more information from sunlight what did we do do with that energy of entropy we dumped it into our immune system from that dump the collateral effect is the formation of the human brain in other words to improve our immune system we also got the brain out of this change the interesting part of this why

01:16:10	this is important Story one of the guys in the room with us was asking a question about hey Jack you know we smell uh oh yeah our our you know perspective mates right and why is this a big deal when I'm telling you the story now you're beginning to understand why from an evolutionary standpoint this is so far back because we innovated our immune systems from the same tissues that we did our brain so what do we want if we want to increased longevity we have to have dissimilar immune system complimentary immune system so that we

01:16:43	can fight against the things in nature that were going to take us out wow that was our superpower in the beginning and as our superpower continued to evolve and we use the energy dump the immune system got strong we were able to pull more off we buried more mitochondria in our brain we subtracted it from our big muscles and our guts We Shrunk that 30 feet magically where do we bury our mitochondria then in our hearts and our brains gorillas and chimps buried in their muscle skeletal system why because

01:17:15	they had to climb through trees they were grounded they were able to do that and what did we do our superpowers we figured out how to use the Palm SE Gene Pro opoman yeah and we made the most incredible semiconductor better than chlorophyll better than hemoglobin called [[Melanin]] yeah and what does [[Melanin]] do melanin is the most special semiconductor on the planet what is that semiconductor it absorbs all frequencies of light even frequencies of light not in our sun so what does that mean we are able to now

01:17:50	harness all the energy and information that around us here's the interesting what's the trip wire for silly talking monkeys that you and I have been talking about now for two days the trip wire is pomy only gets translated with UV light so Robert what has the world taught you in your young life that UV light is a toxin right right that you should put sunen onction and you should wear clothes and you should have glasses you South where we didn't do that [ __ ] but it's funny though yesterday when we're in the

01:18:30	in the the kitchen you said Jack is this like we're going to go back as bitcoiners and run around naked in our own compounds there was once a guy many years ago he said he had a deep intuition that Bitcoin revolutionizing the world was going to lead us to become a global nudus Colony or a global nudus Society I guess and guess I never put those pieces together but then as you were talking yesterday about all the benefits of ball sunning and ass sunning and all these things oh maybe this is this is what's going to happen we're all

01:19:01	going to become Quantum biologists walking around naked in the sun all the time that's how we get the usefulness of the energy dump you don't realize that the entropy dump for us is actually what created our immune system and and human brain and why do I want to make this parallel to you because what does this mean this means that we gained 30 to 40 years longevity so I want to do a hard stop with you you as is a Bitcoin or me is a Bitcoin and me is the Quantum biologist remember when I said to you

01:19:29	that Bitcoin and mitochondria are time machines now I just proved it to you why because our nearest living relative who's very closely aligned with our RNA and DNA I mean I told you the story about [[Kevin McKernan]] working on the human gnome project we only found 300 genes difference between us and chimpanzees right we thought we thought we were going to have 100,000 and they were going to have 203 24 there's only 300 difference and what's one of the major differences this damn little palm SE Gene that makes all these 10 little

01:19:59	chemicals and it turns out the difference of where they put their [[Melanin]] and where we put our melanin that's the thing that sculpted us and that's the thing that Des sculpted them and so we Amplified the evolution of our hearts and Minds it sounds like I would tell you that we Amplified first our immune system second our probably brains third our heart and then the muscle skel remember bipedalism changed our skeleton yeah do you subscribe to the theory too that when we started cooking food that

01:20:33	it liberated more nutrients and helped accelerate cognitive development I I think that's a [ __ ] alpath functional medicine story okay do I like it I like it and I'll tell you why because in it is buried to half truth so for me this is like a supplement the one thing I will tell you that I think the raw Foodies do have right is raw food has more biophotons in it than cooked food right so I'm going to tell you it wasn't cooked food that was the advantage yeah the fresher food is that it's not frozen it's not cap that's the

01:21:04	food we want to eat how do we know that's true now cooked meat even though cuz certain meats you can't even eat without cooking them right well yeah but mean just think about um um I'm blanking on the name what's that stuff Sean tell you like this Thin Meat I'm blanking on no what no no car kpao kpao so kpao is you know raw meat and if you think about sushimi for the Japanese raw fish we now have things that we didn't have before called Optical scanners and I don't know if you know this but how does Walmart

01:21:40	and Whole Foods charge Farmers or pay them more money for organic foods they now cut their wees bring it to us and we use an optical photonic scanner to find out how many biophotons in it turns out when we cook something we reduce the light in it so but but something like a brisket that you can't even eat without cooking it well you say you can but but the the ancient people could do it and they did do it and you want to know the funny part is it's too t you have to do you got to dissolve it or something

01:22:12	right you that's why you have teeth that have no cusps on it you're actually designed try to eat a raw brisket but um yeah that would be quite I'm just gonna tell you I've got blogs written about this that believe it or not you look at chimp teeth they have Predator teeth we don't we have the teeth of herbivores do you know why that seemingly mismatch is there because we're designed not to chew our food as much not to process it that's also why our guts are smaller oh and we have a protein in our that's from

01:22:42	figuring out cooking or why did it's not figuring out cooking it's actually figuring out the entropy dump what did we do we stole our energy for our immune systems and the formation of our brain so that meant very much like your story before about root canals and Lykan planet we had to steal this is the Robin Hood story we had to steal from another area to improve us this is my argument that I've had for a long time with guys like Peter aan uberman that they think burying our mitochondria in the wrong

01:23:15	place is a good idea as we age energy in US is a zero some game we're designed to bury it here and here this is the reason why humans die of brain disease heart disease more than anything else uh the second or third most common thing we die from is problems related to the immune system for the reason I just mentioned to you this is why autoimmunity is now spiked up in the last 120 years it's also the reason why infectious disease was the number one cause of death in 1900 those things have been mitigated by

01:23:44	the things that we've done in our environment mostly sanitation centralized medicine especially now want you to believe it's vaccines right but it's just not true it's it's mostly sanitation and the key thing is I'm going to tell you that the the question you ask me about cooking I I think it can unlock your ability to eat more things make you more of an omnivore but if you were to ask me as a Quantum biologist raw food that's fresh is much better than things that are processed or prepared fresh and local correct well you want

01:24:23	local because you want to make sure that the the the sun has imprinted its photosynthetic barcode into the food that you're at locally so for example if you and I went out to Monarca tonight and ate a lamb from New Zealand which we will we probably be making a mistake you know from doing something like that that's something I always try to tell people why you the animals need to be local yes wow okay that's difficult before starting the what is money show I spent most of my career as a CFO overseeing internal technology

01:24:58	implementations and business Acquisitions over the next 10 years it is projected that over 12 million businesses in the US will be sold if you are an operator running a business generating between 5 and $200 million of Revenue and you're considering selling your business within the next decade then there is a significant opportunity for you to deploy technology to streamline business processes reduce operating cost and enhance the multiple your business ultimately sells for to this end I am partnering with the team

01:25:29	at emerge Dynamics a firm with Decades of experience and maximizing the value of privately held small and Middle Market businesses go to emerg dynamics.com breed love to learn how you can build an attractive High multiple company that maximizes your return When you fully exit again that's emerg dynamics.com Breedlove back to photo so photosynthesis is one of these processes that's extracting energy right or creating energy liberating photons y um what is it about why is this process so key to understanding the human cell or we're we

01:26:11	don't practice we don't do photosynthesis or do we yes we do we do okay that's actually the story that I just show you about [[Melanin]] guess what melanin does melan absorbs all frequencies to light and liberates four electrons actually it has the ability yeah to liberate double the amount and what we think now based on what condensed matter physicists are doing you may not know this you know who's studying melanin now no NASA they're putting it in the ISS why because they just found out that you can create a massive amount of

01:26:45	electrons so if you think about Elon musk's World any place where you can extract more energy means you have to use less fuel to get to where you need to go so now they're studying melanin and this is the most amazing part of I think the uberman Reuben podcast that went you know untalked about huberman's Dad is a condensed matter physicist and he knows a lot about melanin and he told Andrew that um they were studying this but he had never put two and two together the reason why it's so important do you know that we don't even

01:27:20	know the true Atomic um structure of melan and why because do you know how we check atomic structure like say if we want to find out what's in an apple or your eyewatch we use x-ray do it when you use X-ray on melanin the x-rays get absorbed so here's the crazy thing the Russians have found out uh there's a a fungus that's growing in Chernobyl called cryptococcus Neo formans cryptococcus is stained Brown why because it has melanin in it do you know what melanin is doing it's absorbing all the radiation in there so this fungus is

01:27:57	growing like crazy why because the fungus is using the radiation as energy you got it wow so when you begin to realize W there's another one of those entropy energy cases right exactly but I'm trying to bring you to the next stage Usain Bolt Usain Bolt famously told uh cus after he won his F gold medals cus asked him in NBC how did you train for this and he famously said on live TV I ran on a volcano in my underwear and I ate chicken McNuggets and people couldn't believe he said that because you know the dominant belief is exercise

01:28:34	and diet is the way to Optimal Performance and optimal life and Longevity and here Usain Bolt a black guy from Jamaica at the 20th latitude who lives on a volcano broke that narrative up and everybody thought it was a joke but he wasn't joking what so what's he getting from the volcano a ton of liberated electrons magnetic flux wow what do you know what do you know remember when we talked about the term you asked me before you said electromagnetism is this so there's an electric field and a magnetic field that

01:29:06	run orthogonal what does that mean 90 de to each other who described that in the 1860s Maxwell those are Maxwell's laws yeah for electromagnetism in physics textbooks when you open them up these are considered history books of science yeah what do I need to teach you about this there's there's a thing coming you may be shocked to know that when the laws of electron magnetism was shrunk to four Oliver Heath side got the original stuff there was actually 22 and now in physics books we've shrunk them

01:29:42	to four so guess what I'm going to tell you the forces no this is the laws the mathematical equations that describe Maxwell's equations they've shrunk them to four yeah I'm going to tell you shrink M to four was like using chat gbt to read a book in other words we left some fat on the bone so I always tell people you might want to go back and take a look at all of heathside work about how he parsed out electromagnetism because I think we're missing things in physics because of this I think some of

01:30:15	the big mistakes that we made in physics the last 120 years is tied to this and the point that I like to bring out to physicists that they don't like is there's a a consequence in uh Maxwell's original equations of 22 the shrink got rid of the idea of a magnetic monopole which is tied to this story about magnetism since we've never experienced a magnetic monopole in reality we just act like it doesn't exist but the interesting thing is Paul durak what is a magnetic monopole it's a it's a consequence of the electromagnetic

01:30:51	spectrum in other words mathematics like an absolute well it's a proof it's an axiom we know that the math says it can exist okay but because we haven't found yet science centralized physics yeah acts like it doesn't exist right and it turns out why is a magnetic monopole really important well Tesla used this idea that if a monopole exists you can form unlimited energy right from a source this was his idea that was buried yeah zero Source energy correct and it was also what he morphed out in his mind

01:31:28	with Warden Cliffe in Long Island and the thing that people have forgotten is go back to the original formulation of the ideas and realize that what's in the history books is written by The Victors the physicist will have you believe that we only need four equations to describe this I'm going to tell you that your children or your grandchildren are going to find out that those other equations that We Shrunk are probably going to be important somewh down the road and what are the names of those equations again Maxwell's equations for

01:32:04	electromagnetism no no but the 22 the 22 is uh Oliver heathside is the guy Oliver Heath side that really talked about them and thought that it was the biggest mistake ever that physics got rid of all of them and the last physicist that really talked about this publicly was Paul dur and Paul durak uh is a famous guy he's the guy that figured out that there was antimatter remember antimatter is something we can't see that's where he came up with the idea of positron and it turned out after you know his life is

01:32:40	over we actually definitively proved that this actually really does happen my point is that we're going to find out the magnetic monopole is part of the reason why usin Bolt won five gold medals we just don't know it yet and that's the reason why he was able to eat chicken McNuggets and do it because it turns out there was a greater energy source that he was tapping from with his semiconductors and remember he's a black black dude yeah so he is able to harness him what did I tell you about melanin in

01:33:13	darkness dark semiconductors absorb more frequencies of light yeah so that means Usain Bolt is more thermally efficient than Robert Bri lover Jack Cruz because why we're northern European times far away from it I'm really different cuz I'm only Usain Bolt in my freckles yeah have freckles you got Freckles but you got a good tan you live in Miami and I live down here and the point that I'm trying to say is we can Elevate our melanation not melanation melanation externally but it turns out the melanin

01:33:52	on the inside of us from palm seed yeah is actually what determines how many free electrons we can make why because the question that you started this whole thing off with Jack is animal photosynthesis possible it became possible yeah because of this palc Gene okay so super fascinating stuff I want to ask you this is a bit of a tangent but um I've just been thinking about it so entropy as uncertainty or disorder and then entropy also as um unusable energy useless energy something like that so it's kind of has this

01:34:30	informational and physical stop for a minute I'm I'm going to stop you before you even ask the question because now you got me thinking I want you to think about the difference in the the walk we just took chlorophyll to hemoglobin to melanin what did I just tell you on a relative basis we just walked through 3.8 billion years of of history when we use chlorophyll by itself it wasted energy when we use hemoglobin we wasted energy we get to melanin it absorbs all the energy that those two lost that means more comple

01:35:01	technology correct wow so you get more complex life so what am I trying to say to you how did we go from ARA and bacteria to UK carots to us the story is the semiconductors got more efficient yeah so in other words entropy we got better and managing it over time that's the story of quy so nature is innovating life just as life human life innovates technology correct okay so that is we are actually participating in the Divine Play of creation correct when we engage in creation we also I want you to

01:35:38	remember what I said to you yesterday the same key opens up the door to heaven and hell so that also means that there's a negative connotation for us for the use of technology and what's the negative connotation then there's a reason I'm bringing this up right now use of Technology non-native [[Non-Native Electromagnetic Fields|EMF]] blue light actually degrades melanin right so if you degrade melanin that means you have to have a pathway to make it so which is why sunning your balls your ass your gut you begin to understand why this important because you have to

01:36:11	constantly get the UV and infrared light to renovate the melanin in you wow to create the free electrons and the more you're Tech addicted like say you are Jack dorsy you're Robert breeda you know you pick out like how finny yeah Paul Allen [[Steve Jobs]] they're dead because they never broke this idea of entropy yeah and you and I are trying to break this down and you're down here trying to do an amazing podcast and I'm down here trying to tell you there is a way for you to fix your weakest link when you understand the basics of what

01:36:50	was in that amazing lecture in 1941 by St Georgie that Becker then open the key I want you to understand that the sword has two edges yes understood understood it's a it's a tool right correct aoral this is a a tangent I want to take with you um money printing use the term iny dump it does seem like when you print money in an economy you are definitely dumping entropy right well you're dumping energy and information but it's useless you're stealing energy through you're stealing purchasing power you're externalizing

01:37:27	entropy in the form of price signal Distortion inflation wealth disparity it's funding Warfare It's funding fake news it's creating it's creating the fake life that you've grown up in yeah so is this actually me too is this kind of the the if we're looking at the geopolitical global border as kind of an organism metaphor are these little entropy dumps that are occurring all over the world the pathology that this organism is suffering from yes and what was you know Bitcoin has a solution to that Bitcoin bcoin is like melanin

01:38:03	Bitcoin Taps into the deepest entropy through the mining algorithm to construct almost perfect order basically right in AR I would I wouldn't say it's perfect I would say when you think about money and value like indisputable history I guess what I'm getting at that I that I do agree with I would tell you that I think it's an interesting analogy to marry melanin to bitcoin when it comes to money I think that's a very apropo way to look at it because it makes money more effective I think what so melanin is Energy savings technology

01:38:37	correct okay because it maximizes the dump of entropy so that we can make the energy and information in money useful and when you think about money like I think about light you begin to understand that light has every everything in it and it's not encumbered by mass that's what makes it so amazing and the craziest part of light we haven't talked about this yet but maybe you'll be interested because of where you just took this with Bitcoin light doesn't experience time like in other words photons yeah they're Eternal

01:39:13	photons are Eternal and they experience no time but guess you accelate something to the speed of light it it's only moving through space not time but when light slows down it becomes matter and then it experiences time yeah and I would tell you the interesting thing is could you look at Bitcoin actually the same way that when a minor mines it it is eternal and then when it's physically minted and it goes into a Minor's wallet it then begins to experience time and what is time for a Bitcoin that's been

01:39:49	minted it's kind of what I say about health health is the slowest form of death we can create so maybe Bitcoin that's in someone's wallet is the slowest form of Money death yeah that we have even though it does have a time frame maybe you know I can hear like American hoddle in my ear now saying yeah it's going to be that Quantum damn computer when it comes it's going to [ __ ] us all up but you know eventually will the entropy dump from Bitcoin likely create a new technology that still makes Bitcoin well if it got us to

01:40:27	Zero Point Energy at some point that could actually put us into a post money World correct because economic scarcity would wouldn't go to zero because we'd still have time and physical space but it would go very very low yes and I I do I think physically that's possible like the discussion you and I are having right now is very similar to the discussion that we just had about magnetic monopoles like just because it doesn't exist in the world now the this is the beauty of our our brain yeah our brain is able to

01:40:56	conceptualize ideas that don't physically exist and we can have a discussion about them yeah and you know people in the audience will look at this and say these two guys are [ __ ] esoteric idiots but when you actually think about this this is actually what game theory and Bitcoin is all about it's actually what my job's about it's I'm game theing out my the colony of mitochondria and then trying to explain to people how this affects like your gut your brain your body like you know why did Jack go back into the hospital and

01:41:26	you know ruin his biology to get an answer because I had plenty of free time due to my Bitcoin and I thought helping Humanity out realizing who the [ __ ] criminals were were important I made I made the decision to spend my time that way you're going to make the decision to spend your time that you gained from Bitcoin differently the two guys behind the cameras here are going to make their determination shant going to make her determination but here's the funny thing since all five of us are in this room

01:41:59	there's a collective energy dump that's going on amongst all of us now and we're now thinking about it because you just asked me the question and because we're thinking about this now yeah this actually is probably going to bring other things to light like you're going to go home and lay in bed and go wow this is a really interesting game theory thing to think about what's life after Bitcoin when things have been settled yeah because I've been thinking about um the issue between uh Maxwell and Heath side and

01:42:32	why we subtracted out all those equations I think is a catastrophic and what did we lose in your opinion primar I think we lost curiosity well I mean in the translation of those equations sounds like it wasn't uh the data compression was maybe too extreme we with the bath water I don't think that we really believe it was extreme yet because we haven't found this magnetic monopole in nature now there has been that sounds very theological in its import is I would say I would say I'm gonna be honest with you and I'm not trying to

01:43:06	pound you here it's kind of like what we talked about right before this podcast about reading a book and getting the cliff notes yeah you know through say AI or the way we used to do it like reading the cliff notes you lose the essence of what the original science was and what is what is Maxwell telling us Maxwell's telling us this is the essence of light like uh the beautiful thing about fman Ferman said something that was magnificent because he was the original human computer that General grov used in

01:43:38	the Manhattan Project um but he said mathematics can never explain nature all it can do is describe it and because math can only describe it math can never be used more than that and yet what have modern physics done for the last 120 years tried to break that Axiom that phin brought to us and I think when you understand the way we understand light right now is through four equations you're like wait a minute if the decentralized network of nature light is this powerful why would we ever want to put a bottleneck on it

01:44:17	to make it easier for us to understand because what if it turns out the most important part of nature is what we throughout with the bathwater doesn't that seem so crazy yeah I mean isn't this the game right is we we're trying to generalize and then specify and then over times we over generalize specify I think we do it over fitting or underfitting to use AI terms well I think we do it because of our brains why because well we're trying to economize ultimately so you can go from 22 to four equations well our brain

01:44:51	cannot uh everybody thinks our brain can multi task yeah data has been done on that using functional MRI we're really not good at doing that and it has to do with the way our brain's constructed we're really good at picking up Trends but we're not really good with multitasking and because we're not good with multitasking I think we tend to try to parse nature out in a more linear fashion than a practical fashion sure sure sure and that's what makes us that's what gives us human nature that's the reason why we're flawed yeah

01:45:23	we are not the ideal Messenger to harvest yeah the energy and information and light but we do it in the most parsimonious fashion this is where aam's razor comes in and this is when I scream at people like Dawkins or Brett Weinstein and all this like they always say well aam's Razer is the best way to go and I'm like aam's razer's [ __ ] there's nothing parsimonious about the photo electric okay like anybody who knows anything about physics you go back and look at where Helm Holtz brought us at the end

01:45:58	of the the 19th century we have this thing called the ultraviolet catastrophe it Vex the best Minds in physics for a long time and along comes a burn um agent sitting in a thing having a dream about traveling on a lightning bolt and figuring out that time is relative and then this photo electric effect he actually when Einstein described the photoelectric effect after he wrote the paper it's the most amazing story and it's the reason why I kind of rever him for his mind and his thinking there's no there's absolutely

01:46:38	no footnotes in his four Miracle papers why because they're all thought experiments so he famously said he goes well I looked at what Helm holds did I looked about what Herz did I looked at the thermodynamic gens and he goes I figured out the photoelectric effect this is the only way it could work could you expand on what the photoelectric effect is yeah it's the electrons in an atom gets liberated electrons are able to absorb light when we say absorb light they take the energy of light they go from the

01:47:10	ground state to Elevation so for example the UV light that's out in the nature right now around us that's liberating some electrons that are getting liberated from the chlorophyll in the trees and they go from say the ground state that's red light let's just say for argument sake 700 nanomer light the UV light comes in and that light is two say 260 that electron got elevated so that means when that electron is got 260 light it can fall back to the ground state when it does that the electron gives off the photon to things in the

01:47:46	environment and we're able to use it got it so like when you sit on molecular mining for electron energ or so like if you want to brainstorm one of the best places for you to brainstorm sit under tree sit under a tree wow that's why lions do it interesting what um okay what do I want to go next oh band gaps band gaps in a semiconductor what's the difference between narrow and broad-based semiconducting that one simp and how does it relate to the electron transport chain well it's it this is a good segue for what we just said it's

01:48:19	actually a kind of a photoelectric effect but it's a little bit different the way you think about band gaps band gaps determine how much light is given off by a semiconductor so for example when you have a wideband semiconductor they can give off light UV and above so this explains the reason why when I first started to go down this path 20 years ago learning about melanin when I looked at leptin's band Gap or I looked at I should say it's a absorption spectra I saw that it was 220 nanometers and then I looked at it I said wait a

01:48:55	minute 220 nomers is not made by the Sun how can our most powerful hormone in the body that goes from our sub fat to our hypothalamus have an an absorption Spectre that's not even it's more powerful than the sun I did the same thing Einstein did I said that means we have to be making light inside the light has to be coming from somewhere else then I started to realize the story about chlorophyll hemoglobin and melan I'm like oh that's it melanin melanin is a wide B wideband semiconductor it makes light in the VV

01:49:29	range then immediately it dawned on me oh [ __ ] all the aromatic amino acids go from 200 to 400 anomet light that's also light stronger than the Sun but all the key chemicals in us like for example the question you just asked me cytochrome one in the mitochondria which is NAD positive nadh which most people know about they know that when we age nadh uh drops okay okay that's why you have guys like David Sinclair try to sell retards um you know supplements for NAD we know that that doesn't work um but

01:50:03	what his paper showed in 2013 is that when we do age NAD does drop well NAD well n the n in NAD stands for nicotinamide nicotinamide is nicotine goes back to the story we had talked about earlier and nicotine also has a band Gap that's strong in the UV range so you begin to realize wow like inside of us we're able to absorb different frequencies of light in different areas in other words all these semiconductors are making light and we're using that entropy yeah to run different systems the problem is we're not getting any of

01:50:40	that information from biochemistry books like Robert can't open up you know leninger biochemistry and find out that cytochrome 1 emits light at 340 NM but that effectively what happened you can't look look up in a regular standard uh biochemistry book and see that the absorption Spectre of of me of leptin is 220 you can't look and find out that vitamin A when it gets liberated from an opsin as a as a photonic chemical has an absorption Spector of 328 nmet this is this is because we're at the dawning of

01:51:14	the new science that is quantum biology right yeah I mean this is this this actually pinpoints another inflection point for me where I get into trouble with a lot of the food gurus on the internet when I met with Ray Pete this is the reason why I knew Ray Pete was a fraud and I don't mean a fraud in a bad way it's kind of like the thing I told you about earlier about ignorance and fraud like where's your line and when I sat down with Ray I realized his was more ignorance it wasn't fraud Cali means I'm not con convinced of that I

01:51:46	still think there's some fraud to it yeah and um when I presented Ry with the absorption and Mis inspect of all the things that he's talked about for his whole life in Biochemistry what I was trying to explain to Rey is that he was selling everybody a half truth not because he was a fraud it's because he was just ignorant of you know the things that that St Georgie found the things that Becker found and I said dude just elevate your game you're at the end of your life you're at the end of your career but you know kind of I am

01:52:20	too and I didn't learn this in medical school either but this is the path we need to go and you got a lot of young guys like you following you know thinking that eating Oreo cookies and and uh drinking orange juice and drinking milk is the way to go I'm like that's not the way to go we got that just the same way we got all the bad ideas from Dawkins and the reason we got the bad ideas from you know the Jesuits and the Catholic Church the reason we got the bad ideas from The Rockefellers and rilds and banking like a Hal truth

01:52:53	always leads to a full lie when you have the decentralized network perspective and I just fundamentally believe that when you want to come at things from first principles and you're shown a new first principle absorb it into your Lexicon adapt evolve and then sit down and then regurgitate to the masses and show them why You' changed your beliefs at the end of the year I think the problem is When people's paychecks become dependent on them not adopting the new yeah that you do get this entrenchment you get you know the fific

01:53:33	fific the the resistance that was going against Blue Light computers you brought up earlier the entrenched interest try to squash the up andc comers I it seems like a perennial problem that we're always going to be dealing with but we can decentralize the more we can accelerate that well I can tell you I think if we decentralize ourselves like what we been talking about all day today has been the science I think when you realize that we are more decentralized or we become more decentralized in the way we think that

01:54:04	then there's going to be companies that have to cater to us as decentralized humans yeah I think right now we're all too centralized yeah I think you know your Apple computer in front of you sure it has issues you know our clothing where we are now the fact that we're sitting here we got you know Nikon and and Canon cameras all around us the Industrial Age was kind of like an age of centralization in a way right it was but it it's kind of like the way I look at it it's like the way chlorophyll was

01:54:30	before hemoglobin in other words that's as good as we had then because we didn't know better yeah so again on my sliding scale that I like to use with people ignorance versus fraud my position is I think for us as decentralized humans we're the ignorant silly talking monkeys but I think the fraudulent part is the guys that have taken advantage of this because they know it yeah and that's we have to demand of them yeah better products and the way we do that is we don't buy them I like for example you're

01:55:03	in my house now you see my house has no walls we need to demand that they build houses that bring the outside in and you know the inside out in other words we don't spend our hard for it decentralized money until they give us what we want yeah and if we make the mistake can say well I want you know a Tesla truck that's indestructible but it blocks all these lights and it uses EV I don't know if we're sending the right message yeah so if we go back to that coin that has energy and information on one side and entropy on

01:55:42	the other is it because we're moving information around more seamlessly in the digital age that it's leading to this reorganization this social reorganization of decentralization I actually think we're getting less ignorant I I this is what I say to you when we Harvest more information yeah but it's coming at the cost of dealing with these devices that are giving us em notf but you're losing energy see that goes back to your we're losing ignorance but we're getting a new no you're you're becoming wiser but

01:56:16	you're losing time so remember I want to bring you back to what I said to you about the Bitcoin Prague talk why did I go there and be agan provocator because believe it or not Robert I was speaking to guys like you I mean I want to make sure that you become a billionaire when you're my age 60 65 70 years old but I want to make sure that you're not like Steve Jobs halny or Paul Allen that you have $9 billion in the bank and your son has to go visit you by talking to a tombstone yeah so what am I trying to say to you

01:56:52	about this coin understand that there's two sides to this coin and those two sides are like the sword they open the door to heaven and hell you can actually make the correct decision as a Bitcoin and B you can make the wrong decision as the quantum Mighty contract sure and I want you to realize that you can have your cake and eat it too decentralized let's be very Frank about this I'm not saying that you're going to get off this planet alive and live forever that's I'm I'm not selling you the Aubrey de gry story

01:57:24	what I'm saying to you is I think that you can live to 80 to 100 years old with a lot of money MH and I think you can do it without being Tethered to the sausage grinder that centralized medicine you won't have to take any drugs any antibiotics I mean I I want to tell you story and Shantel she's in the room so she can back this up I did a podcast on about a year ago and I had to do some homework for it and I found out that the average American is on 12 different medications by the time they're 50 years old that's the average

01:58:00	in the United States now that's a great business model and the thing is I want to see bitcoiners go in the future where they can live their life Sovereign do whatever they want like if you want to come out here and run around naked in my backyard drink some wine with me and just talk about the things that you want to talk about we can do that I just don't want you to have to spend more money on drugs and supplements than you do on food and I don't think that's too much to ask from yeah from our medical

01:58:31	system and I do believe that it's my duty to teach people that it's possible to do that yeah because it goes back to what I said to you guys last night when we had the discussion offline if not me who yeah and who gave me that idea was Rick rubben Rick said he goes Jack he goes you think that every body thinks like you he goes Nobody thinks like you he goes you the way you think about time the way you think about entropy he goes it's different and it makes you really different when you're a doctor because he goes I've gone to

01:59:06	doctors and he goes That's why I consult you last he goes I want to tell you everything they've told me yeah and then you tell me where the holes are yeah and I think about that when I learned that I thought that was really unfortunate and I think it's unfortunate like I have two ways of doing it I can pump my ego up and say oh this is a great thing I'm doing good things or maybe I can change the system so that never happens so that your kids their grandkids and you know my grandkids and the future of manity

01:59:40	doesn't have to deal with that [ __ ] anymore yeah let me so I've heard you say something about supplements like if your body makes it don't take it yeah uh but you also said that dyum depleted water was the supplement this is a bottle of it here which you said oh I would tell you the ultimate supplement is sunlight sunlight okay you said $30 a bottle dyum depleted water is not cheap can you talk about what is dyum what is dyum depleted water and what is the relationship um what does it have to do

02:00:11	with defeating cancer in humans yeah well this one is pretty simple I guess it's related to photosynthesis as well well it's in everything but I mean I will tell you that the detan story is probably the easiest thing to discuss um but probably to really parse it out to understand it you have to know a lot of physics but remember I told you before duum is a proton and a neutron so it's double the atomic mass right so thermodynamically if you compare that to hydrogen which is just the proton same

02:00:40	charge double the mass right so then it goes straight to eal M c^2 so do you want a lot of dyum in your body or not the answer is no right now it's unnecessary Mass right and if you have unnecessary Mass what does physics say about that that slows time down so or I should say speeds it up so the the real duns up dunks up the mitochondrial processing well yeah because what is the proton channel in the atpa it's built for light hydrogen so like when you open up a biochemistry book like doctors who

02:01:12	are listening to this is going to know this immediately they never ask the question when you look at all the glycolytic pathways they have like nine different enzymatic steps there's all these crazy things from you know that that go on no one ever asked the question of the biochemistry at the front of the room why do we do all this the answer is to get light hydrogen like we take off in our mitochondria in this process we are removing the light hydrogen and leaving the dyum behind so what gets processed

02:01:45	on the inner mitochondrial membrane electron transport is we are racist for the hydrogen we have why is that the case the water that comes out of our top has about 150 parts per million of dyum in it the water that a might Andria makes is like the water that I gave you before this podcast started this is only got 10 to 20 parts so the reason why I call this a supplement most people that are watching this podcast they don't need to have dyum depleted water uh the people that have mitochondrial diseases

02:02:20	which of most chronic diseases are uh those are the people that will have to pay up for them that's the real reason he own Bitcoin because big Pharma the Rockefeller Foundation they're they're never going to tell you about duum depleted water the story you heard before we filmed about Mark Peters the guy with Pro uh pancreatic cancer was given two weeks to live at aser he was told to go home and die this is a Doctor Who's a CEO of a hospital and he says to Shantel I would like to get an extra four months of my life the doctors at as

02:02:56	the oncologist told me to go home and die and Shantel said go talk to Jack he comes to talk to me and he says Jack I don't believe anything anything you and I have talked about today Robert he was as centralized as [ __ ] he made all his money being a CO and a doctor doing the things he did but yet he gets hit with his own Boomerang and um I'll never forget the day I had this discussion he had sunglasses on he was eating a PoBoy remember that see shantel's laughing and I said to him he said to me he goes Jack

02:03:31	this is what I want I want to see my son graduate in three or four months he goes they told me I have two weeks left to live and I said to him I said are you ready to unlearn to relearn and he looked at me very unusual I said I'm going to give you a case of duum depleted water I'm going to give you this red light want you to use it this way gave him his prescription told him what I want him to do I said I do not want to hear you ask me one [ __ ] question you do what I tell you to do just as a lion knows what to do in

02:04:06	Africa and I said if you do that I think I can get you to where your goal is so Robert he gets to his goal and then he lives an extra two months in the extra two months we casually go and see him or three months Shantel say said he got extra 3 months he came to me and said what if I would have believed that you aren't full of [ __ ] and a quack I said then I would have showed you another reality that decentralized networks really do work I would have taught you about mitochondria I would have subtracted out

02:04:45	the RNA and DNA story I would have told you that your cancer is not a function of bad genes it's a function of a that environment tied to the light choices that you made I said you sat in front of a computer the last 20 years of your life I said that's the reason you got pancreatic cancer I said that's the reason you're going to die and he said do you really believe that I could have reversed this I said yeah I said you want to know the truth I said you told me something in the beginning of this you need to hear

02:05:18	this he becomes a type 2 diabetic before he gets pancreatic cancer why from the blue light from the computer screen I said did you ever notice something that's really funny when you got pancreatic cancer were you diabetic anymore he goes no I said so you cured your diabetes with cancer I said did you ever think that maybe your CS were trying to tell you that this was all about timing and entropy and I sat him down and saw her explain it to him he said so let me get this straight you actually through this

02:05:51	Water and Light were able to tell how my gut clocks could yoke up better with the clocks of my eye but I was so far gone that you were able to give me more time at the end of my life I said W you're waking up I said just imagine if you would have come to me 20 years ago before you ever got the metabolic disturbance from the blue light in the screens I said if you want to know the truth Sergey Brin and his friends in Silicon Valley and the people in MK Ultra and the irony was remember this is a doctor from New

02:06:25	Orleans um he knew about the stories about Asher in the basement but guess what this points out one of the really powerful stories of humanity you can be right next to the right answer and still miss it yeah you can even have the right answer in the wrong time that's it timing matters yeah and what does physics teach us about timing physics tell us that timing determines how energy flows over matter yeah and like this is aaic every physicist knows it but I don't think that any MD realizes just how important timing is to our

02:07:04	biology circadian timing is everything it's actually every chronic disease you name the chronic disease and I'm going to tell you the answer is a circadian clock mechanism right the only diseases that aren't are the true genetic diseases that would be like um cystic fibrosis TX disease disease things like that but for example diseases like Parkinson and Alzheimer's uh heart disease high blood pressure type one type two diabetes they're all circadian mismatches so it's cellular when the cellular system is out of

02:07:39	synchronization you get pathologies just like when an economy is out of synchronization through money printing or whatever it gets problems it's exactly the same you just absolutely nailed why diseases are not being solved and why our economic problems aren't being solved and if you think about what Malay just did in Argentina it really will get you thinking because he just went in and got rid of all his chronic diseases by just shrinking government yeah I wish I could do that in cancer like going and cut all your clocks out

02:08:11	that are bad I can't do that but guess what this little supplement you asked me about can resynchronize some of the clocks where your bad problem so that's what duum depleted water's doing synchronizing the system and that's why I decided to use this analogy of Mark and Mark Peters with you because I think instead of getting into the esoteric stuff about how mitochondria functionally work and what dyum is really doing I think when you hear a story about time and a person that has the second most virin cancer to GBM that

02:08:47	can take you out really fast if a crazy doctor can tell you that I can give you time back that the centralized doctors said and here's the crazy part of the story robber how much did it cost Mark Peters to get the six or seven months back zero you know why Shantel bought him the water she did that to prove to him I gave him one of the lights out of my clinic so he didn't have to pay for that but we gave him the most valuable asset in his life and he got to see his son graduate yeah and all it cost him was curiosity all it

02:09:31	cost him was sitting down and talking to the Quack and then he had the experience that maybe this guy isn't such a quack maybe maybe I need to listen to what he's saying and beautiful well I mean I'll just tell you I think there's a lesson here for everybody like stay curious that's it right and never have the final answer and always treat knowledge as provisional as you said yet as you said previously taking a list annually of all the things you think you know and asking yourself if you still know them one by

02:10:05	one well I said to your buddy the other day and before you came I mean I think this is the most apropo place to use this cliche that I like to use the truth is an approximation of what we currently believe so that means the truth is never absolute right so guess what I just said to you not only is time relative but so is the truth yeah but not totally right because isn't Bitcoin something that it's like this absolute you what happens if quantum Computing comes by then even then the center of even mathematics you

02:10:33	don't want to go to bitcoin like the number zero there is we do have these representations of the absolute that we really need to cohere around because if you make truth just relativistic well then it's my truth and your truth and you get into all this kind of wced nonsense yeah but I I will tell you that I don't think I'm going to be honest you I push back on you in this I don't think there's any absolute truth I think there's truth that's discoverable that's bigger than us I think we plug in to

02:11:00	decentralize networks that's our truth yeah I would tell you that our truth is nature we you and I everybody listen to this podcast we're designed to plug in right outside there is there an absolute aspect to Nature is there a part of nature light water magnetism okay and guess what it turns out that why isn't that even absolute because of the story I just told you about Mark and usin both why Mark didn't live on a volcano Mark wasn't wasn't Jamaican he didn't have the melanation to affect him like a guy

02:11:36	like Usain Bolt with dark skin he probably would have stayed a type two diabetic his whole life and not got pancreatic cancer yeah but Mark got the pancreatic cancer and Mark never had the the the thought in his head yeah why is it when I got cancer my diabetes went away you would have thought a doctor would have asked that question but he didn't why because all the things that he was taught in the medical school curriculum was put there by the Rockefeller Foundation from Big Pharma and that began with the flexing report

02:12:05	in 1911 so if you want to know the reason why I'm a prick online the reason why I go after people is because we've got to fix this problem just like you are a Savage for Bitcoin and you want to use knowledge and WI wisdom to get people to understand Bitcoin I'm trying to do the same thing to let people know that decentralized health and wealth are linked yeah and they're linked fundamentally because I want to see the Savages in Bitcoin live a full and healthy life without me I want you to subtract Uncle

02:12:43	Jack well we're learning a lot through Uncle Jack and if I may try to put a button on this section if nature is looking at nature as God in a way that maybe that light water and magnetism are the trinitarian formula of nature as God it's an interesting interesting way I've never thought about that funny thing is I've written a Blog called The Holy Trinity um but I like it I'm not going to say that I don't like it I just think if I can get people to worship nature the way they worship technology will be a lot better than we

02:13:20	are that's really my goal before I get off this planet I want to do this USB download that you and I are doing hopefully a lot of people will listen to this podcast and go you know there's some truth here there's some things here that I need to take Jack more seriously so it's the mark of an educated mind to take something you don't believe examine it for yourself so I want everybody out there who's a Savage who's decentralized to not believe anything Uncle Jack tell told you I want you examine it all come back

02:13:53	and Trust verify right I want you to come back and tell me that I'm wrong cuz you know what I am very open to the possibility of being wrong we're going to get into some books I think when we pick this conversation back up are there any sources you want to Rattle off right now for people that you want to push into those rabbit holes yeah I would tell you the first book the book on light that I think you should start with is Roland van Wick's book called light sculpting life uh the book on water that's basic but it gives you a

02:14:24	third grade understanding it's not fully accurate is Gerald Pollock's book that you had the [[Exclusion Zone Water|fourth phase of water]] the reason Jerry's book is not definitive is because he didn't do any of his studies with UV light and he didn't do any of his studies with duum depleted water that was a mistake uh but it's still a good book for you to read the book about non-native [[Non-Native Electromagnetic Fields|EMF]] all the things that you hear me talking about both blue light non-native [[Non-Native Electromagnetic Fields|EMF]] Andre Marino's book called going somewhere it's a textbook

02:14:55	on the work of of [[Robert O Becker|Robert Becker]] not only that you'll be able to read the testimony from US Congress to know from 1973 to 77 how much of this information was already discoverable yet you still have people making these computers to hurt you I mean I look at this computer just the way you look at a covid Mr vaccine the only difference is the vaccine will kill you faster than this world this will kill you like it killed Mark Peters right and I think um a book for the simpletons uh John a health and light

02:15:29	spectacular book you can read it I think in a day it teaches you the very Basics about why you need to question light um Nick Lane's book anything Nick Lane is written you want to learn about mitochondria uh my favorite book that he's written is uh Power sex and suicide very cool title but the book is spectacular um he's got another one called the vital question Jim L K's book life at the edge spectacular for those who are the Skeptics that think that there's no Quantum processing in US he'll teach you about the European Robin

02:16:10	and the cryptone protein in it how they magnetically navigate all over the planet spectacular book yeah bird see magnetic lines exactly and believe it or not since Birds you now know come from dinosaurs and we have remnants in us that means that we have remnants in in us as well and we're able to to do the same things but there's so many different books out there are important I think some of the the people that I've referenced do I believe that you need to read a little bit about the story of Albert St Georgie should you read The

02:16:48	Body Electric by by Robert o Becker yes should you read cross Curr by Robert o Becker yes should you read everything that Becker's written my opinion yes um are there other people out there that have written books that are important there are but we're talking about the beginnings like if you're going to go out and buy some books for people for Christmas the books that I just gave to you is the perfect starter pack for a bitcoiner okay beautiful you said something to me yesterday that we are little mammals living in a big

02:17:28	T-Rex World um what is what did you mean by that is this related to you've grown up the KT event yeah we've grown up so what is think about it at my pool today you saw the black bird the black bird used to be the T-Rex and now you and I used to be the small little mammal that lived under the ground that was furry take a look at us look at the difference we're not hairy like they were but we have big brains big immune systems big hearts we now live longer than any other mammal on the planet after 65 million years it's kind of

02:18:07	pretty cool upgrade when you actually think about it and when you think about the T-Rex when you go into the museum of natural history in New York you see that monster you see that skull and now it's the bird that was drinking water yeah out of my pool you go how'd that happen yeah how did that happen so it's I'm gonna tell you it happened from one jean jean that we talked about okay the pomy Jean ah that was what I spent 10 hours trying to explain to uberman on Rick's podcast and pomy sculpt like when you

02:18:47	asked me earlier today about tell me the books Jack and I told you about Roland van Wick's book about life sculpts life what you'll find in that book is actually how light does it but it doesn't talk about paly paly you have to know the evolutionary story you have to be a little bit of an evolutionary biologist you have to know a little bit about Kevin mcan's work when he worked with Craig ventner on the Human Genome Project why the beliefs that we had about 100,000 genes was false MH when it turned out we only had two 300 genes

02:19:23	more than chimps and gorillas so we had to asked the question the hard question the question that nobody in biology wanteded to ask because of the beliefs that Dawkins Darwin even Lamar put in us how can we be so similar but yet so different and it turns out that one gene can sculped us and it sculpt us because that Gene is only turned on by the accent on the E of the electromagnetic spectrum that you asked me about it turns out that that one gene is a very small part of this story so if you remember earlier in the podcast we

02:20:08	talked about tunable parts of the electromagnetic spectrum turns out the Palm SE story that I try to relate to Rick and uberman however successful unsuccessful it is Rick would probably tell you it was successful because the podcast was a big hit but that Gene sculpted us from the small mountains okay and when you look at us we clearly look different than what we came from but it's also the coraly that birds look radically different than a T-Rex in fact I would say their change is probably bigger

02:20:50	probably from a morphogenetic standpoint M because their body type has changed but the interesting thing that links us is the hip joint the fact that they had feathers they still used almost every single system that we did but their environment 65 million years ago 70 M million years ago was different and the interesting part of the story so you are how shall we say timeline perspective because we've been talking a lot about time in this whole series is mammals evolve 300 million years ago so we're only talking 65 million years ago

02:21:37	so if you look at that peock yeah pretty small period of time but it's the most impactful part because this is when mammals take over the world yes this is when dinosaurs retract no intended right so how was the KT event figuratively and literally so impactful on mallan biology this is I don't know how you're going to feel about this I probably like to get your feedback because I don't know where you are you've not shared with me or the audience yet where you are on the food and light story so this is where I would

02:22:12	tell you Uncle Jack really puts the food gurus to shame because it turns out when the asteroid hits the planet we've got 30 miles of dirt up in the air we've got the idium band everywhere in the world we know it's from pole to pole there's no place on Earth where that band's not there so it blocks photosynthesis so it blocks light so if it blocks light is it lighter food and it turns out the two mammals that make it through that KT event are euan mammals those are mammals that have a placenta what's important

02:22:49	about the placenta something that you asked me a lot about today letin letin controls fecundity it controls fertility and what's the other side of it turns out it's birds birds are theropod dinosaurs they're dinosaurs that fly you know as a little boy you learn you know T-Rexes didn't fly but the arch opter is the first dinosaur that we knew that flew and therapod dinosaurs are the ancestor of the therapod dinosaur and therapod dinosaurs are actually where Modern birds come from so when you actually tell your child hey look that

02:23:31	really is a T-Rex because that's what I tell people on my pool all the time when they come drink water four o'clock that that's really what's happened in the last 65 million years and it really happened because light on Earth changed because dirt from an asteroid blocked light for some period of time the argument we don't know yeah I would tell you that we have no earthly idea how long the block was in Rick's podcast my prediction was it wasn't as long as we all think I think that was a shorter period of time and if you

02:24:09	remember I brought up the the bioh hack that I did with the black lady that had Vitiligo that I was able to repigment her skin in a couple of months because we can use and move it when we have the appropriate stimulus there I think the same thing was true with the original small mammals we were and the big T-Rexes and what happened we switched places so the stable energy source that was the Sun that was dependent for photosynthesis and energizing the food chain all the way up to the T-Rex that energy source

02:24:43	was interrupted via This Global blockage Cloud right this would be like this would be like for bitcoiners to understand this would be like a CM 1859 caran event coming knocking out the power grid like as we said before 133% of bitcoin's networks under theground it's protected we wouldn't have to replace that we would have to recapitulate the hole from that that's actually what life did so what is an Extinction event when you think about it like this Extinction event is when either energy or information is taken

02:25:14	away from the system you've gone through five of them I submit to you that were currently 125 years in the sixth one right now there's people out there like Elizabeth Colbert who's written a book about the sixth Extinction M that's ongoing she doesn't have the same perspective I do I believe the sixth Extinction started in 1893 with Tesla's AC power grid and everything that we plug into it actually is our asteroid why because it does the same thing because the thing in front of you right now that Apple computer that's your

02:25:47	asteroid that changes the light that you're adapted to so dinosaurs and their food chain get disrupted by this event this KT event this because they're the carnivores of the day this now present big huge animals that need massive but they depend on big plants feeding big herbivores feeding big carnivores and that whole chain is interrupted gone it's like gone like this then mammals then are able to rise because we can generate light internally is that here's where where is the leptin Milano courton

02:26:20	pathway and Palm Sea coming into the story of Mamon the first thing that happens is once the Dinosaurs the big PR is taken away the little mammals can come out from underneath the ground remember they lived under the ground right N9 10 months out of the year to avoid predation correct that was the original issue and that's the reason why we got placentas remember eutherian mammals mean they're they have placentas okay the only mammo that gets through the KT event that you know about is like the duck bill platypus like the ducks

02:26:53	that actually still lay eggs but everybody else is taken out that's laying eggs including the dinosaurs right but what becomes a dominant mammal because if you can keep your young internally inside you create your own environment so it immediately asked the question well how is that possible like if you've interrupted the Sun and that's where I brought you in Rick's podcast okay let's talk about pom SE let's talk about the parts of palom SE let's talk about Act turns out the food gurs the guys that you know

02:27:25	that I pound on all the time they're always telling you that the only way you can make glucoses of V carbohydrates and Oreo cookies and bad [ __ ] turns out they're wrong turns out act rages your blood sugar so what does that mean means light creates sugar you don't need you asked me a question earlier today Jack do we do animal photosynthesis now I just told you a second way we do it it's not just through splitting electrons through melanin now you're realizing oh [ __ ] there's a part of pomy that creates

02:27:58	act which is adrenocorticotropin hormone which eventually makes the hormone you know about cortisol cortisol when you inject it into your veins makes blood sugar so that means that you can create energy from Blue Light well guess what happens when you block most of sunlight with an asteroid you lock out and block out a lot of infrared a near infrared and UV but guess what you don't block out blue so blue light is now predominant in the atmosphere for however long time it is because we don't know the time frame

02:28:36	and these little mammals come out and what happens they're able to persist because they can make glucose in their body without any food being around because what's the dominant light now it's now different type of Sun than what they've been adopted to but it turns out they have the tool in their tool bag to do this who doesn't the Dinosaurs the dinosaurs need the sun they need the food chains that the carnivores that you follow need and the problem is people don't realize what I'm trying to teach people is you don't

02:29:17	need that and you don't realize that that nuclear weapon that superpower that was in mammals is still in us today and now we've created an environment that is a new asteroid that's technology that actually is driving this process when we're no longer a little Manimal and that destroys Palm SE signaling us and leads to all the chronic diseases that we have today so Palm SE was the thing that sculpted us and made us what we are and now we we're interrupting that signaling pathway correct that's the pathology what okay

02:30:00	this is a bit of a pivot but at one point in one of your podcasts you said you were really fascinated with the periodic table when you were a child totally um I want you to expand upon that and can you work in Walter Russell's version of the periodic table that's it's not the rectangular Square version it's the one that spiral it's the spiral yeah shows different elements as different octaves and vibrational patterns like what is that accurate what are what are your thoughts about the periodic table and I wouldn't I wouldn't

02:30:29	say it's accurate or inaccurate I would tell you it's a perspective that Russell had that's tied to size and shape so if I paint the picture for you to try for you to understand melev's periodic table versus Russell's this is what I would tell you M's periodic table made predictions about where atoms should be found based on thermodynamics based on electrons protons and energy it was really based on the laws of thermodynamics but here's the interesting part Russell's idea of the periodic table on the spiral he was more

02:31:09	thinking like Tesla was about vibration and frequency and it turns out just like everything else that I've told you Mel and Russell are like the supplement makers they like the food GS it's a half truth okay so you have to realize the part that they got right that's what we should focus in on so you guys asked me a question earlier about Terrence Howard and Eric Weinstein in the podcast he do at Rogan and I told you you have to take away the Nugget that's there and then leave behind what's not this is what

02:31:42	bitcoiners have to be good at because the Via negativa you have to subtract out the pseud signs but bring in so what I want you to focus in on when I tell you that I hacked the periodic table not only did I hack it from Mendel's ideas about how the table is organized into periods and tables but also knowing Walter Russell's spiral that frequencies mattered you remember earlier today when we talked a little bit about Ray Pete and why I had a problem with Ray Pete when I presented to him and said I want you to know about

02:32:21	absorption and emission Spectre absorption and emission Spectre is a synonym for Vi for vibration and frequency but someone who's a biochemist doesn't understand what I just said to you you know that's like you speaking Mandarin Chinese and me coming in talking sesan and what I'm trying to say to you is menel and Russell were talking the same language but different dialects of that right exactly and the reason a disunity between biology and physics well there's a huge disunity I mean we've talked

02:32:55	about that earlier today when we talked about science but I would tell you within science we actually talked about the problems I have in physics I've told you about some of the problems I have in biology you know when we talked about the randomized control clinical trial but what we're talking about now is a very fundamental level why because these are the elements of the periodic table Yeah and the way in which you approach the elements of the periodic table is very very different so what did I do

02:33:24	when I hacked the periodic table to figure out the things that I figured out from a Quantum biologic perspective I was looking for a trend that actually made biology special and the two things that I came up with this is the part from Walter Russell's periodic table frequency and vibration but the real big one absorption and Mission Spectra MH and then it came down to looking at what atoms were affected by a magnetic field and ones Warren and that was the real come to Jesus moment because I found out that atoms that were

02:34:05	affected by magnetic fields they were called special name paramagnetic and what did I find most of the atoms that we use in biology are paramagnetic and what's the one one gas cuz you asked me this multiple times toight I never went this step with you until now uh in 2014 I gave a a really provocative talk at uh Pasadena Coliseum with Dave asri in one of his bulletproof conferences and he put me in a small little room to keep my science tight because he didn't want this information getting out because he

02:34:47	wanted to keep it on food and the stuff that he sold oxygen is paramagnetic what does that mean it's the only gas on the periodic table that reacts to magnetic fields why is that important well you know that oxygen is the terminal electron acceptor for mitochondria and you know that right in front of that terminal electron acceptor is the fo head that spins that's on the electron chain that's the wire what is the fo head the fo head is part of the ATP a that spins okay and it spins 9,000 times per second okay every

02:35:23	time it spins three and 1 half turns a proton goes through and you make ATP okay why is that important anything that spins and has an electric current go through it 1850s Michael Faraday tells you it makes a magnetic field guess why oxygen why do we breathe it's an electromagnetic event and that's why oxygen was picked and why we didn't pick carbon why we didn't pick fluoride or chlorine or chlorine turns out that oxygen is the only gas on the on the periodic table that's paramagnetic and electronegative so it made it the

02:36:03	ideal terminal electronic sceptor for Mighty cond now did we use oxygen in the beginning of Life you know we talked earlier today about 3.8 billion years ago about bacteria ARA back then that wasn't the dominant gas in the atmosphere dominant gas was something completely different that's why different bacteria like methanogens used different gases like methane to make their energy they actually use CO2 and hydrogen and protons to generate energy but we don't do that anymore but do we have remnants

02:36:40	in us like some of the free radicals that are using us that are called gasotransmitters that's things that you've heard of when you're a young boy you know that when eggs get rotten they smell like rotten eggs that's a hydrogen sulfide gas believe it or not that gas is actually made even in humans to this very day yeah so where would you see that is if you're a doctor like I am somebody drowns in a pool it's cold water wouldn't happen in Miami but let's say it's in Minnesota that person can be under the water for 45 minutes we would

02:37:12	still do CPR on that person when they come in because we know that there's a chance they could live because they can use these gasotransmitters what's another one that you heard of carbon monoxide what's another one carbon dioxide you can use these gases as a terminal electronic scepter one of the other gases you've probably heard about nitric oxide nitric oxide is used to lower our blood pressure believe it or not we in our previous evolutionary history could use these gases to run mitochondrial biology was it as

02:37:44	efficient it's very similar to the story that you asked me earlier about chlorophyll hemoglobin and melanin turns out these gases are more like chlorophyll they weren't as effective of pulling energy and information from light for us to make energy but when we were single cell or small multicellular organisms yeah we could do it but we still have that ability in us from billions of years ago because we are a fractal of what those first two domains are and this is what makes life amazing when you understand this let me ask you

02:38:23	the terminal electron acceptor that oxygen was providing for the mitochondria to capture the electron so the mitochondria is generating this energy and then oxygen is carrying theer the the atpa which is the four cytochrome has a spinning head and it's also what makes water called cytochrome SE oxidase so it's a very powerful is this the Nano engine yeah it's a Quantum Nano engine that works with 100% efficiency like when I say the word always never or 100% everybody who's a Bitcoin in the audience needs to go

02:39:03	[ __ ] go look it up you can put it in you know a Yandex or Google box right now and you'll find out that the studies have already been done to prove what I'm telling you is true 100% efficiency how there's no loss to friction no l zero dude you don't ask questions like that on a podcast why this is where I I enact finin don't ever ask nature questions she has figured out over 3.8 billion years in her how shall we say laboratory yeah we've never built an engine ever like the atpa and it turns out the atpa

02:39:40	is in everything of life there's nothing that exists that doesn't have the atpa therefore hither to and moreover this is when you bend gen you flect at the knee and go this is pretty special stuff but do you need to ask questions of like what does the atpa do well guess what its favorite type of light is red light yeah and it works with nitric oxide in fact nitric oxide inhibits ATP production it stops electron Train transport it reduces ATP so this is when you go so Jack is this how nitric oxide

02:40:18	can save somebody that's in water drowning who can't breathe the answer is yes now I'm going to do a hard stop with you when we talked about the story of dinosaurs and mammals remember what I told you when you inside your mama you were inside a water-filled sack too right called the womb with amnionic fluid around you weren't you there not that long ago how old are you Robert 39 almost all right so 39 years ago you were that organism inside your mother and you had those abilities in you and you were using them

02:40:54	until the doctor slapped you on the ass and you started to breathe oxygen so why do you retain this issue it turns out because you're a mammal because you came from a womb MH and this ability is still built into you but what makes the atpa special that fo head rotates every 3.4 turns a proton goes through you make ATP but when anything spins and an electric current goes through it which is what electron Train Transport is Faraday says it makes a magnetic field that means that gases that are paramagnetic will be

02:41:34	drawn to it so why do we really breathe many people like my friend Erin Lor from movat will tell you well we breathe for a very specific purpose that purpose is this one it's an electromagnetic ability but we didn't always breathe oxygen and you have to realize that we retain those abilities but now that the environment that you and I live in is very high in oxygen 21% so we've adapted you got it so guess what we are now life forms as I said in Rick's podcast million we're we're we're not 1.1 where we're like Bitcoin

02:42:16	evolved 3.8 billion years right version 3.8 right it's it's crazy when you actually think about the time scales but I want you to realize that the evidence the blockchain that's in US is these gases that are gasotransmitters got it we actually can survive a drowning and cold water because we use these abilities when oxygen is no longer available to us that's the reason why we just don't do codes on people when they come in h wow uh okay you in addition to the books you recommended earlier before when I was

02:42:54	preparing for this podcast you had recommended a number of books to me um some of them I wanted to just ask you questions about because a lot of them have very radical viewpoints uh one of them is titled cells gels and the engines of Life yeah that's by Pollock poock and so he's talking about I he's basically taking arguing that our traditional metaphor for cells is like little liquid filled bags is not correct that they're more like gel flexible gel-like structures Liquid Crystal and structures liquid we talked that earlier

02:43:28	and so and the and water obviously plays a very active role in the mechanics of Life uh maybe this pertains to the [[Exclusion Zone Water|fourth phase of water]] as well because you just well remember that book that you just quoted is a predecessor to this book same author right so you have to realize what is he doing he's actually giving you his evolution of thinking okay so the point that he tried to make in that book that book was really written to try to explain all the things that Gilbert Ling came up with and we talked about Gilbert Ling earlier

02:44:01	brilliant guy most of Gilbert's books if you read them even today and I would tell you I'm a pretty smart guy these are the most difficult books you'll ever read so for you to understand it you have to get where he's going so why did Pollock write this book he was trying to explain how muscles worked and the way Pollock decided to come to this story is that muscles were liquid crystallin all the actin and protein and mein that's in all worked as a gel but it only worked with water and why did he

02:44:36	make this key point because when you look at a biochemistry book a centralized biochemistry book you open it up and you see all these Pathways Pathways that you know from the food gurus that you follow they talk about glycolysis they they talk about gluconeogenesis they talk about the [[TCA Cycle]] but you know what's interesting about all the Cycles they never talk about what water is doing and all this and it turns out in a Cell every single protein in a cell is surrounded by water and if you remember our early discussion

02:45:05	I told you that anything that's coded for by DNA or RNA is a protein semiconductor yeah but it doesn't work without water but the number one dominant thing that we all believe today in medicine is that biochemistry is accurate and what do they do they homogenize a cell take the water out and just look at the proteins behind and think they can explain life okay and then they come out to Robert Breedlove and say Robert this is what you should do and we believe this and you never have an earthly idea

02:45:38	to say to them well what about the water you just took out of the V mix blender right and see that's what someone like Dr Alexis cow that I told you about who trained at the best metabolic lab in the world she's like well not only are we not studying the water with the biochemistry but we're not even talking about the light that controls the water the biochemistry and the water so how about we add both of them back in so I'm going to tell you from Pollock's book that you mentioned that's a book that

02:46:13	only has onethird of the story right so if you read that book and think you're reading the truth that like reading David Sinclair and his opinion about NAD supplementation it's total [ __ ] it's propaganda it's marketing you need to subtract it now it doesn't mean there's not benefit to reading the book but when you read this book on top of that book you go okay you just gave me another layer to the onion to under understand the story because what are we trying to get Robert breed love to understand how

02:46:44	are the semiconductors built in us how do they really work how do you get me from l poock to Becker because you read Becker's book which is this book next to you and Becker told you there was semiconduction he backed it up and he did Exquisite experiments to show it but you need to know as a bitcoiner jack I like what you're telling me I like the science but I need to verify what you're telling me is trusted is it truly decentralized or is this centralized [ __ ] that you're trying to sell me so I buy a supplement

02:47:20	from you and I think you already know about me I don't like supplements why because what do you know about AMD and intel if we add any bad chemicals into a semiconductor Factory don't they have clean rooms yeah so why would we want to put anything into a clean room if we're making semiconduction you understand why when you told me about your supplements and neurot Tropics you you saw Uncle Jacko duum could be in there yeah what I'm trying to do is not get you Robert to believe this story I'm trying to get you at the end

02:47:55	of your year to start to write down all the things you believe and start to question them again because guess what next year we do a podcast like this you're G to say Jack let's have a talk I'm now upgraded where I'm at I begin to realize why your perspective is what it is you explain to me how we went from Pollock's third book to his fourth book how it ties in be book I got it I got the message I understand about clean rooms hopefully you're even beginning to understand why Uncle Jack has a huge problem with the

02:48:28	messenger RNA Jabs why paper was just published in the last four weeks that showed we have 51 atoms in the covid Jabs that we don't even use so when you ask the question and you understand the semiconductive Fab story if we're using carbon based semiconductors and proteins or water what happens when we put aluminum in what happens when we put tantalum in what happens when we put calcium in what happens when we add zinc Jack how does this affect you know what the answer is this goes back to your

02:49:02	sailor series it's the Leaky Hydraulics when the plane is starting to land and guess what then all of a sudden Ramen goes so Jack is that what long Co is the answer is yes Jack is this why people get clots in their brain Jack is this why people get myocarditis so it's mitochondrial getting gunked up then boom see see look you're not the brain surge you're not the scientist but guess what you're getting it catching on so going back to the cells then this structured water is like the fourth phase of water I guess

02:49:36	he calls it that but I'm going to tell you that I think plasma is the real fourth phase that's that's a formation of light water I think we need to take totally out okay and we go back to what we said earlier today when we talked about water goes through a phase transition when light hits it yeah like poock did a really good job in the book which is the same same thing as saying it becomes structured right yeah well when he say structured what he's talking about because remember he's not using precise terminology in this book

02:50:07	crystalline like said ear he's trying to he's trying to make this book you know and I'm sure Jerry will listen to this and get pissed off of me but this book is written for a third grader who doesn't really understand science but that's why it's approachable yeah to the audience that's going to listen to this podcast and I'm still going to tell you is this book something that you should buy for everybody for Christmas the answer is yes why this book being the [[Exclusion Zone Water|fourth phase of water]] yeah start with

02:50:30	this one not cells gels no this is way better book than cells and gels because you'll get lost in that okay this book explains to you really how water fundamentally Works about charge separation and being a battery and when you separate positive from negative charge that's what a battery is we call that a capacitor m and it turns out water is an electromagnetic capacitor my my criticisms of Jerry is he didn't use duum depleted water right to do the studies to show the difference because fundamentally that's the water

02:51:02	mitochondria make and then he also didn't be too specific about the light my opinion is that light in the electromagnetic spectrum even within the visible spectrum like if you go red like now we're going to go to the Pink Floyd album cover M When You See It visible spectrum is broken into seven colors goes from red to purple you know all the colors in between each one of those colors do a different thing to water and it turns out the amount of the EZ that's the term he uses EC stands for exclusion

02:51:36	zone why did he Co that why did he call it that because it excludes protons which is the positive charge what did we talk about earlier if you exclude a proton your charge separating that's how you make a battery yeah that's the quantum battery that you asking me before gotcha all of that in his book those concepts are great but I'm going to tell you red light orange light yellow light green light blue light purple light red light all makes a different size easy in other words the battery is not equivalent with any color

02:52:08	got it and I'm going to tell you the best battery isn't red light I think the best battery is UV light and that's the light that your dermatologist your op oologist told you it's no bueno right yeah but guess what we talked about earlier today we talked about the guy who came up with the idea that everything emits UV light UV biophotons why is it that the question that Pollock should have asked but he didn't this is why I have a problem with him when Fritz pop says everything alive no matter what it is emits extreme lowf

02:52:47	frequency UV light that should immediately stop every scientist in the track who's a water researcher and go why is UV light special because it seems like everything that's alive makes it now we didn't know that until the 1960s and70s when photo multipliers became available well that is the missing chapters in that book so that's the reason why when I tell you I want you to read this but this is where I want you to be the bitcoiner realize what's not in the book like this is like learning or it's like reading safe's

02:53:24	book and missing the last three chapters see what I'm saying and the book is still good but you're like right I need the more when you say every form of life emits UV light and obviously UV is a very broad spectrum right it's everything actually it's a very now Spectrum in the visible well I was going to say but is it beyond the visible like life's admitting you can't see UV light I mean when I say you I mean humans can't see it but guess what insects can my question is dogs can is life emitting ultraviolet light that

02:53:59	is beyond the visible spectrum yes okay and we know that from the photo multiplier story what's the interesting part is we have no earthly idea truly what it's doing because guess what nobody in the NIH is funding research because Dr fouchy has blocked a lot of that and this is where Doug Wallace comes in to play here he says we spend 99% of our money using RNA and DNA research nothing on mitochondrial DNA and where does this light come from your H hitting Becker's book it comes from mitochondrial DNA so

02:54:40	if you're not studying mitochondrial DNA how are you ever going to know about this light got it so we said earlier light structures water or or makes it crystalline I guess to use another ter Liquid Crystal liquid Liquid Crystal what is the role of electrolytes don't electrolytes do something similar for water electrolytes do all different kinds of things but if you know anything about semiconduction they're the dopin so for example you you're pounding right now on the Body Electric that's Becker's

02:55:06	book in Becker's book he tells you about what the dopin is on the semiconductors and Bone what are those two dopin they're Co two copper atoms what is a dopent a dopent is something that's an atom that that changes the photoelectric effect of when light hits a semiconductor changes the light emission okay so if you for example Make it try to make it make it really simple if you take a piece of unpolished silicon and you shine a light through it you will create light that comes out it will be a very spe specific Spectrum okay kind

02:55:44	prism of sorts right if you polish the silicone you'll actually make a different type of light but then on the silicone where there's a crack in it if you put two dopin these are atoms that are not silicon they change the photoelectric properties of the Crystal and guess what happens you make a different frequency of light also not always the frequency change polarization changes what else changes there's many qualities of light that also change and it turns out these things become very important biology why

02:56:24	because remember when we talked about the entropy dump yeah after all of these things are used in biology to do different things and you know what the problem is centralized Medicine centralize Science is not studying any of these things so like when I tell you what they do what I tell you what I think they do they don't know but when somebody puts polarized lenses say from Rayban on their eyes they're they're completely changing everything that goes on distal to their retina in their brain so we should not be doing that until we

02:56:57	know exactly what the effect is in the brain and are there books out there that we mentioned earlier like John ook yeah that actually hint to us that just by wearing polarized lenses it's a problem why because if we were designed to wear polarized lenses wouldn't you think that God or Evolution would make our lens and our eye polarized and it's not turns out that sunlight is completely unpolarized looking at the cells again uh Paul I I want to make one more Point sorry to interrupt you all the light

02:57:33	that's around us right now in this podcast on your computer screen it's all polarized every light that's plugged into a AC power grid is polarized light even these red lights you got it okay so so that's not good correct I thought the red light was good we SP all well but that's this is the point that I'm trying to make to you about quantum mechanics these little changes these Butterfly Effects lead to Collateral effects so the question for you as the bitor and since you're asking the questions of

02:58:02	science what are the effects of this truth be told Robert I can't answer those questions to you because nobody's studying why because Anthony fouchy thinks it's more prudent to study RNA and DNA than mitochondrial DNA so do you understand now why putting J bateria in the NIH and Bobby Kennedy in HHS might be important for the discussion that we're having right now the answer is this is actually how politics could actually affect science because guess what we're doing we're now asking different questions of

02:58:36	centralized science than we did before and generally if you have chronic diseases and you can't answer them what are we saying maybe finding a new path to the answer can bring us a new place bring us a new place that CI and Casey means don't want us to go they want to blame everything on Froot Loops and red die number five you know you know many of the guys that you follow they want to blame it on carbohydrates proteins and fats or seed oils what I'm saying to you what I'm trying to point out to you

02:59:08	there's many other knobs on The Equalizer dial that could actually change this in tremendous ways why because we are much more sensitive to light than people know this isn't just about it's all Downstream from light you got it okay so the cells themselves Pollock's arguing that they actually have a cytoskeleton which is something like a flexible it's like your bones just think about it so you understand it so cells have skeletons yeah well it's made out of colllege okay collagen is the tens gritty part of the system remember Buck

02:59:46	Miner Fuller you and I talked about him earlier yeah Buckminster Fuller made the geodisc Dome you know about that you've seen it many many times uh I'm not sure what is that's the Dome that has all the triangles on it that is structurally extremely strong oh okay sure turns out that's what actin is in the muscles that you talked about Pollock's other book the other thing is when you see uh chromosomes they're together when the daughter cells split apart centrosomes pull apart what pulls it apart those are

03:00:14	microtubules microtubules are part of actually the tgy system in there what's the most common protein in all cells collagen you know that you probably know that from bone broth and you know the bone broth is good you probably have no idea why it is but that's the base chemical of the electric power grid in the cell so when you think about this like a Bitcoin you're like how good would we do without an electric power grid in Bitcoin not too good well the same thing is turns out with cells if you ruin the electric power grid in

03:00:48	cells which is formed by collagen which is a triple helix when you compress collagen it's p Electric it's flexo electric what does that mean it creates electricity when we deform it that's everything that you learned about in Becker's book Becker told you that collagen is one of the semiconductors that's in bone okay well it turns out collagen's not just in bone it's in your ligaments it's in almost every part of your body there is no part no organ your skin your brain your kidneys your arteries it's [ __ ] everywhere

03:01:26	the electrical Grid at the cellular level you got it wow that's what the tens gridy system is so the the cytoskeleton of the cell is the actual electrical grid yeah it's I I would like you to think about it like Con Edison or I don't know what the name of the grid is in Florida whoever runs an energy maybe FPL yeah there you go you call it whatever state you're in yeah got it okay uh okay so what does this have to do all right Pollock made this this interesting argument that ties to something we were

03:01:55	talking about earlier perhaps suggesting that cellular structures can send vibrations and waves through these gel-like structures those are called solons just so you know and that allows for like a nearly instantaneous communication across long distances correct so add solons have a very unique ability in physics that they can remember when we talked about photons earlier and I told you that photons are the force sheny of the electromagnetic force when light hits a protein or anything else it can

03:02:24	create electromechanical vibration that is another synonym for a Solon which is what Pollock is talking about there a Solon has very specific abilities it can continue information transfer infinum so it turns out that when you change light into a sound wave an Electro mechanical wave this can be transmitted over vast distances this that and that's what I want to ask about because this sounds like quantum entanglement to me this sounds like it's not there there's something even more interesting about

03:03:02	solons that uh Ohio State found out in 2018 that Pollock doesn't really talk about do you know what controls solons it's a question that you brought up to me earlier today magnetic fields remember when we talked about Usain Bolton chicken McNuggets well solons are controlled specifically by magnetic flux so remember what we talked about earlier about magnetic flux you're like okay Jack light can be an electric field magnetic field orthogonal and then you have to be able in your own mind to realize they work like this but then

03:03:38	they can be separated and we can still use them that's part of the entropy part of the story and you're like Jack explain to me how we can separate this in the body it's hard for me to explain it to you when you're not a scientist but you have to trust me that there's books present that show you we use the electric field we use magnetic field I gave you an example earlier in this segment about oxygen being paramagnetic that it's drawn to magnetic fields well here's another one you just brought up

03:04:06	solons solons are created in your C of your ear most people don't know the C of your ear has a huge spiral looks just like a sea shell that you would find in Miami do you know that there's a melanin sheet on the whole CA you actually don't hear sound you know what you hear first light light comes in and then it's changed to an electromechanical energy that actually the CIA picks up and sends all the way into the auditory cortex your brain so let me explain something to you something that you know really

03:04:38	absolutely it's not vibrations in air that are picked up first that's what they teach you in the books but guess what ENT surgeons and neurosurgeons know about manier disease they know about tinitus you know about those apple airpods that I always talk never put in your ear that degrades the melon in your ear the more you degrade the melon in your ear you can't pick up light remember what we talked about about pomy and melon before it makes you superhuman to electromechanical or I should say electromagnetic radiation well if you

03:05:11	degrade the melon in your ear do you think you're going to be able to hear the light as well the answer is no so do that does that mean that the entropy that comes off that which is the solatan MH so what happens when you get Miss information this is like when you were a young boy and you played telephone in your classroom you know the story was oh I went to church on Sunday and when it comes out you know my teacher is a porno star and only fans yeah that's exactly what ten the rumor mill basically right

03:05:43	exactly in other words you also the Byzantine General's Problem by the way correct yeah it is and I'm glad you brought that up because I think bitcoiners will understand it from that perspective but most of them don't understand why they have manier disease they don't understand why they have tenus why because they're putting the Apple airpods in their ears because they think it's a cool thing to do because they're rich and it's the stupidest thing you could ever do because what is it doing it's giving you brain damage

03:06:10	when you do it and it's ruining the solons in your head so everything disal to that you're getting missense information so you may not know this there's a new disease that's occurred in your lifetime that when I was in medical school never learned about have you ever heard of the disease called Mis phonia this is when young kids who most of them use earphones wired any kind of wired or wireless earphones when they hear certain sounds they get reactions like somebody is trying to rape them or trying to beat

03:06:47	them up with this not in other words it's doesn't make sense in other words the response and the stimulus don't marry so what am I trying to tell you earlier today you asked me some really cool questions about Claude Shanny and I told you that the way Claude Shannon Works entropy and the entropy we talk about thermodynamically is the same meaning that information and energy are the same the message for Claude Channon said for it to be resonant it has to be unusual mhm well what I'm telling you is

03:07:23	your system is based like that but in Mis phonia the Fidelity of the stimulus and the result are disconnected in other words they're not entangled so it's a signal Distortion you got it okay let's jump to another book then light shaping life biophotons and biology and Medicine by yeah this is the greatest book ever that everybody should read Roland Van Wick Roland Van Wick so so the concept so I got to tell you a story before you ask me the question okay I spent $100,000 20 years ago translating Japanese and Russian

03:07:59	papers that are buried in the bibliography of this book you can buy this book now for a couple hundred bucks but it cost me $100,000 before the book was published yeah so I want you to think about this is my college tuition that I had to pay to get this information now you guys everything I'm about to tell you that you're going to ask me you no longer have to believe Uncle Jack it's in this book you're very interested about how you're using technology beginning to realize maybe I'm I'm beginning to find out why my gut

03:08:35	doesn't work because guess what no one's actually physically explained to you how the inverse Square law Works what this all means how this translates from photons to this you know we talk about solons and all this you know for most people that listen to this they're going to think this is mumbo jumbo and this and that but guess what any book they open up they're going to find out the papers from Ohio State where magnetic fields control solons you're G like [ __ ] Jack's right like I love the guys on

03:09:07	Twitter there's a guy on Twitter named Helios he always goes like this when Jack says something unusual or outrageous on Twitter he goes I go look it up and then I find out it's true and he goes [ __ ] and here's the thing bitcoiners can't recoil from the [ __ ] moments remember I told you about embracing the suck what am I trying to do Robert when I'm dead and buried and I'm not in your ear [ __ ] you know railing you out I don't want you to be hinny I don't want you to be Steve Jobs and I don't want

03:09:37	you to be Paul Allen I want you to know that I may not like you but I care about you and it's my duty as a decentralized clinician to tell you the truth it's your job as the podcaster to call [ __ ] on me or not when you do your fact checking and find out that Uncle Jack's right all I ask for you is one thing tell some other idiot that doesn't know what you didn't know so what just make sure it's a bit they own ethereum don't tell them supposed to live in your view because obviously we are immersed

03:10:13	in this digital age with all these tools around us all the time use it smartly people have jobs that depend or can only be conducted through the computer we live inside of power grids we got Wi-Fi everywhere like what I've already told you that answer multiple times but you still to seem to be incredulous no no outside so you I'm talking about you specifically now forget about everybody else let's talk about you daylight computer everybody should be using that because it protects you from the blue

03:10:42	light still has the risk it still has the risk of RF and microwaves so what do we do with that that means Robert needs to read his notes to know what he's going to ask the podcast guest try to do that off label maybe your production guys are here hey print this up for me and I'll put notes in front of me yeah and I'm going to do it from notes instead then the cameras you spend extra money charge your your sponsors more to sponsor the podcast move the cameras further away from you you got more money

03:11:17	let's Shi build all the stuff put it as far away from us but let's do the podcast outside also how about we start doing the podcast between 11: and 2:00 why because what did we talk about earlier when's your cognition the best that time so your best podcasts are going to be done when the sun is the best let's do it outside okay we got wind okay we need to have better microphones in other words what I'm telling you use technology as a tool that actually can help you do it so when you're production guy says Robert I need

03:11:49	you to spend $4,000 on a microphone you go [ __ ] that's crazy I got to spend Bitcoin to do that he just Smiles he goes stop being a cheap [ __ ] MH and then you go but you're doing this to reserve your time because you want to be doing podcasts when you're 50 m well in your case 40 MH 50 6 and 65 I want you to do what you do as well for the same reason now in my world I didn't get this message Robert like when I got my come to Jesus moment I was your age right now 39 40 years old and I tried to solve my own

03:12:33	problem and I did a good job fixing that but when I realized truly what the problem was everything in my life changed when I tell you I didn't do surgery at 6:00 in the morning anymore I pushed back till after the sunrise came I went outside took my shirt off every day all my surgery schedule was between 8 and three and I always made sure at solar noon based on the season I was I was in between cases I'd set my schedule up like if somebody wanted to have a brain tumor done I'd say I can't do you on

03:13:08	Thursday I have to do you on Friday so that I can get out in the sun get outside get away from the electronic devices never miss a sun Sunrise try to never miss the sunset drink High latitude water like you did earlier today you drank some duum depleted water depleted water is a smart move for you to do that because we've been around we doing a lot of podcasts me and you have been doing a lot of stuff yeah last couple days right um okay it's just there just so much for someone to change about their lives but I guess that's the

03:13:42	only bitcoiners care about that it's a lot to change from Fiat to bitcoin too but you did that so let me ask you a question you did that for the value of money let me ask you a question what's the most valuable asset you got yeah of course it's time but okay stop hard stop I'm not gonna let you go over that speed bump and take it easy realize what you just said I need you to Stew in those Tomatoes I need you to understand that this is an asset that's more valuable and the reason you don't appreciate it like you

03:14:13	know right now my nurse her dad is in surgery his life can be extinguished MH for him that's really an important discussion guess what I talked to you about Mark Peters earlier today he asked me to get six months worth of time for him yeah it was extremely valuable you're 39 years old and you're like bro time isn't as valuable for me at time is absolutely valuable but what I'm I guess I'm trying to understand is like how we have these modern lives that we've built but you're you're saying flip it over

03:14:46	flip the table over and walk away from it well isn't that what Bitcoin does and sure a lot of people could maybe do that I can maybe do that but I'm thinking of the guy that's like I don't know running a tech company you know you just got I've got guys that are tech companies did you not hear about my friend Jack dorsy did he not do it yeah so what did he do though he left why don't you get him on the podcast and asked him he did everything I'm telling you to do and you're fighting with me he didn't I'm

03:15:09	not fighting with you I'm saying what did he do then so he's still running Twitter and no he he sold Twitter to Elon Musk he said I'm going to was running Twitter and he was doing your protocol was he still using a laptop every day yeah he was using a laptop but he was using it smartly and guess when he did it do smly meaning he did it outside okay not charging like yours is right now because the battery's dead in other words he paid attention to when the battery was going when you said it was 22% earlier and your boy said to you

03:15:39	hey do you need a charger you said no I should be good for two hours guess what you were wrong so guess what don't make that [ __ ] mistake again got it see in other words you're working smarter not harder why because when you work harder what are you doing you're trading time for money I don't want you to ever trade time for money again and realize all these little transactions that you've made while I've been in your presence you don't think Uncle Jack's paying attention to that but I do and see when

03:16:14	you're my patient I really pay attention to it like right now you and me we just met we're not bros we don't hang out we don't do this and that we had one lunch together what am I telling you well I care more about your time than you do that's what I'm telling you I know that I can fix your gut but I don't know that you can fix your gut and I need you to understand that I need you all in I don't need your [ __ ] 80% I need your 100% I don't want to hear you tell me Well Jack I can't do this I can't do

03:16:47	this this that and that then guess what that is the other side of decentralized medicine that's when I fire the patient that's when I say you know what you are better to go to the peteras to the uberman go listen to their podcast because no I'm not going to be able to help you but do I know that I can fix and reverse your problem if you listen to the wisdom I'm giving you yeah because that wisdom is 100% the centralized do I know what it is that's tickling that problem in your two nerves in your gut no I don't I don't yet but

03:17:27	do I know that I can figure it out diagnostically just like Malay figured out for Argentina just like buelli figured out for El Salvador just like you and I are both hoping that [[Donald Trump|Trump]] can figure it out with Bobby in the United States we're hoping we don't know but we're hoping and I'm going to tell you I need you to stop focusing in on your I can'ts and then you start focusing on your I don't think I've said the word I can't once this entire [ __ ] conversation so I know think do you ever get a push back from your patients that

03:18:00	you might be sitting on a high horse a little bit yes absolutely all the time so what I'm just trying to get to is like practical wisdom for an audience that's mired in this stuff already like what are the actual changes they in their life without flipping over their whole [ __ ] lifestyle because a lot of people don't have that option yeah the guy working in it that's been there for 10 or 15 years like maybe he needs to keep working on it for another for whatever reason but he can put flux he can put a red light screen on that if

03:18:27	this the company won't let him do it so let's talk about some of that he can buy a plastic screen that goes over the computer a filter there's software that will block out software will do it but you can have a plastic filter made by Acme Plastics in the United States they'll put it and you can hang it right over you can do it on your TVs too what about flicker flicker was another one flicker is another big effect that is anybody who's got migraines it's totally tied to the lights around you for

03:18:53	example the lights that flicker the most are LED lights those are the lights Obama and Biden gave us what's the lights that everybody knows about their flickers fluorescent lights those are the ones that are in the cubicles the it guys how do you know about flicker when the light goes bad you start to see the fluorescent bulb go what people don't realize is when the light's brand new and you put it in the Box um it flickers 20,000 times per second your brain doesn't perceive it I should say your

03:19:23	eye doesn't see it but your brain perceives it and that's actually what gives you the stroboscopic effects in your brain what are those the most common one is migraines and that when I when I went to Mississippi before I took the job at the Hattisburg Clinic I told the people there they told me how much money they were spending on the neurology clinic for the nurses that worked in the clinic and I sat down with the person that ran their health uh issue and much like you just said to me Jack the people that give you push back

03:19:55	and these people gave me push back when I said to them I think I could save you $2 million if you just listen to what I'm telling you and it turned out the number one thing when I looked at what they were spending money on this lady's name was Judy Lawrence they were spending $2 million on nurses going to the neurology clinic for migraine headaches and they were getting put on drugs I said if can just get rid of the flicker effect that goes away guess what happened when they did that one thing they were able to save money now did

03:20:24	they use that money wisely to do other things no it was the Hattisburg Clinic these people are centralized as [ __ ] they could care less about the people that work for them right well okay um so the other thing that comes up this back in light is shaping life uh the concept of the biof photon H so dates back to the 20th century with Russian scientist Alexander gerwit yep the onion root exper discovered what he called the mitogenic radiation yep and he observed that living cells emitted low levels of ultraviolet light as you

03:21:00	said which you believe could influence cell division and growth so what specifically what that means it controls mitosis okay this was the biggest point that I brought to uberman and he totally [ __ ] the B on and mitosis is mitosis is cell division when cell division chromosomes split and you get two daughter cells in other words so light controlling cell division correct and it's specific it's UV light that does it the light that the dermatologist and the opthalmologist tell you he's toxic to you so every time you put

03:21:36	sunglasses on what are you doing you're affecting mitosis wow every time you wear sunscreen you're affecting mitosis every time you put clothes on you're a different part of your body like when we talked about Frank Zappa prostate cancer you affected mitosis and this is um when you say impacting cell division is like making people age more quickly like what no actually it does something worse it actually keeps a ccent cell meaning a cell that is not able to transform energy from the environment properly

03:22:09	it's a alive no it's a cell that has stayed online with its old stuff this would be like like Robert Breedlove driving in Miami with a 1958 Chevrolet that never had any maintenance and it's got 400,000 miles how good do you think that car is going to run gotcha that so interrupting cell inessence and division it interrupts everything which is the creative destruction correct that keeps you young because remember the two the two change programs of mitochondria I think people know the names of those that's apoptosis

03:22:47	and autophagy what is apoptosis that's sell suicide like the 50h heav is so bad we junk it and we buy a brand new Corvette what is autophagy autophagy is like hey the 58 is pretty good shape it needs new leaf springs and a new parts right we get the salvage parts and guess what we've got a classic and we're good to go that's actually what happens what people don't realize is that UV light controls apoptosis infrared light near infrared light controls autophagy so light controls these processes that

03:23:19	renovate us they're the the mechanic that's in our body that we don't even know that we have and centralized medicine certainly doesn't know but the book that you just referenced actually talks about that mechanic that's really what that book's all about right what's the two things on life that are Immortal a Hydra and what's the second thing cancer stop think about what we just talking about UV light actually controls mitosis so what are you doing when you interrupt mitosis you get cancer so guess what UV light is the

03:23:57	source of C I should say the the problem with cancer cells are not able to make UV light so they become immortal they can never undergo cell suicide they can never undergo autophagy so they stay in their present form and they Decay due to entropy over time they defy C correct and that's the reason why ultimately they kill you so when you have metastasis this is something I said to Rick and uberman and neither one of them picked up on it I think ubin was definitely afraid of it you need UV light to actually get cell turnover so

03:24:35	what are metastasis when you have a cancer this is a cancer going to a different place where cells are creating UV light then they stop the problem is if that cell goes to a tissue that's got UV light but say if it's liver and it's in your skin not a good mix and that's a problem but what people don't realize this is actually the process that mammals use when the asteroid hit to actually suck our hair and our skin that was was uh tan to suck it inside in other words metastasis was a Maman ability that we had that's it's

03:25:17	now been changed to a pathologic problem why because our modern asteroid is this what what destroys UV biophoton Creation in us that non this RF micro so when you asked me the question before and you're like Jack how how are we going to do this this you are people giving you push back of course they [ __ ] are but guess what these are the same [ __ ] people that are living in the time where cancer was out of control so are you're drawing a direct connection here so cancer is the cell that won't engage in cell suicide or be

03:25:54	eaten by other cells won't die Abol it's the immortal the too big to fail Paradigm for institutions is essentially cancerous you're saying absolutely so that's what cancer is basically lack of creative and not only that I think figuratively literally it fits pretty nicely stasis right correct stasis and that's that's the reason why when I sit down and talk to bitcoiners and I talk to people with health it's mindboggling to me how they don't realize that health and wealth are like this they're exactly the same things but

03:26:30	the thing is I think it's because the language that we talk about in health is so radically different than the language we talk about in finance but what's the the language that's the Transformer that allows you to understand this in my opinion what's on that Christmas tree what what's on the wall behind us it's Bitcoin why let's talk about this what how do cells regenerate how do cells undergo apotosis and autophagy the two things we just talked about they turn sunlight into a DC electric current tell me what

03:27:03	Bitcoin runs on electricity right it's the proof of net work it's the same thing but you don't realize that what's controll in your life actually runs the same thing that's in a tree same thing that you that's what's in Becker's book that's one right here look here you go folks the the electron transport chain is both happening within individual organism metabolisms and between organisms well here's the interesting it always stays active but you want to know the interesting part when you're in sunlight that has UV in it you know that

03:27:38	it it actually inhibits electron Train Transport we are designed to make no ATP and slow down electron chain trans so what does that mean this is the basis of the prescription that I wrote 20 years ago the leptin prescription when you're in sunlight you don't need to eat food why because you're making energy from Light which is fundamentally the reason I have huge problems with all the food gurus they want to tell you that it's about protein carbohydrates and fats and guess what I opened up a [ __ ]

03:28:07	biochemistry book and I said show me where the Transporters are for all those things in the inic condal membrane turns out it's only about electrons and protons can you live solely off of sunlight with no food nobody knows cuz nobody's actually tried it there's a lot of people that say they've tried it the people that have been looked at carefully they don't do it they still wind up having to drink water and things like that no so do I believe that we are so complex as UK cariot uh as the I would say the animal

03:28:36	that's furthest from The evolutionary tree no I don't believe that we can do it well but guess what the question you asked before about Hydra they can do it can bacteria do it bacteria can be frozen in the ice right now there's bacteria in the ice in Antarctica that we know has been frozen for three billion years if we thought it [ __ ] works we've already pulled those [ __ ] creatures up from you know ice cones you know that we're using like tree rings and guess what soon as we put them on a pach Tre dish heat them up it's like

03:29:09	they never died May I throw in another question sure so you've spoken about how various events in history of our biological evolution have led to our adaptation towards our current state correct is it possible that in the timeline of humanity in a thousand years time people will look back and say that these devices were the event that caused a new adaptation in Us in other words that's what autism is [ __ ] okay so autism is the adaptation absolutely Elon Musk Elon Musk is a GMO but this is the

03:29:44	case that I tried to make oh that other hypothetical like ad that's one adaptation but Nature's going to try a lot of them almost all the chronic diseases we have if you want to know the truth uh type two diabetes is also an adaptation to living in high latitude I'll give you another one that actually links to your people you know the disease hemocromatosis that you know the Vikings had people in northern European latitudes what was the adaptation there that was actually to avoid the Bubonic plague why you know the plague since the

03:30:15	magnetar has been sequential you know infectious disease that's affected us it turns out if you bleed yourself dry you're less affected by Bubonic plague so when you think about that then you start to go hey is that the reason why we innovated diseases like sickle cell and thalem me a major and minor the answer is yes in other words everything that you see as a disease you see is disease because you're in an environment that no longer selects for that disease but guess what a good example is a disease that Robert

03:30:48	asked me earlier about you know like a genetic disease like cystic fibrosis most common common disease genetic disease in in humans today why is that still selected for there's a reason that's still selected for genetically even though it's not a mitochondrial disease we don't know the answer to that I have a pretty strong suspicion it has to do to mitochondrial heteroplasmy why I wrote a Blog about about that about my best friend that I told you about Jeremy Tomy it's called Jeremy spoke a class today I wrote about

03:31:23	his cystic fibrosis this is a guy that looks right like Robert his family was told he'd be dead at six years old he looks like Michelangelo's David he's more ripped than this guy he does everything that I tell him to do he lives in Mississippi on a Christmas tree farm connected to trees he sells Christmas trees right now it's the busiest time of the year he never wears a shirt never wear a shoes he blows glass he's an artist he's he's a [ __ ] Misfit that's what I call him he's my Misfit when I

03:31:56	first met him the lady that I told you about the Hattisburg Clinic when I went to Mississippi Judy Lawrence do you know who hooked me and Jeremy up her and she said this is my son's best friend the doctors are telling me he's dying she goes I think that you can keep him away and what did he tell me was his biggest uh wish he said Jack and this is the time I met him he's 30 years old he says Jack the the doctors at UAB University of Alabama Birmingham are telling me that I'm going to have a lung

03:32:30	transplant double lung transplant because of the path I'm on uh um I'm going to have problems with this that and the other thing I'm like I'm listening to him he's sitting with me in a [ __ ] Starbucks on Hattisburg 98 and he's drinking one of those [ __ ] green drinks and I tell him first thing we're GNA do is Stir that [ __ ] green drink away because that's going to make you worse and I said then we're going to get up and we're going to go outside and sit outside in the sun and then I'm going to tell you about the

03:33:02	28th latitude where you're at you're technically at the 30th but this has been good but you need to come further south the mistake that he made when Robert started pushing back before about Jack people can't throw the table up Jeremy's got a [ __ ] fatal disease if he [ __ ] up he's [ __ ] dead well just so you know Jeremy's the same age you are right now bro he's 40 years old this [ __ ] is ripped the Viking disease you mentioned earlier I forgot that hemocromatosis isn't methylene blue a good treatment for that think you can

03:33:38	use it for met hemoglobinemia but that's not something we do it turns out the diseases that we just talked about like phemia the one is G6PD deficiency you can't use methylene blue for that can we just talk about what is methylene Blue's role in this mitochondrial function it's pretty simple it's when dyum affects the inner mitochondria and it turns the kreb cycle you know the TCA cycle that you learn about that's called the triar oxic acid cycle and kreb cycle other people earned it about like in St George's time this is a

03:34:20	cycle that goes around and basically it shows how carbon moves but really what it's doing it's a cycle and it's anabolic and catabolic it can spin both ways okay turns out what happens with disease when you inject too much dyum into the system and it breaks because this cycle happens inside the mitochondrial Matrix this is inside that membran that you've been talking about where the electron chain transport is it breaks down then it becomes a linear system and other words you're going back to a time in evolution where the TCA

03:34:58	cycle didn't work here's the very interesting thing about the TCA cycle that your boys in the carnivore world don't know about if you eat carnivore you eat nothing but fat and protein if you don't see the sunrise do you know that you can't use a TCA cycle did you know that no shocking right but guess what don't you think before anybody goes carnivore they should be told that by a [ __ ] centralized doctor or a decentralized doctor there's a guy on Twitter his handle is H htw the [ __ ] guy banned me for saying

03:35:31	that four years ago don't you think he puts a post out like two years ago and goes this [ __ ] told me this a long time ago and I thought he was an [ __ ] and it's true you cannot use the TCA cycle unless you see the sunrise what is methylene blue doing then and recapitulates the T the linear and allows you to move hydrogen so that you can make water remember what I told you the exhaust was the entropy side CO2 and water so if you can't do that you got a big problem so when your TCA cycle is broken for any reason adding methylene

03:36:10	blue could be a solution so where do I publicly talk about methylene blue brought it up because of Rick I told Rick I'll do your podcast if you talk to everybody and tell everybody why Peter ATA was an idiot why because after Rick talked to everybody before he went and had his heart surgery at Stanford I'm the only one after he talked to everybody else said when you're on heart bypass on that machine you need to use methylene blue why because it'll protect the melanin sheets in your ear you now know why

03:36:41	that's a little bit important because Rick best music producer in the world we need that and sheating his brain to work in those acoustic relays why we need all those solons cooking so that we can get the music from him that we want how should people be thinking about using methylene blue is this something I'm I'm going to tell you you're not going to like this answer you have to work with a doctor that knows what they're doing and you want to know the truth the only doctors that know how to use methylene

03:37:08	blue are cardiovascular surgeons and neurosurgeons and when you look at those two Specialties those Specialties don't use it like like not every neurosurgeon knows what I said in the Rick Rubin podcast like what I've said in multiple podcasts since then I use methylene blue when there's huge mitochondrial damage from trauma like when the brain is swelling out of the head that's when I hit it like the famous story that I talked about in Danny's podcast that [ __ ] stunned everybody was the little

03:37:37	girl that Shantel did with me that the guy was trying to rape her and basted her head in and it took me 24 hours to take all the skull out of her brain her [ __ ] brain was out of her head I basically removed half her skull and then put a big balloon around it and I was pushing methylene blue into her constantly why because I was trying to shrink her brain in what didn't I want to do to a 16-year-old girl just cut her [ __ ] brain off so that we could get her through the surgery yeah she'll get

03:38:06	through the surgery she'll live but she's going to be missing half her brain that means the other part of her body won't work is she going to be able to go to college [ __ ] no and I knew that and I felt that I could save her my staff doctor thought I was [ __ ] crazy well guess what you heard how the story went in Danny's podcast turned out she went to college she did fine she recovered 90% of her function wow did I listen to [ __ ] Metallica the whole time I did it was I doing things my own way my decentralized way remember the

03:38:39	story I told you guys in the car today when [ __ ] Mississippi called me down to get my license this the [ __ ] [ __ ] they wanted to know about this was the [ __ ] that I didn't tell them because guess what the guys who are nurs are going to listen to this like I'm not going to do that stuff if I did that in my residency I'd be fired right but guess what Dr Klein wasn't firing me why because he knew that I did the due diligence to do this and he wasn't the staff doctor on that case another doctor

03:39:12	was and he's the guy that told me to give her up and I said [ __ ] you and when I went in front of that Eminem meeting that I told you about morbidity immortality I stood up in front of all those [ __ ] and had to tell them my rationale for what I did you want to know the coolest part of the story that I didn't tell Danny not one of those [ __ ] said a damn word cuz they learned something you they learned something well no [ __ ] the saving the life that's not the story that's not the lesson you know what the

03:39:49	lesson is a [ __ ] stupid resident knew something that a a a goddamn neurosurgeon who's trained for 20 30 40 years didn't know do you know why they didn't know it because they didn't do the due diligence they didn't go and read what they needed to read they didn't even know about maene blue you want to know the thing that pisses me off Robert that's the main problem between centralized and decentralized medicine and if you don't think it's a big deal remember when we talked earlier when you've been

03:40:25	here I told you about some of the things that happened with Danny like he didn't want to go there Luke didn't want to go there well I decided to go there with this why because I knew that I was right right and you have to know when you know something you got to go all in it's just like when a bitcoiner knows I know this this is the way to go you do it but here's the thing when we do make a decision about money dude this isn't a life or death thing this for this little girl life or death it was and let me

03:41:03	just tell you something I don't take gambling on time lightly like for me dude this is why I took that oath What Separates Me I want you to remember what I said about Peter AA he told Rick before the surgery what Jack told you is [ __ ] crazy well I got news to you you ever do Rick's podcast ask him how [ __ ] crazy I am now yeah with him sitting across from you but guess what you don't see [ __ ] Peter AA coming out on his [ __ ] podcast telling people his Mia Cula right in other words the Eminem conference that should

03:41:38	[ __ ] happen hasn't happened that that's the difference between [ __ ] him and me methylene blue and light what is the is there a relation there is what's it doing with light this is kind interes it increases uh if you do infrared therapy right it's supposed to enhance the infrared therapy it does but it works by something that's very unique to photob modulation there's a law that tells you a little bit of light is better than a lot this is one of the crazy things about methylene blue when you hit somebody with methylene

03:42:16	blue you can only give them a certain amount of light you can't give them too much so for example you probably heard the story that I did with shantel's Dad about his AMD when we fixed his AMD using red light we didn't use methylene blue in him but we hit him with a [ __ ] ton of red light if I hadn't given him methylene blue which I could have done I could have used less red light to get him better to get the same result mhm but the thing is you have to be working with a doctor that actually [ __ ]

03:42:48	understands that issue most of the jackasses that are out there they don't understand the nonlinear effects of methylene blue most of them don't even understand that methylene blue is a base chemical that's a Dye it's related to hydroxychloroquine so hydroxy chloroquin is a drug that worked for Co so when you know Mary T Bowen who I think is a rock star who I just did a podcast you know with about this she got got in trouble with the Texas Medical Board for using drugs outside the covid regimen you know

03:43:21	that her hospital at Houston Methodist you know pushed if she hadn't known this story about methylene blue she could have actually skated past the Texas Medical Board the medical staff bylaws but this is the reason why you have to be careful like if I start telling people my secret sauce of the things that I'm doing then what happen happens to me when I'm the only guy doing this I go in front of the medical board and they're like this is crazy talk nobody else does this this is not studied doesn't matter how many papers I show

03:43:55	him from 1927 1934 1936 but guess what when I did that M&M conference to save that little girl's life I pulled out all those [ __ ] papers and showed my neurosurgeons that this was in the literature that you [ __ ] didn't read it how do you like that see now here's the funny thing my people years realized that I did the work but if you go and do that in the medical staff bylaws you go do that for the Texas Medical Board you go do that no that's you stepped out of the line you have to be and do what everybody else does

03:44:33	because guess what it's a centralized system we need you to have somebody with covid you give them injection and then they go on and they come back 6 months later and they get another one and that's how we do things and if they they get sick they get sick and it's not the vaccine that causes it that's not how medicine is practiced that's how medicine is practiced when there's a Oracle that's sitting between me and you right now that's the difference between centralized and decentralized Medicine what is the

03:45:01	Oracle in that the Oracle and that is the journal editors that blocked all this information got it like why didn't you learn about methylene blue and Co you probably just knew or heard that you could use methylene Lear about it through biohacking which was yeah another decentralized but you probably didn't know about it with Co that actually was a solution for Co but why didn't you learn that because the journal editors in the New England Journal of Medicine and and every other Journal would never let this be

03:45:29	published because if it did that mean that Dr fouche's uh emergency use authorization was illegal that me means that the covid vaccine could never been popped how does the proposal you made to buelli use Bitcoin to solve that problem well I mean that that is a that's what I call a Quantum Leap in this discussion yeah that's when we're going to attempt to use zero knowledge proofs and the open time stamps of Bitcoin to actually disintermediate the IP what does that do when you disintermediate the IP it takes

03:46:02	the journal articles out why this is a PhD I'm giving you an analogy now someone like Dr Alexis C who worked in the rebitz lab that we talked about earlier today at lunch she goes and does studies that say she gets money from Nicole Shanahan she finds out Nicole has a specific question she wants to answer about her daughter Echo so she uses photobomb modulation and say crystals to see if she can deliver near infrared light and UV light into her daughter to somehow make the situation for autism better so she can stimulate her

03:46:37	mitochondria to go through better autophagy and beta apotosis she can do that study in this system that study if we did it say at the University of or Princeton where the Reno slab is that would take 12 to 18 months to get done in this new system it would take four to six weeks to get done and then Alexis could turn around and say I'd like Michael Hamlin and say Tina Karu the two experts in this area to review my paper and I'm going to stake you argument sake I'm going to give $2,500 for each one of you to do it so

03:47:14	that means you Do It meeing Tina KW or Michael Hamlin but not the phds in your program because right now how peerreview works the journal uh editors they're in between this process they're the ones that pick the reviewers the people that do the research have no say in this game at all so you have now the guys in the centralized Tower tell you who can review it and then once they review it they decide if it get published or not God it so this is a centrally controlled semi-permeable membrane do you want to

03:47:51	hear the the worst part that we haven't talked about yet do you know who owns that system Robert Maxwell and glain Maxwell how's that you didn't think [[Jeffrey Epstein|Epstein]] was going to come into this environment Go On The Mad Des [[Zionism|Zionist]] these are the guys know who Robert Maxwell was dual passport guy in your boy's country UK this is Delaine Maxwell The Madam of [[Jeffrey Epstein]] right her family owns all the journals and the peer review process so what does that tell you that tells you that somebody in the UK that

03:48:37	has passports in the UK and passports in Israel controls the science done through the that's not really science that's not truth discover tell me let's go back to our first day that we talked aren't we back as you like to coin the term conspiracy theory is it really conspiracy when I just told you the person that's running the Oracle problem in centralized science is actually a person that owns periodicals papers newspapers aren't we back to Edward ber and propaganda and how are there not other periodicals or journals competing

03:49:14	with them there are they're predatory journals but they can't compete why because they don't own the right journals remember how this works my friend uh I want you to think about [[Bitcoin]] now if something is done on lightning or say liquid as bitcoiners we're like we're okay with that but what if something ran on salana we were like yeah I'm not I'm not doing that or something run on teso or something worked on some other chain because it worked here we'd be like yeah I'm not going to allocate Capital to

03:49:48	that well the same thing is true in medicine it's prestigious to publish in the Lancet it's prestigious to publish in cell it's prestigious to publish in the New England Journal of Medicine well guess who controls all those journals the people that I just told you so do you understand now why I'm really mad because it turns out science is stolen by the same people that are tied to the other parts this story is this a money printing problem again abut they control of course it is they centralize and

03:50:20	control scientific narrative through centralization and control of the money 100% it's the reason why you never got the truth about anything it's the reason why the neurosurgeons didn't know about methylene blue and the little girl why you realize that methylene blue is off patent do you know why you didn't learn anything about methylene blue off patent Dirt Cheap you know what the price for big farmer was that they made on these messenger rnas I don't even have to tell you what the number is you already know

03:50:50	cuz this is discoverable in this podcast Anthony fouchy made $440 million of royalties jesz do you think he can make $440 Million worth of royalties in methylene blue let's take it a step further Mary T Bal ENT doctor who first used hydroxych chloroquin which I told you comes from methylene blue chemically that got taken away from because the pharmacies wouldn't do it then she started to use monoclonal antibodies worked they took that away from her so what does she do next this ican thing turns out it also works do you know why

03:51:25	Ivor meon got taken away also a drug off patent just like methylene blue and guess what happened the Texas Medical Board tries to take her license away the FDA posts that famous picture online about it's horse paace come on give me a break I can't believe you're doing this she sues the FDA over that ad you want to know what happens she wins the FDA has to pull that ad off of Twitter how do you like that but the thing is you as a Bitcoin and don't know this happened but you know that you just lived through

03:52:02	this [ __ ] [ __ ] storm thought we all did but you got to realize something Mary T Bowen a centralized ENT was fighting for Robert breb and every Bitcoin poin her out there because what was she doing she was taking an off-patent drug that big farmer couldn't make money from and trying to help your [ __ ] sorry ass and you didn't realize that she was working for us she's part of the orange pill crew and you want to know the sad part Mary's probably going to listen to this and be mad at me but she's a no coiner and I'm trying to get

03:52:39	her orange builds I'm trying to tell her about our world about this how this could pay off her $200,000 of legal bills that she did she was fighting on our behalf as patients I'm hoping some Bitcoin I'm hoping somebody like Elon Musk or Jack dorsy or even Nicole Shanahan listens to this and says you know what I'm just going to pay her bill why because that's the kind of doctor that we need to fight for us yeah and I want people to understand how this system is so corrupted because it is the money yeah

03:53:14	and if you don't understand these stories these anecdotes I'm giving you dude this is my life this is why I'm [ __ ] pissed off about this whole system yeah gentl interrupt for one second 10 more minutes Chantel wants to make some transition no I think I think we're good here actually I think this is a great place to bring it to a close we've come back to bitcoin and we're going to dive deeper into Bitcoin philosophy all these things and in our future session so thank youle question to us I'm just

03:53:44	curious is the brain how would you conceptualize it a processor a receiver like what it is it like generating things or is it receiving intuition intuition I don't know the answer is yes to all those things okay right I was just curious It's a big thing I couldn't you've just broken down how the body is not what I thought it was and now I'm like what the [ __ ] the brain because it's not the same oper the brain the brain is like the horn on that that animal so so you conceptualize it as a receiver by directional

03:54:15	yeah it's an electromagnetic antenna but you have to realize does it work Quantum mechanically does it have Joseph's Junctions in it yeah does it work by semiconduction does it work with water Absol all of it yes it is the first ever quantum computer on the planet that has very unique abilities what's it really built for you want to know what it's optimized for to tell trends like when we are doing recognition yeah pattern recognition is the big thing like why why did Robert or myself become bitcoiners early on we picked up the

03:54:52	scent early but remember when we you and I talked about sense earlier like we don't realize we used to track our mates through sent but our brain is actually doing that there's actually quantum mechanical process like Luca Turin has described how we smell electromagnetically a guy was given a Nobel prize for the way we don't that's the recept after that's total [ __ ] but that's what the guy got the Nobel Prize for and you know this brings up another part maybe we end on this do you know why the Nobel Prize got its name do

03:55:27	you guys have any clue about the history of the Nobel Prize sish no LA right great do you know that no Alfred nober was a douchebag right everybody hated him so what did he do I'm going to offer a cash prize give it out so that I get good PR and everybody thinks I'm a good guy today nobody knows that he was originally a douchebag so guess what this guy is basically Rockefeller and rild except because he gave a prize away for centralized science everybody thinks he's a great guy propaganda it's core again we come

03:56:01	back to the Edward Bernay thing but guess what Nobel started this before Edward Bernay so what am I trying to tell you those things were percolating in The Ether and then bernes puts it all together that actually propaganda is actually something that we can use to change our perception in that pattern recognition machine that nature built over 3.8 billion years by using pomy and using light and using water and using carbon based semiconductors that to me is the most amazing part and the other thing

03:56:41	that our brain does that I I did talk to you guys about earlier so it does something even more amazing it allows us to see the World As It Isn't So that way we can Game Theory out things that can happen in our imagination simulation generator correct so guess what ideation without execution leads to deletion of every good idea so if you have a good idea you don't execute on it what's our vernacular in Bitcoin you get Bitcoin at the price you deserve if you didn't buy it that's your college tuition but when you think about

03:57:12	it this has multiple iterations like we could take consideration and talk about science like how you didn't use it you could talk about the girl you let get away or you could talk about like okay I didn't have faga today at monara understand what I'm saying it's kind of like you look at his face when he was eating the [ __ ] Guan you go dude I probably should have got that opportunity but then he looked at you when you're eating like the pasta and you're like oh so you just started to see something you were able to imagine

03:57:45	your brain the joy that that other person was going through you don't experience it but you have the ability to imagine empathy well you're sharing it you're sharing it through other people correct that's that's the part of the quantum entanglement because we were all together in that space you guys got to see people doing different things even though you didn't have the experience you're like but I learned something about the people that were at this lunch and I learned something about how their

03:58:18	brain tolerated when he like when he put that fagua on his mouth and I looked at him and he just put his head back and this and that made me happy because he trusted me he didn't know me he knows me as well as all three of you guys do but when he put it in his mouth I just smiled I'm like how do you like me now it's just like when Robert says okay I got one of my guys in you know my my man cave to buy [[Bitcoin]] you go how do you like me now or you know when Robert says Okay I want to have some wine let's put

03:58:51	some p in it hey that's actually pretty good it's a new experience like when you have a new experience with someone you get to learn something it's not something that is in your experience but you can take something away even if you don't have the experience our brain allows us to simulate that situation so therefore when we're faced with a new opportunity yeah we're prepared you got it and that's what makes our brain amazing but guess what the animal on my wall back there that animal doesn't have

03:59:28	that ability our nearest relatives don't have that ability you know what the most amazing thing about silly talking monkeys are that we have the ability to see the world as it isn't that's when Robert pushed back today and I told him I need you to understand the first 25 years of Uncle Jack's life I lived without that [ __ ] [ __ ] and I did perfectly fine without it and I'm telling you I know something you don't know without which [ __ ] this [ __ ] oh yeah can we tomorrow I'm just curious this as a broad thing because like I see

04:00:01	you get animated about certain things and I'm like okay you don't nor talk about these things no you're a neuroscientist we're now talking about cognitive theory perception time intuition yeah but that's all that's still all brain stuff yeah yeah but that's the thing I think that those guys have [ __ ] stolen our science no but the thing is like it would be interesting just this conversation where it goes like that is all fascinating stuff and it's a different branch of your cognitive process which you have

04:00:28	every right to have authority over because you're a [ __ ] neuroscientist regardless of the authority that that brings it's legitimized by the fact that you've thought about these things Beyond just mechanisms I think it's you can't be you can't be a brain interesting subject yeah but you can't be a brain surgeon you can't be a bra but you your brain surgeon without this you have to realize we deal we deal with the whole quantum computer yeah if you don't think that where reduction is take it apart

04:00:54	and know like like I'll give you a for example you know one of the most amazing things about brain surgery that nobody ever talks about I can go in and take your temporal lobe your frontal lobe out literally move 160 your brain and you will be exactly the same if I put you through a neurologic exam with um a neurologist and you go that [ __ ] is astounding so what does that tell you is it the sheer size of your brain or is there something else that allows this computer to do what it does like you could wax lyrical I'm sure on

04:01:30	like the whole Phineas gauge thing right so like I I feel like there's real [ __ ] meat on the bone for this guy to go into different territory like but I don't I don't mean different I mean like well this isn't different to me this is the same exactly but the thing is used to talk about Phineas Gage when I was centralized neurosurgeon you got a spike blown through your head and all of a sudden we learn about frontal loes thing is that to have your perception on on subjects that most people have never heard of well we're

04:01:58	gonna well we're gonna do the the philosophy day which I think that's kind of what you're getting at is like let's go to the bottom of your worldview the bottom of your understanding of the world you're talking a lot about mechanisms of brain and the body but like why we think the way we do not not just beyond an emerging property but like [ __ ] Evolution has an intention apparently we don't know what it's what God's eye is like just I think we I think we know I think I think uh evolution is driven by Redux chemistry

04:02:28	in other words the more net negative charge we make that's what drives us that way remember I told you earlier that when you drink from a fire hose it's very difficult that blows your lips out and this and that and that when you go against the thermodynamic flow flow that's the wrong thing well guess what what's the basic thermodynamic flow in biology and evolution the more negative charge the better the more positive charge the worse so for example when we talked about chlorophyll and then we talked about melanin and hemoglobin in

04:03:00	the middle what did chlorophyll provide less that negative charge it only charge separated water into two electrons melanin does four actually Millions so that is actually the basic thermodynamics that brings you right back to some of the things that sailor said to to Robert [ __ ] eight years ago four years ago whenever the [ __ ] it was you know it's a thermodynamic answer if the airplanes you know gear is bad you're not going to want to land that [ __ ] plane well it turns out if there is you are thermodynamically sound then

04:03:39	you can do a lot more that's effectively the difference between us and the Rhino on the wall but if you think the Rhino on the wall doesn't have some amazing Quantum abilities in it you're a [ __ ] idiot because it does it has some abilities that have atrophied in you it can find its way around Africa and You' be [ __ ] s in there with your iPhone and go why doesn't this work because you don't have magnetochemistry in you anymore that operates why because it's been atrophied by every time you use a

04:04:10	Garmin device it's no different than when you put like a a cast on your leg you don't realize that are there any casts on the leg for animals in the wild no but guess what we know that animals break their leg and they're able to recover well we go well we'd like to know how they do that but you don't know what animals are doing in the wild MH you know we don't have that we don't have the ability for you guys to put your camera in their cubby holes and see what happens to the leg when it's broken and how they recover but do

04:04:40	we know that happens we do we found animals that are injured and like how the [ __ ] did they recover from this it's kind of like the story I told you about the little girl that got her head bash in you know from the lamp like people hear that story and they're like holy [ __ ] you wouldn't think someone could recover and get 90% of their function back but why does that happen it happens because a doctor didn't know she was coming in but when he was free decided to read papers from 1927 and 1934 about methylene blue and

04:05:19	said I think if I use this I can help this girl and guess what is there any thermodynamic cost to me no because guess what she's going to [ __ ] die anyway it's the story I told you guys about Mark Peters the centralized doctors told him he's going to die in two weeks nothing so what does he got to lose okay let's give him duum depleted water and some red light and see what happens I mean what the [ __ ] is the problem but guess what but when that happens and it works we talk about it on a podcast that's when you hope there's

04:05:49	some jackass watching this is a centralized doctor and they go [ __ ] I never thought about that maybe I should consider that or maybe somebody watches the podcast and says maybe I should sell my salon and just [ __ ] buy [[Bitcoin]] and forget about all this nonsense I mean that what we're trying to do is get people back centralized medicine is a shitcoin 100% thanks for watching if you enjoyed this episode click here to find more just like it and here to find our most recent episode also make sure to like this
