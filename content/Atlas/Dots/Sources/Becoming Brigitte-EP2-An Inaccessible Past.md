# Summary of the Overall Episode

Owens frames her investigation as a counter-narrative to the French mainstream media, which she accuses of suppressing truth through smears and controlled storytelling. The episode combines detailed analysis of media portrayals, family photo discrepancies, and Macronâ€™s personal history, interspersed with sponsor promotions and audience engagement.

## Critique of Brigitteâ€™s Media Narrative

Owens takes a break from darker allegations (e.g., pedophilia) to debunk the mainstream mediaâ€™s portrayal of Brigitte as a "hot, bold" figure who defied her Catholic upbringing. She reads verbatim from past publications, describing Brigitte at 14-15 swapping her school uniform for miniskirts, dancing wildly, and flirting as an "inveterate party girl." These accounts, she argues, were crafted to romanticize her relationship with a 14-year-old Emmanuel Macron, portraying him as lucky to attract such a charismatic teacher. Quotes from alleged colleagues and students (e.g., Brigitteâ€™s "irresistible legs" and allure) are presented as fabricated to soften public perception of the age gap and power dynamic.

## Biographical Scrutiny and Photo Controversies

The episode pivots to the 2018 official biography Brigitte Macron: La Femme Libre by Mayel Brun, which Owens criticizes for lacking childhood or young mother photos, with the earliest image from 1993 showing Brigitte as a 40-year-old teacher. Similarly, Virginie Linhardâ€™s documentary Brigitte Macron: Un Roman FranÃ§ais, aired on government-owned France 3, is faulted for relying on photos from 1986 onward, omitting 23 crucial early years (e.g., marriage, motherhood). Linhardâ€™s own comments about facing a "thick wall of silence" from Brigitteâ€™s chief of staff, Pierre-Olivier Costa, and the control exerted by Mimi Marchandâ€™s Best Image agency, are cited as evidence of suppression. Two childhood photosâ€”a first communion image resembling daughter Tiphaine and a family photo introducing an unaccounted-for brother, Jean-Michel Trogneuxâ€”are flagged as explosive. The communion photoâ€™s authenticity is questioned due to alleged recoloring (later retracted by Owens), while the family photo sparks speculation about Jean-Michel and his son Jean-Jacques, who resembles Macron.AndrÃ©-Louis AuziÃ¨reâ€™s MysteryOwens labels AndrÃ©-Louis AuziÃ¨re, Brigitteâ€™s alleged husband of 32 years, as the "French Republicâ€™s best-kept secret." She notes the sole Wikipedia photo was misidentified by politician FranÃ§ois Ruffin as a teacher, Mr. Hugo, fueling public suspicion. The lack of photos from Brigitteâ€™s married life with AuziÃ¨re (died 2019) is presented as a glaring omission.

## Emmanuel Macronâ€™s Elusive Past

The focus shifts to Macronâ€™s biography, described by Xavier Poussard as a "mystery." Classmates recall him as a loner with no known friends or vacation details, and early life photos are scarce, starting at age 12 with his baptism. His autobiography Revolution devotes minimal space to family (e.g., five pages on his grandmother, one on parents), contrasting with detailed mentions of Brigitteâ€™s children. Family estrangement is evident, with brother Laurent denying closeness and cousin Nicole rarely seeing sister Estelle. Unauthorized 2017 Paris Match photos of a young Macron, uncredited and never reused, add to the enigma.

## Regional and Linguistic Anomalies

Owens highlights Macronâ€™s disconnect from Amiens, with former mayor Gilles de Robien suggesting heâ€™s from Le Touquet, and his absence from the 2018 Battle of Amiens centenary. A 2018 Andorra visit gaffeâ€”claiming great-grandparents spoke a non-existent language "Penan"â€”is cited as evidence of a fabricated heritage, linked to his maternal roots in BagnÃ¨res-de-Bigorre.

## Visual Evidence and Speculation

Side-by-side photos of Jean-Jacques Trogneux and Macron are teased, hinting at a possible identity overlap. Owens urges viewers not to trust their eyes, mocking media denials, and teases future episodes on Macronâ€™s grandparents and parentsâ€™ psychiatric work, possibly tied to government programs like MK Ultra.Sponsorships and Audience InteractionPromotions for Pre-Born (abortion pill reversal), Field of Greens (health supplement), and American Financing (debt relief) interrupt the narrative, reflecting Owensâ€™ independent funding model. Audience comments range from support to off-topic queries (e.g., clothing sources, Ryan Reynolds), with Owens engaging humorously, reinforcing her persona as a relatable, faith-driven investigator.

## Overall Narrative

The episode expands Owensâ€™ conspiracy theory, alleging the Macronsâ€™ lives are fabricated to hide unknown truths. Brigitteâ€™s "pinup" image and Macronâ€™s elusive past are dissected through photo absences and inconsistent accounts, with legal letters from the Macrons dodging substantive denials. The introduction of Jean-Michel Trogneux and Jean-Jacques suggests a potential identity swap, while Macronâ€™s regional and linguistic errors fuel doubts. Owens portrays this as a battle against a controlled narrative, blending investigative zeal with provocative speculation, supported by her audienceâ€™s enthusiasm.

03:51
in our minds that macron had simply hit theÂ 
jackpot right he fulfilled the fantasy of everyÂ Â 

03:57
boy his age because he got to sleep with that hotÂ

04:04
by inserting sometimes Anonymous quotes fromÂ 
former colleagues of Brit and alleged classmatesÂ Â

are real quotes that were published in the mainÂ Â 

04:16

06:01

2018 okay what happens next is a woman named mayelÂ Â 

06:06
Brun she was then the head of the celebritiesÂ 
department at the magazine closer published theÂ Â 

06:13

mcon La froni okay which means in English theÂ 
freed woman look at that cover wow she's freeÂ Â 

06:27
amazing look at that face she's Happ happy she'sÂ 
glowing and it was essentially really a book thatÂ Â 

06:33
was just a regurgitation or rather a compilationÂ 
of everything that I just said to you everythingÂ Â  that had already been published and I'll tell youÂ 
why this was immediately considered a departureÂ Â 

06:43
from previous authorized biographies of a firstÂ 
lady or president and that's because there wasÂ Â 

06:48
absolutely no pictures provided of brigit mccroneÂ 
as a child and there were no pictures provided ofÂ Â 

06:54
her as a young mother in fact the earliest pictureÂ 
Okay in this Auto authorized biography was fromÂ Â 

07:01
1993 when Brit was already teaching by that timeÂ 
at the Providence school so here it is this is theÂ Â 

07:08
earliest photo that they included wait a secondÂ 
okay so the caption beneath that photo read RITÂ Â 

07:17
oier is 40 she's married she's the mother of threeÂ 
she's quite appreciated at the high school whereÂ Â 

07:22
she teaches she's about to make the encounter thatÂ 
will cause an upheaval we cause an upheaval of herÂ Â 

07:28
life okay so they just went ahead and decidedÂ 
to erase the first 40 years in this uh officialÂ Â 

07:37
biography then six months later in June of 2018Â 
a Woman by the name of uh virgin leanard whoÂ Â 

07:46
normally focused on creating documentaries aboutÂ 
World War II and the Holocaust essentially turnedÂ Â 

07:52
the book a biography of Brit into a documentaryÂ 
which was entitled Brit mcon un Roman France whichÂ Â 

08:00
is just means uh a French novel and that wasÂ 
released on the France 3 Channel now I shouldÂ Â 

08:06
mention to you that this is a government-ownedÂ 
channel okay it was created in 1969 by the OfficeÂ Â  of the President this is like PBS BBC okay weÂ 
are not in conspiracy land this is a reputableÂ Â 

08:20
woman Virginia leanard who makes documentaries andÂ 
of course documentaries are supposed to includeÂ Â  a ton of photos think about whatever you wereÂ 
watching when you were coming up for me maybeÂ Â 

08:30
Britney Spears Christina aguiler a documentariesÂ

08:35
and you're seeing their siblings and you'reÂ 
seeing them at Disney World and you're seeingÂ Â  them you know doing whatever was normal for theÂ 
time that they were growing up a Michael JacksonÂ Â 

08:43

and by the way I want to be clear virin linhardÂ Â 

08:49
did have tons of photos just you know almost allÂ 
of them again from Brit teaching days beginningÂ Â 

08:55
in 1986 in strawberg and ending in Paris in 2015Â 
so I'm going to show you the photos that were inÂ Â 

09:03

collage actually of all of the photos there youÂ Â 

09:11

me out of that so they can see the full thing waitÂ Â 

09:16
okay what's going on here because I was reliablyÂ 
informed that brigit oier was a hot sexy pinupÂ Â 

09:24

the kind of woman that the the boys just couldn'tÂ Â 

09:30

10:25
documentary maybe my producer made a mistakeÂ 
what okay I don't know I don't know where theÂ Â  pinup girl is I'm sorry guys I I just I feel likeÂ 
I've let you down anyways Virginia linhard theÂ Â 

10:36
documentary maker like I said is well respected soÂ 
surely she must have tried to get many more photosÂ Â 

10:43
before Brit's teaching years if she's not a fraudÂ 
uh then that would have been the first thing sheÂ Â 

10:48
would have tried to do interestingly enough sheÂ 
spoke out regarding just how difficult it was forÂ Â 

10:55
her to make the documentary she said and I quoteÂ 
it's difficult to investigate brigit macron muchÂ Â 

11:02
more than I imagined on the substance on the formÂ 
on everything as soon as I started making contactsÂ Â 

11:10
I was summoned by Pierre Olivier Costa bit's chiefÂ 
of staff and Tristan brome rit's other Chief ofÂ Â 

11:17
Staff it was almost like a police interrogationÂ 
what do I want to show who will I be interviewingÂ Â 

11:24
I made a list of people that I wanted to meet butÂ 
I could not apply that list the interviewees apartÂ Â 

11:31
from her former students all had the authorizationÂ 
of the Alise Palace and were very careful aboutÂ Â 

11:38
what they said there is a thick wall of SilenceÂ 
the level of control and checking is well quiteÂ Â 

11:44
astounding my documentary is a 90minut veryÂ 
personal portrait for it I needed photographsÂ Â 

11:53
of young Brit mcon small children that would showÂ 
an itinerary not those approved by by Best ImageÂ Â 

12:00
agency what won't be released is anything to doÂ 
with her former life it's a total blackout endÂ Â 

12:08
quote Oh best image agency now didn't we justÂ 
go over that um yesterday that's Mimi's agencyÂ Â 

12:14
that was authorizing the photos that were allowedÂ 
to go out so apparently Mimi's agency authorizedÂ Â  the photos that could go out for this documentaryÂ 
as well now virgini linhard did however receiveÂ Â 

12:26
two photos from bit's alleged child Ood one theÂ 
public was told was from Brit then trogo wouldÂ Â 

12:34
have been her last name her first communionÂ 
I'm going to show you that photo here it isÂ Â 

12:39
and another photo now Infamous photo of theÂ 
entire trogo family allegedly taken about aÂ Â 

12:46
year after brigit's birth okay that is the fullÂ 
trno family photo which we will come back to soÂ Â 

12:55
now really all that was missing from that photo ofÂ 
her communion until the school photos which appearÂ Â 

13:02
in 1986 was 23 years of Brit's life the mostÂ 
crucial years of her life you know like I don'tÂ Â 

13:09
know her being a teenager her getting married atÂ 
21 her allegedly having three babies her gettingÂ Â 

13:16
married to a banker named Andre Louise oier whoÂ 
was her husband of 32 years like I don't knowÂ Â 

13:22
did you do do people not take photos of them andÂ 
their husbands in France I don't know VirginiaÂ Â 

13:29
linhard actually referred to Andre Lise oierÂ 
reit's alleged husband of 32 years as the FrenchÂ Â 

13:37
Republic's best kept secret and certainly you guysÂ 
it appeared that way because at the time that theÂ Â 

13:43
documentary was released there was only one photoÂ 
that was available of her ex-husband that had evenÂ Â 

13:50
made its way onto Wikipedia as her ex-husbandÂ 
there it is Andre Luiz oier and you can see itÂ Â 

13:56
has his date of birth and it has his date of deathÂ 
and it has the dates that they were married fromÂ Â  1974 to 2006 all of that is correct except forÂ 
the photo itself yeah could you pull that up againÂ Â 

14:07
that photo it turned out was not actually AndreÂ 
Luiz oier because um a former student who had goneÂ Â 

14:14
on to become a politician his name is FrancoisÂ 
ruffen also went to Providence school and he cameÂ Â 

14:19
out and said that's not Andre louiz oier that's MrÂ 
Hugo a teacher at the school oopsies NH whateverÂ Â 

14:29
but I got to tell you that oopsie did make theÂ 
public think what what's going on here man this isÂ Â  kind of getting weird it's a little weird okay andÂ 
I have to tell you guys there was some immediateÂ Â 

14:38
feedback from the public some early musings ifÂ 
you will about the two photos too which had beenÂ Â 

14:45
released from bit's alleged childhood foremostÂ 
a communion photo caused a bit of a stir becauseÂ Â 

14:52
many felt that it was a Dead Ringer that photo notÂ 
of first lady brijit mccrone who was side by sideÂ Â 

14:59
here uh bit oier and her alleged communion photoÂ 
they didn't feel like that was strong but theyÂ Â 

15:05
did feel that it was a dead ringer for her veryÂ 
chatty daughter ton they thought that that looksÂ Â 

15:13
like ton okay and um like I said she was the onlyÂ 
daughter the only uh s uh child of brigit that wasÂ Â 

15:22
willing to participate in the documentary she wasÂ 
willing to speak to Virgin for like an hour and umÂ Â 

15:29
like I said it doesn't help that best image theÂ 
photo agency uh had supplied the image peopleÂ Â 

15:35
were wondering and I include myself in this wasÂ 
it perhaps edited no Mimi as we learn later onÂ Â 

15:44
has been accused of a lot of forgery and stuff andÂ 
all sorts of crimes man you got to look into MimiÂ Â  Maran so it's not like totally crazy to wonderÂ 
if maybe she's being used because she does playÂ Â 

15:55
around a bit and she's willing to do crimes youÂ 
know so yeah it was uh it was in fact my musingsÂ Â 

16:02
about that was one of the areas of nitpick oneÂ 
of the areas that the macron's had included whenÂ Â 

16:09
they initially sent me the first strongly wordedÂ 
letter because I had claimed on a show dating backÂ Â 

16:15
to March of last year that the photo was recoloredÂ 
I looked at it and I said that photo looks too newÂ Â 

16:21
it looks like it's it's recolored now having andÂ 
I was just getting into this bizarre story and soÂ Â 

16:27
I was just inves investigating asking questionsÂ 
reading other people's investigations now I'm aÂ Â 

16:33
lot deeper on the facts and I now know for aÂ 
fact that that photo was not recolored okayÂ Â 

16:40
similarly at the beginning when I was tryingÂ 
to understand this case I I had asked XavierÂ Â  pussard about the theory which a lot of peopleÂ 
were wondering which was did the real brit trnoÂ Â 

16:51
die when she was a child and did perhaps briÂ 
mcon take her identity again that was a thatÂ Â 

16:59
was floating around the internet and I now knowÂ 
for a fact that no she did not die when she wasÂ Â 

17:04
a child so let's go back actually and take a lookÂ 
at their first carefully worded legal letter toÂ Â 

17:11
me this is their repeat strategy I'm going to keepÂ 
reminding you of this the way that they sue peopleÂ Â  the way that they go after people in court is theyÂ 
ignore the substance of the claims substance beingÂ Â 

17:21
was current first lady brigit macron bornÂ 
a biological male it's a simple yes or noÂ Â 

17:29
question and instead of attacking that theyÂ 
wait for people to make a mistake as they tryÂ Â 

17:34
to Garner the answer and of course mistakes willÂ 
be made of course you could say this photo isÂ Â  recolored and they go Boop go after her go afterÂ 
her she suspect saying that bit trno di a childÂ Â 

17:44
go after her so this is the uh the legal letterÂ 
we'll show you that they wrote you're discreditÂ Â 

17:52
you're discrediting of these photos is not onlyÂ 
without Merit but also internally inconsistent inÂ Â 

17:58
your episode on March 11th and March 13th and JuneÂ 
17th you claim that the first communion photo isÂ Â 

18:04
an altered image of to phone oier however in yourÂ 
August 30 podcast you agreed with pussard thatÂ Â 

18:12
the photo depicts the real prit trugo before sheÂ 
passed away at a young age another falsehood nowÂ Â 

18:20
I want to be very clear Xavier pussard has neverÂ 
said that briet trno passed away at a young ageÂ Â 

18:25
but I may have asked him the question and wasÂ 
speculating about whether not she passed awayÂ Â  which they claim is another falsehood then theyÂ 
say both hypotheses could not be further from theÂ Â 

18:35
truth more you alleged that the first communionÂ 
photo had been debunked repeatedly and that theÂ Â 

18:41
Press now states its attribution to Mrs macronÂ 
was a mistake but you have not cited any OutletsÂ Â 

18:47
or articles retracting the photo surely you wouldÂ 
provide this devastating proof If you had it butÂ Â  you do not okay doing a little dance there why doÂ 
they not just simply State who who the person inÂ Â 

18:59
the commun photo is why not just say say plainlyÂ 
if you're going to write a legal letter CandiceÂ Â  the person in this commun photo is not tone oierÂ 
and the photo is not recolored and it is in factÂ Â 

19:12
first lady brijit mccrone they don't do that theyÂ 
never do that why not also simply State what theÂ Â 

19:17
truth is rather than saying that the hypothesesÂ 
are far from the truth so of course now we'reÂ Â 

19:24
like a year on I'm now armed with a much FullerÂ 
picture of what happened what what the truth mightÂ Â  really be and so my legal team as you rememberÂ 
included a very straightforward yes or noÂ Â 

19:34
question back to them back to the couple in goodÂ 
faith regarding the girl in the communion photoÂ Â  I rewrote this number four is the little girlÂ 
pictured in the communion photograph allegedlyÂ Â 

19:45
from 1963 the brijit mcon that is currentlyÂ 
married to president mcon you guys know whatÂ Â 

19:52
happens next no response no response they're angryÂ 
you said it was recolored you said Brit trug noÂ Â 

19:58
had died when she was a child that's defamationÂ 
that's AFF information but we can't tell youÂ Â 

20:06
what the truth is They Knew by then in terms ofÂ 
how specific my questions were getting they knewÂ Â 

20:12
that I was on to them that I had worked throughÂ 
the investigation that I had arrived at moreÂ Â  correct conclusions that I was doing less musingÂ 
okay not for a single second did we believe thatÂ Â 

20:21
they were going to answer our questions and theyÂ 
have not yet they just send us more letters andÂ Â  more ridiculous things where they don't assertÂ 
what the truth actually is now regarding theÂ Â 

20:31
second photo of Brit's alleged childhood which theÂ 
documentary presented let's take a look at it soÂ Â 

20:36
you can understand what was so explosive aboutÂ 
it uh this uh full family trogo uh family trnoÂ Â 

20:43
photo um of them in Aman okay observations againÂ 
were immediately made by the public people areÂ Â 

20:49
allowed to think they are allowed to have thoughtsÂ 
they are allowed to ask questions okay first andÂ Â 

20:55
foremost people thought they were being told thatÂ 
b is this little girl in the lap of her motherÂ Â 

21:01
sitting here in the front but the public justÂ 
quickly taking a glance here thought wait a secondÂ Â 

21:09
bit looks more like that little boy on the farÂ 
left and wait a second who is that little boy inÂ Â 

21:15
the far left he's completely unaccounted for thusÂ 
far okay leading up to this moment despite so muchÂ Â 

21:22
press surrounding brigit her life her married lifeÂ 
her being a teacher despite entire genealogicalÂ Â 

21:30
websites that were dedicated to her family thereÂ 
was no mention on these genealogical websites orÂ Â 

21:36
in the Press of the boy on the far left okay soÂ 
that became the dog that wasn't barking okay forÂ Â 

21:44
clarity there had been only one brother that wasÂ 
publicly accounted for Brit's older brother we'llÂ Â 

21:49
show you a picture again he is the one standingÂ 
in the back that is Jean Claude and the interestedÂ Â 

21:56
public were now being introduced suddenly to aÂ 
second mysterious brother and they would find outÂ Â 

22:01
that his name was Jean Michelle trog no going toÂ 
take a brief pause here before I bring in EmanuelÂ Â 

22:10
marron's strange story first just to throw itÂ 
to one of our amazing sponsors pre-born becauseÂ Â 

22:16
if you want to hear some great news the abortionÂ 
pill reversal treatment which provides women withÂ Â  a second opportunity to choose is bringing babiesÂ 
back to life when you join forces with pre-bornÂ Â 

22:24
Ministries you Empower women to reverse the curseÂ 
but you might not be aware of is that even thoughÂ Â  row was overturned and abortion has been greatlyÂ 
restricted in many states the abortion pill hasÂ Â 

22:35
superseded surgical abortions accounting nowÂ 
for over 60% of all abortions pre-born networkÂ Â

securely by visiting preborn dcom Candace againÂ

23:14
about Field of Greens because the Dems spent yearsÂ 
forcing mandates and dictating how we manage ourÂ Â 

23:19

to take control of it ourselves and that's whyÂ Â 

23:24
you need to reclaim your own health with FieldÂ

and you use my code Candice that's field ofÂ Â 

24:06
greens.com cod Candice all right guys we're justÂ 
um warming up again feels like we're falling downÂ Â 

24:13
a hole I'm not sure why it's weird and again theseÂ 
are all these are all mainstream journalists so IÂ Â 

24:18
don't know what I did wrong here by presenting itÂ 
to the world so that they could see that somethingÂ Â  weird has been going on in France for quiteÂ 
some time and rather than the public ratherÂ Â 

24:28
the mainstream media being interested in it theyÂ 
just keep smearing everybody as like far-rightÂ Â  conspiracy theorists what every journalist I'veÂ 
mentioned thus far is on the left in fact manyÂ Â 

24:37
of these people were excited about giving brigitÂ 
a platform because they themselves are feministsÂ Â 

24:43
feminists and finally they said let me profileÂ 
this woman and then they realized something isÂ Â  very wrong here something I cannot why am I beingÂ 
called in to the El Palace what have I done wrongÂ Â 

24:54
why does this feel like a police interrogationÂ 
I'm just trying to ask some questionsÂ Â  but it's not just frit now let's discuss EmanuelÂ 
macron's biography because it's pretty interestingÂ Â 

25:05
pretty interesting this guy so The Story Goes thatÂ 
he like Brit was born in Aman Aman is the capitalÂ Â 

25:14
town or city within the department of Som okayÂ 
so in France they call these departments I likeÂ Â 

25:21
to think of departments as States if you're fromÂ 
America and uh so think of uh Aman as the capitalÂ Â 

25:28
capital of the state of Psalm Aman also has a tonÂ 
of History getting back to the Middle Ages becauseÂ Â 

25:34
it is the ancient capital of picardi which justÂ 
to be clear that just means like northern FranceÂ Â 

25:40
I'm telling you that for a reason now jumpingÂ 
back into his biography I am now going to readÂ Â 

25:46
directly from journalist Xavier P's forthcomingÂ 
book which we should be announcing for you guysÂ Â 

25:52
this week he writes quote Emmanuel m gred remainsÂ 
a mystery to those who went to school with him hisÂ Â 

26:02
former classmates describe him as quote the onlyÂ 
one we didn't know anything about neither where heÂ Â 

26:09
spent his vacations nor what his parents did forÂ 
a living they describe him as a loner not muchÂ Â 

26:15
socialized not Gathering others around him laterÂ 
at the school Henry IV he stayed in the backgroundÂ Â 

26:24
elusive quote he maintained an air of M a parallelÂ 
life of which we knew nothing no one knows of anyÂ Â 

26:33
close friends among his 48 fellow students he hadÂ 
a very striking chameleon likee manner end quoteÂ Â 

26:42
Emanuel macron's early life before he met brijitÂ 
is similarly a black hole journalists who haveÂ Â 

26:48
tried to cover the subject of all Fallen back onÂ 
Cross portraits for lack of material testimonialsÂ Â 

26:54
photographs Etc the information that could beÂ 
gathered can be summed up in in a few linesÂ Â 

27:00
Xavier goes on and says born on December 21st 1977Â 
in Aman Emanuel macron spent his childhood on RuÂ Â 

27:08
gotier de rili the street in Henryville whichÂ 
is the upscale District of Aman in a house thatÂ Â 

27:15
was bought in 1982 by his parents parentsÂ 
Jean Michelle macron a neuropsychiatrist atÂ Â 

27:24
Aman University Hospital from a Picard family andÂ 
franois no that would be his mother a pediatricianÂ Â 

27:31
who became an expert for Social Security justÂ 
going to pause before I jump into Exavier scriptÂ Â 

27:36
here so we get the picture okay his dad is aÂ 
psychiatrist his mom is a doctor to ChildrenÂ Â 

27:43
interesting combo that's all I'm saying that'sÂ 
all I'm saying for right now but I'm going toÂ Â  say a lot more her family originates from andÂ 
this is franois no his mother from bag uh andÂ Â 

27:56
that is in the hot ping n region I'm going to talkÂ 
about that later the couple had two more childrenÂ Â 

28:02
so Emanuel born in 1977 then came Laurent born inÂ 
1979 his brother and Estelle his sister born inÂ Â 

28:12
1982 all born within 5 years of one another bothÂ 
Physicians before divorcing in 2010 Emanuel macronÂ Â 

28:22
also has a half brother his name is Gabriel heÂ 
was born in 2005 from his father's second marriageÂ Â 

28:28
to a woman named Helen Jolie also a psychiatristÂ 
at The Institute of educational medicine in PSMÂ Â 

28:39
okay now in 2017 Emanuel mcon released his ownÂ 
autobiography which was entitled Revolution okayÂ Â 

28:49
that similarly provided very few scant detailsÂ 
about his background and it was actually SylvieÂ Â 

28:56
bmel an independent journalist who writes forÂ 
Vanity Fair again we aren't on Reddit threadsÂ Â 

29:01
guys we're not on the Deep Web who summed up hisÂ 
autobiography this way this is what she said aboutÂ Â 

29:06
his autobiography in Revolution Emmanuel devotesÂ 
five pages to his maternal grandmother only oneÂ Â 

29:15
to his parents and two lines to his brotherÂ 
Lorent and his sister Estelle nor is thereÂ Â 

29:22
any mention of his half brother Gabriel born inÂ 
2005 from his father's second marriage marriageÂ Â 

29:28
and even less of his father's companion HelenÂ 
conversely he scrupulously mentions the firstÂ Â 

29:35
names of Brit's three children and their spousesÂ 
as well as those of her seven grandchildren sheÂ Â 

29:42
has since had an eighth one on the day of theÂ 
inauguration the oier were the only ones to treadÂ Â 

29:48
the red carpet leading up to the El Palace toneÂ 
and Laurence blonde slim and elegant and theirÂ Â 

29:55
brother Sebastian all accompanied by their spouseÂ 
and their children the estrangement is reciprocalÂ Â 

30:02
in 2014 a colleague of his brother Lorent at theÂ 
hospital asked him if mcon working with FrancoisÂ Â 

30:09
haland at the time at the El Palace was a closeÂ 
relative no he's a vague cousin everyone's buggingÂ Â 

30:16
me about this guy replied his brother LorentÂ 
okay maybe maybe Loren just didn't want to beÂ Â 

30:23
asked about a question about a minister and justÂ 
said that weird then a woman named Nicole who isÂ Â 

30:31
a a first cousin of emanuel's Mother FrancisÂ 
no similarly told a reporter that she hardlyÂ Â 

30:37
ever saw Emmanuel's alleged sister Estelle that'sÂ 
very weird Okay Sylvie Bell again the journalistÂ Â 

30:46
Vanity Fair writer reputable mainstream mediaÂ 
also said this she said quote I had a hard timeÂ Â 

30:53
finding emanuel's friends he never talked aboutÂ 
his family we are hard pressed to find any photosÂ Â 

31:00
of his early years when as a grown-up he launchedÂ 
his presidential campaign many political analystsÂ Â 

31:06
noted that his Communications were inspired byÂ 
Obama even if this is the case he has neglectedÂ Â 

31:12
his early childhood anyone interested in theÂ 
former United States President Obama can have withÂ Â 

31:18
emotion at baby Barack in a romper suit the chubbyÂ 
kid wielding his first baseball bat the kid withÂ Â 

31:24
two holes where he just lost his baby teeth andÂ 
short watching him grow up our president's photoÂ Â 

31:31
album begins in his 10th year the shot was takenÂ 
in the choir of the Chapel of the law ProvidenceÂ Â 

31:38
school with Emanuel reading a passage from theÂ 
Bible around his neck a shiny Meadow worn forÂ Â  the first time marks the day of his baptism atÂ 
age 12 franois and Jean Michelle have a distantÂ Â 

31:50
relationship with religion of course they wereÂ 
married in a church to enjoy the pump of the eventÂ Â  and gather their families they never consideredÂ 
having the baby baptized wow Life Starts at theÂ Â 

32:01
age of 12 in photos that's a bit weird here areÂ 
the three photos she's referring to by the wayÂ Â  which were widely considered to be the firstÂ 
known photos of Emanuel mccrone one that she'sÂ Â 

32:12
describing from his baptism one from his seventhÂ 
grade year at providance and the third which isÂ Â 

32:19
another one from his studies it's almost like heÂ 
grew up in the Provident school with brigit rightÂ Â 

32:24
uhoh this going to be a quote and I'm going to getÂ 
a letter from Emanuel she said he grew up in theÂ Â  school that didn't happen we're suing you forÂ 
defamation oddly however I should mention thatÂ Â 

32:33
when Xavier pisard kept digging he did findÂ 
that there were some uncredited and seeminglyÂ Â 

32:38
unauthorized photos that appeared in you guessedÂ 
it Paris match one of uh Mimi maran's favoriteÂ Â 

32:44
Publications in May of 2017 when we know MimiÂ 
marshand the pr killer so to speak um figurativelyÂ Â 

32:53
was uh running comms for them so in May of 20Â 
2017 these photos appeared and I'm going to showÂ Â 

33:01
you those okay so we're seeing a kid it tellsÂ 
us in the captions that this is Emanuel macronÂ Â 

33:09
when he was 3 years old by the way if you guysÂ 
are French and watching this if somebody couldÂ Â  identify those sneakers that would be amazingÂ 
later on in the comments I'll get a closeup ofÂ Â 

33:17
that for you guys I'm just curious as to like whatÂ 
sneaker brand that is it says he's he's readingÂ Â 

33:23
Sylvester and Tweety have this crazy blonde hairÂ 
and that one at the bottom right is supposed toÂ Â 

33:28
be him at his father's um office of medicine andÂ 
you'll notice that again these young photos he'sÂ Â 

33:35
got all of these siblings there's no photos of himÂ 
with his siblings and who authorized these photosÂ Â  they're literally not credited in that magazineÂ 
issue of where these photos came from and theyÂ Â 

33:45
are never again included in any biography whetherÂ 
um it's autobiography whether it's an authorizedÂ Â 

33:52
biography or an unauthorized biography weÂ 
don't get to see those photos again okayÂ Â 

33:58
so to recap the macron side of the family isÂ 
supposed to have deep roots in Aman okay they'reÂ Â 

34:04
supposed to be picardi yet when another journalistÂ 
a gay journalist named Herve alga loranda and whyÂ Â 

34:11
I'm telling you he's gay and openly gay uh is notÂ 
to call him out but because don't forget a bigÂ Â 

34:17
piece of what the media says is that everybody'sÂ 
lgbtq phobic that's the reason why anybody is evenÂ Â 

34:22
saying anything about her well this guy certainlyÂ 
is not okay Herve alal laranda made what is likelyÂ Â 

34:29
the greatest effort to look into Emanuel macron'sÂ 
upbringing in his investigative book uh which inÂ Â 

34:34
English is two young French women okay and heÂ 
similarly found some really odd things foremostÂ Â 

34:43
the former mayor of Aman A man's named G de robanÂ 
I'm showing you him right there who was close withÂ Â 

34:50
the trogo family because Aman is close-knit andÂ 
therefore in no way was trying to shade them orÂ Â 

34:55
harm them in any way said this about Emanuel MaconÂ 
he said maon is not amena he is tuet meaning he'sÂ Â 

35:04
not like from the town of Aman he's like fromÂ 
louet which is L is a Seaside town in FranceÂ Â 

35:13
what did he mean by that what do you mean he'sÂ 
a a tedan is he suggesting that macron was wasÂ Â 

35:19
not from Aman at all because that would be weirdÂ 
why wouldn't a city mayor in which the presidentÂ Â 

35:25
of France was born in want to take full creditÂ 
for his birth like yes Emanuel cron is for fromÂ Â 

35:32
here maybe he just meant that he spent more ofÂ 
his time or the most of his time outside of theÂ Â 

35:38
city I don't know what he meant by this but heÂ 
said it at least according to that book surelyÂ Â 

35:44
they would want to claim them right but peopleÂ 
even called into question macron's interest inÂ Â 

35:50
his own birthplace of Aman because um from thatÂ 
very same book we find out that Emanuel mcon quoteÂ Â 

35:58
skipped the commemoration while he was in officeÂ 
of the Centenary of the battle of Aman on AugustÂ Â 

36:04
8th 2018 the Amon born mrrone was conspicuouslyÂ 
absent while Teresa may then the prime minister ofÂ Â 

36:11
the United Kingdom and Prince William one of QueenÂ 
Elizabeth's grandsons were present the English hadÂ Â 

36:16
stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the French in theÂ 
battle of the world of World War I the start ofÂ Â 

36:21
the Allies Victorious offensive Emanuel mccroneÂ 
did not attend the celebration even though hisÂ Â 

36:27
family's birthplace aie it's another city was onÂ 
the front line of another famous battle the battleÂ Â 

36:32
of s and the castle housed a field Hospital evenÂ 
though he knows full well as he has mentioned inÂ Â 

36:39
several speeches that picardi still Bears theÂ 
scars of the wars against Germany okay maybeÂ Â 

36:45
he was busy that day let's not get too crazy alsoÂ 
I should mention that before Emanuel had enteredÂ Â 

36:50
the political scene in 2012 he had consideredÂ 
running for municipal office but never in theÂ Â 

36:56
bicardi region only only in P de Cal which isÂ 
further North that's the same P de Cal that bikÂ Â 

37:03
worked within as a press secretary maybe that'sÂ 
why maybe they were already in the midst of theirÂ Â  Affair I'm not sure and then it's just about toÂ 
get outright embarrassing okay when you considerÂ Â 

37:13
the massive blunder that gets made by PresidentÂ 
Emanuel macron in regards to the other side ofÂ Â 

37:19
his family Roots the no right his mom side ranÂ 
no is his mom from suaz no is his mom rememberÂ Â 

37:26
her family traces back back to the town of hotÂ 
that is a region of Pyrenees okay think of theÂ Â 

37:33
Pyrenees Mountains basically they border SpainÂ 
and France so there's a lot of different spokenÂ Â 

37:40
languages a few different spoken languages in thatÂ 
region historically so mccrone in his presidentialÂ Â 

37:46
capacity goes to visit Andor in 2018 and heÂ 
presents himself as a child of the P of of theÂ Â 

37:53
Pyrenees okay and this exchange happen betweenÂ 
him and a corsac national official his name wasÂ Â 

38:01
Xavier Luciani and it was captured this exchangeÂ 
was captured by a journalist from Express magazineÂ Â 

38:08
because you know in president's travel they haveÂ 
like the pool of journalists that travel with themÂ Â  and they're recording and they're listening to theÂ 
conversations and he's speaking to this andoranÂ Â 

38:20
guy and the journalist writes that mcon said thisÂ 
quote I had great grandparents who were bordonÂ Â 

38:27
they only spoke penan their sole aim in lifeÂ 
was that my grandmother would attend a stateÂ Â 

38:36
school to learn French think about it end quoteÂ 
so he's opening up here now we know he was closeÂ Â 

38:43
to his grandmother he wrote the most aboutÂ 
his grandmother um in his book The RepublicÂ Â 

38:48
and he's saying that his grandmother like he theÂ 
sole aim of her parents was for his grandmotherÂ Â 

38:57
to stop speaking penan and to go to a school andÂ 
learn French go to a state school and learn FrenchÂ Â 

39:05
and he goes think about it think about how amazingÂ 
now he's a president of France and that was allÂ Â 

39:10
his great grandparents wanted for his belovedÂ 
grandmother and you know what that politicianÂ Â  did think about it probably not for very longÂ 
because it turns out that penan is not and hasÂ Â 

39:20
never been a language it's just amazing that is isÂ 
just amazing no never bit of language they didn'tÂ Â 

39:31
know what the heck he was talking about they'reÂ 
going what are you talking about peran what isÂ Â  that that's not a thing people here speak a bunchÂ 
of different languages and that's not one of themÂ Â 

39:38
it's oxyon catalon nobody speaks penan what areÂ 
you trying to say man so he just made up a pieceÂ Â 

39:46
of his childhood so that was weird that was realÂ 
weird man real weird to be emotionally attachedÂ Â 

39:52
to a language that never existed anyways uhÂ 
back to the journalist Herve GA lorando heÂ Â 

39:58
tried desperately thereafter to speak to anyoneÂ 
in the macron family but they were as thick asÂ Â  thieves okay he got shot down shot down shot downÂ 
then there was an official in boray who gave himÂ Â 

40:10
an idea okay and the idea that came across hisÂ 
mind was you know what I should actually I wantÂ Â 

40:15
to learn about Emanuel macron's history I shouldÂ 
speak to Brit weird right the reason why this ideaÂ Â 

40:21
popped into his mind was that that official toldÂ 
him that when Emanuel mrrone had visited bagayÂ Â 

40:27
okay another city out of Civility he was makingÂ 
conversation and he asked Emanuel macron aboutÂ Â  his sister Estelle because she lived nearby andÂ 
he says that apparently Emanuel Marron turned toÂ Â 

40:39
Brit to know what to answer he turned to his wifeÂ 
to know what to answer about his sister I don'tÂ Â 

40:51
know about how you guys are feeling right now butÂ 
I'm starting to get a little icky feeling it'sÂ Â  it's all starting to feel a bit incestuous to meÂ 
you know like why she knows so much and why is heÂ Â 

41:00
like more into her family I don't know it's veryÂ 
weird right we she probably paused there but forÂ Â 

41:05
fun I am going to tease you with these this photoÂ 
two photos and I want you guys to know this isÂ Â 

41:11
this is real this is not made up okay because nextÂ

son named Jean Jack who is not missing John jackÂ Â 

41:37

a side by side of Jean Jack and Emanuel macronÂ Â 

41:44
okay and here's another one of Jean Jack and EmanÂ 
mcon now these two are not related okay one on theÂ Â 

41:51
left is allegedly Brit who claims she is not JeanÂ 
Michelle trno that's that's allegedly bit's nephewÂ Â

mrrone side of the family okay this is Bri thisÂ Â
