## Summary

[[Dr. Jack Kruse]] delivers a provocative critique of modern medicine, blending [[Quantum Biology]] with controversial claims about [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|DARPA]], mind control, and the military-industrial complex. [[Dr. Jack Kruse|Kruse]] argues that centralized medicine fails to understand how humans function in relation to natural forces—light, magnetism, and electricity—leading to widespread chronic diseases. He integrates his health protocols (e.g., Leptin Prescription, [[Cold thermogenesis]]) with assertions about government suppression of scientific discoveries and mind control technologies, positioning his work as a rebellion against a controlled medical narrative. The discussion spans quantum biology, bioelectrics, and conspiratorial claims, urging listeners to reclaim health through environmental alignment.

### Key Concepts Discussed

1. Quantum Biology and Health Optimization (00:00:00–00:18:23, Making America Healthy; 03:03:50, How the Human Body Creates Light):
    
    - [[Jack Kruse, MD|Kruse]] frames health as a quantum process, with mitochondria acting as [[Semiconductors]] that harness sunlight, water, and magnetism for energy production. He emphasizes light-driven processes (e.g., UV light regulating DHA and leptin pathways) and critiques modern lifestyles—artificial light, EMFs, processed foods—for disrupting mitochondrial redox potential, causing diseases like obesity and cancer.
    - Protocols include morning sunlight exposure (20–30 minutes) to reset circadian rhythms via [[Melanopsin]], [[Cold thermogenesis]] to boost mitochondrial efficiency, and the Epi-Paleo diet (high-fat, DHA-rich foods like seafood) to optimize cellular signaling.
        
2. Bioelectrics and [[Robert O Becker|Robert Becker]]’s Influence (00:18:23, [[Robert O Becker|Dr. Becker]] & the Body’s Electric Current):
    
    - Kruse cites [[Robert O Becker]]’s research, showing that bones and tissues act as semiconductors, emitting light and using electric currents for regeneration (e.g., salamander limb regrowth). Becker’s work, allegedly suppressed by the government, supports Kruse’s claim that bioelectric fields govern health and are disrupted by EMFs like Wi-Fi and [[5G]].
        
3. Leptin Prescription and Hormonal Health (00:25:41, DHA & Leptin Pathways):
    
    - Leptin resistance, driven by blue light and circadian misalignment, underlies metabolic disorders. Kruse’s Leptin Prescription involves a high-protein, high-fat breakfast (50–75g protein), minimal snacking, carb timing at night, and evening exercise to restore leptin sensitivity, aligning with Gulhane’s and Bennett’s emphasis on circadian health.

4. Blue Light as a Weapon (00:36:04, MK-ULTRA’s Blue Light Weapon; 03:21:31, Blue Light & Testosterone):
    
    - Kruse alleges that blue light from screens, linked to DARPA and MK-ULTRA, depletes dopamine and disrupts melatonin, acting as a mind control tool by altering brain function. He recommends blue-blocking glasses and red light therapy (03:09:37, Red Light Can Repair Vision) to counteract these effects, supported by studies on blue light’s impact on testosterone and sleep.

5. [[Cold thermogenesis]] and Mitochondrial Efficiency (03:37:30, Why the Human Body Works Better in Cold):
    
    - Cold exposure (e.g., 5–10 minute cold showers at 50–60°F) activates brown fat, upregulates uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), and enhances fat burning. Kruse, echoed by Dahhaj, emphasizes morning [[Cold thermogenesis]] with sunlight for metabolic synergy, supported by research on cold-induced insulin sensitivity.
        
6. DARPA and Mind Control Allegations (00:36:04–01:35:14, MK-ULTRA’s Blue Light Weapon, The NEW MK-Ultra):
    
    - Kruse claims DARPA and the military-industrial complex use technologies like blue light, microwaves, and optogenetics for mind control, citing the “Marshmello experiment” (00:43:38) and a mysterious nuclear medical device (01:00:11). He links these to historical MK-ULTRA projects and alleges suppression of Becker’s research to control scientific narratives.
        
7. Conspiracy and Power Structures (00:28:35, Who Built Las Vegas; 01:35:14–01:49:18, Funding Black Operations, Why the Deep State Hates [[Donald Trump|Trump]]):
    
    - Kruse connects the Jewish mob, Mossad, and the military-industrial complex to Las Vegas’s origins, alleging they fund black operations through hidden financial networks. He claims the “deep state” opposes figures like Trump for disrupting these structures, tying health suppression to broader control mechanisms.
    
8. Neuroplasticity and Unconventional Medicine (03:48:07, Neuroplasticity; 02:46:20, Methylene Blue):
    
    - Kruse discusses neuroplasticity, using methylene blue and unconventional brain surgery techniques (e.g., 20-hour surgeries, 02:42:43) to enhance brain function. He claims the body emits light for cellular communication, repairable via red light therapy, aligning with Bennett’s practical applications.
        
9. Case Studies and Personal Insights (02:28:42, Saving Rick Rubin’s Life; 02:30:54, Dealing with Death as a Neurosurgeon):
    
    - Kruse recounts saving music producer Rick Rubin’s life using quantum biology principles and reflects on death’s impact as a neurosurgeon, emphasizing environmental health interventions over drugs

## Transcript:

All right [[Dr. Jack Kruse]] wow those are some wild sung classes you got are those what kind of glasses are those those black blue light blue light glasses yeah those are pretty cool looking y also I love your hat make America healthy again yeah just just picked that up in Dallas from uh Nicole Shanahan oh yeah yeah you we were just talking off camera how you just came from Dallas what were you doing there uh doing some work with both of them about uh current events current events about [[Donald Trump]] getting shot the day we did our Our Big Gig there with the uh Council of the cancelled you know I was there with Andy Wakefield who you may know from the vaccine story he was cancelled in 1998 about the MMR vaccine and I was there with um Mary Bowen who is uh an ENT surgeon that was just cancelled by the state of Texas she lost her ability to practice and then she fought then she fought the FDA and then me because I've been a renegade for pretty much 20 years they've been coming after me to try to shut me up so so okay for people that aren't aware of you um can you give me just sort of like a brief background of where you come from and what your expertise is yeah well where I come from is New York City but where I practice is predominantly in the South part of the United States when I was 40 years old about 20 years ago I had an Awakening that everything that we're doing in in centralized medicine was wrong and um then something happened to me where it kind of woke me up and um I was given a talk at a I guess a minimally invasive spine meeting in Birmingham Alabama and I needed help to get it to the podium because I I tore a NE miniscus on my knee just from standing up and one of the orthop pic surgeons wives are there and she worked for um a biotechnology company she goes I know why this happened to you and she goes I'm going to send you you know six papers and and a book and I want you to read the book first and you can figure it out from there what she was trying to tell me at that time is that big Pharma you know was cooking the books and it was about a hormone called [[Leptin]] was relatively new at the time I didn't didn't even learn about it in medical school because it was discovered after I graduated and they shelv the trials and what she was trying to tell me at that time um was that big farmer was going to do something to kind of scam the public you know ruin the Public's health and they when they canceled the trials they immediately went out and started to uh patent cold receptors and do some really bizarre things and she knew there was something nefarious going on and she said look my husband says you're a pretty smart guy you probably figure it out and now was actually the story that she wanted me to figure out but I went a totally different way with it the book she gave me was kind of interesting it's a feble it's called the the monk who sold his Ferrari by Robin charma and in that book the monk who sold his Ferrari yeah the monk who sold his Ferrari uh it's a good book it's a fable it's not true story but she wanted me to read that U because the story in there was important for the paper she sent me it was about a guy named Julian B is a Jewish lawyer in New York has a heart attack um he's a train wreck you know he's low dopamine overweight an you know the classic you know stereotype of a New Yorker and um he quits sells his Ferrari and goes up to the top of the Himalayan mountains comes back a year later tan thin and actually filled with wisdom and actually a nice guy and he comes back you know to his old world and this and that and um then gives me the papers and I read the papers and I thought she was trying to tell me is what was in the book possible that's not what she was trying to tell me she was trying to warn me that they shoved the lepon trials because they had a New Drug in development they wanted me to talk about it and um that's not what happened so this is now six years after this after I figured out that everything that I learned in medical school was not true it's really based on you know quantum mechanics the physics of organisms are the key circadian biology is the key like uh we are decentralized meaning that there's no Central controller um that's not what they teach you in medical school it's not what they teach you in residency but then six or seven years later after talking to several people who knew her I knew what she wanted me to talk about so I decided to do a TED talk about that very issue and the Ted Talk got canceled uh it was how does a TED Talk get canceled to get shut down on YouTube or whatever well it was big farmers shut it down oh wow and um the reason why has a lot to do you know what was in the book and you know you know current events now you know about OIC you know about the glp1 drugs what you don't know is that this was all preconditioned by the FDA in big Pharma in 1974 we had sacran uh 19 77 you have uh high fructose corn serum all of those are glp Agonist just so you know that so they have known about this and the FDA when the the last little bit was in I believe in '89 they approve sucros which is you know Splenda right and Splenda was only supposed to be in certain uh foods and drinks and then they expanded it to pretty much anything that's uh you know a processed food and that's one of the reasons why processed food is really bad for you because it's got an Agonist for glp1 so it's designed to make you fat and then if you have um I guess the best way to put it if you have an indoor existence which we all now have I mean you're a young guy you don't remember what it was like you know when I was 20 years old nobody was inside nobody had technology no one had a microwave oven no one had a cell phone and Technology the one thing that it's done it's brought all the silly talking monkeys inside they're no longer outside like kids rode bikes they played when you grow up you're playing video games we didn't have any video games and it turns out that the non-native EMF which is what blue light is married with these changes that have happened in food was the story of [[Leptin]] so I decided CU where I was going the first six years of this more on the light story more on the other doctor that got cancelled for the non [[Non-Native Electromagnetic Fields|EMF]] story which is a guy named [[Robert O Becker]] he's a orthopedic surgeon so is this the guy who worked for [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|DARPA]] well he didn't work for DARPA I heard cuz I read a book called from uh this lady who I'm friends with Annie Jacobson she wrot a book called the pentagon's brain she wrote this deep story on the history of [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|DARPA]] and some of the scientists that work for it and she talks about this re this limb regeneration guy who was trying to figure out limb G regeneration for soldiers yeah he figured it out but the bad problem is when he figured it out he actually figured out a that and a whole lot more and why he got cancelled in fact that's the reason I just went to talk to you know Kennedy and and Shanahan because his story is tied to [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|DARPA]] but it's also tied to the assassination it's tied to how science was stolen Becker is in the generation right after the science is stolen and the way the science was stolen initially starts that story starts in 1944 really in 42 that's the[[ Manhattan Project]] with [[General Leslie Groves]] right and FDR and general Groves got the idea let me finish the other story because we're jumping all over the place here so anyway the glp1 drugs get approved by the FDA so the FDA basically just created a market this is like preconditioning the all of the United States to have this problem with obesity now right people say there there wasn't a huge problem there but if you listen to like some of the tweets that Bobby puts out uh when [[Anthony Fauci|fauci]] got put in 82 uh what the issue was with obesity it was nowhere where it is now but you need to realize that these things actually happened even before [[Anthony Fauci|fauci]] gets in and then you have federal agencies that are already captured preconditioning the market then you add in blue screen technology which is what DARPA gives Google that's Sur J Brin and Larry pagee and you know the chick that just died from Turbo cancer with YouTube how you know her name Susan uh oh Susan that former CEO yes she's she's one of the founders of Google and you have to realize that Nicole knows all these people that she was married to Sergey Bren so many of the things that you know I'm here literally two days after talking to them about all this um they were stunned and the story with the Ted Talk is I basically went up there to tell people that this lept and Milano courton pathway is exactly what the FDA and big farmer were up to and then eventually CU When this talk was canceled it's 2010 2011 this is five or six years after I have my come to Jesus moment at the foot of Michelangelo statue so I decide I'm going to you know drop this nuclear weapon literally within a week I have the FBI and uh State Medical Board everybody coming after me and they talk to the people at Ted and they pull the Ted Talk the Ted Talk was pulled for almost 10 years to bury the story and you remember you didn't know anything about glp1 drugs no well nobody did until they came out like four years ago so the reason why this is important I was cancelled before covid because of this issue and if you don't think this is a big issue I mean just look at the you know the 13k from Novo Nordisk it's a trillion dollar drug so when you begin to realize that light water and magnetism those are the three things that NASA or seti uses you know to try to find life on another planet those are the things that are tied to the decentralized network you know that life uses on this planet and the glp one system that they're working with destroys the lepton Milano courton pathway and this is the reason why many of the chronic diseases that you hear Bobby talk about you know and all the all the surrogates that were in his program before you know he joined with [[Donald Trump|Trump]] like you remember the day we were just talking about the guy that you're having in here you remember when Bobby gave that talk he mentioned the word mighty calri well what I call my people mitochondri mitochondriac yeah so you may understand where this linkage is and then through the covid things that was another big story that I'm sure we'll get into down the pike but I started posting a lot of things through Co being even more controversial and everybody was saying well how's [[Dr. Jack Kruse|Jack Kruse]] able to post this stuff on Twitter when every other doctors getting cancelled why does he get cancelled right people didn't know that one of my patients was Jack dorsy and oh really correct so dorsy owned Twitter at that time and he told everybody you're not canceling him he follows he's followed all my stuff because of problems that he had with tech abuse starting in 2010 so this is right back at the the time the Ted Talk is pulled so this is now when the shots start to come out the mandates come out and president buchelli in El Salvador notices within two or three months that they're having huge problems with the jab and he tells his guys in his administration go find this doctor go find the neurosurgeon from the United States that's saying all this stuff and one of the things that I said that people need to avoid taking this JB because I reviewed the patents and I noticed in the fizer patent specifically um we there was a movie that was held off on the side it's called covid revealed me Malone and Mulla were in this documentary and uh in there I told people that there's two legal definitions one for the fiser jab and another one for Bio entech I said there's only one reason they would do that and it's nefarious the reason I believed is they were going to use one to get through the FDA approval process but then the other one was going to be what they Unleashed on the people and I had an inkling at the time that the problem is going to be related to sv40 the reason for that ties back to the story that that I was telling you before when I walked in the room is the cutter event what happened with the [[Polio Vaccine]] in Jonas suon 1951 through 1957 and I happen to know about that in a very circuitous way because of where I did my residency did my residency at LSU then and did medical Schooler and and my nurse surgery residency and if you know anything about the cutter event uh the City of New Orleans was tied to this event in a big way and I just went to Dallas to tell you know Shanahan and and uh Bobby the whole detail of the story and Bobby and I did a podcast with Rick Rubin about a year and a half ago about this issue this is when he first jumped into the race and what people didn't know about at that time after I wrote this Constitutional Amendment for buelli I shared it with Bobby and I shared it with his healthc care attorney who's Aaron Siri and they called me back I don't know two or three weeks after that and said hey can we use several pages of this law as our platform for health care in the United States so I asked bu Kelly and he said yes so that's the reason why you've heard a lot of the stuff on there you know most people know Bobby is a an attorney he sued Monsanto got a ton of money you know and he's done things for the environment and all that but what I did the law that I gave him this is a funny story um when he gave the law to Aaron to look at Aaron calls me up and he's like Jack there's no way this law could get passed even by Ronda santis in Florida if you didn't know we record these ads about a week after we do the episode and ever since I talked to Jack about nicotine I've been trying to kick my zinh habit so I've since decided to kick the zins and switch over to Lucy which is not like any other nicotine pouch company that's owned by big tobacco they're so much better than zins they're like the mom and pop shop of pouches Lucy pouches come in all sorts of different flavors and strengths but their new product Lucy Breakers actually has this little bead of flavor that you can bite and break so when the flavor's wearing off all you got to do is bite the breaker to release an extra punch of flavor and hydration so when you order you can get a onetime order but you can set yourself up with a subscription and it's a lot cheaper if you do it that way and this is cool because it allows you to try a variety of different flavors my favorite is espresso Danny what's yours I love the espresso too Steve it's my favorite because in the morning if I'm on the go and don't have a free hand to hold a cup of coffee that espresso Lucy breaker packs the same punch as a tall cup of coffee I'll have to try cinnamon next that's up for next week I like Lucy better because I think their flavors are much better they come in three different strengths 4 eight and 12 plus they don't have that weird artificial flavor like Zen plus Zen doesn't have gum I prefer the gum on the golf course their gum is a hit check out how many stars they have it's almost five stars it's like five and five and a half five and 3/4 that's that's pretty good the gum is also great because it has three different strengths two four and 6 milligrams and it's way more light doesn't have that weird artificial flavor either if you've made it this far it's time to level up your nicotine routine with Lucy go to lucy. c/d Danny and use the promo code Danny to get 20% off your first order Lucy offers free shipping and has a 30-day refund policy if you change your mind that's luy doco and use the promo code Danny dny y for 20% off and it's always free shipping and here comes the fine print Lucy products are only for adults of legal age every order is age verified warning this product contains nicotine and nicotine is an addictive chemical it's linked below now back to the show he because it's that air tight it covers everything and when they decided to use it he says to me hey I'm going to start this run for president I I would like to do you know a podcast with you who's the person that sets this up turns out it's Nicole shanan this is before she is actually announced as the vice president why did she contact me because of her daughter Eko you know she's got a daughter with Sergey Bren that's got autism okay and she contacted me and she goes I've I've noticed that you have a totally different take on autism when in terms of the vaccines and um and light and I um you're probably now beginning to start to see that Becker's world and the vaccine World collide together and when I say collide together you are preconditioned By The Light in your germ line and then the vaccines are additive to it that cause the real problem and I said yeah I'm I'm into it and you have to realize since I consider Becker my mentor CU he was the guy who was immediately cancelled before me uh um I went still alive by the way no he's dead he died in 2009 okay uh but I I I just got finished telling Nicole when I was in Dallas that I actually physically sat down and talked to him about what I'm talking to you about now and he was the one that told me goes you need to understand what happened to me he goes you have to be very careful about who you're getting ready to go against and which was the Industrial military complex and and you know this guy was twice nominated for the Nobel Prize and literally he was so frustrated with you know a lot of the stuff that I'm sure you have heard in your life as a podcaster that most people think is conspiracy theory when it turns out it's really not it's the truth right he got frustrated and then in 1977 he goes on 60 Minutes and tells the world the problem with non-native EMF and you have to realize my friend non-native vmf yeah that's Wireless technology it's BL light screens it's fluorescent bulbs it's RF microwaves the whole shebang 1977 nobody has a microwave oven nobody has a cell phone and how did this problem with Becker kind of show up it shows up because the military wanted to build this antenna called sanguin in a lake in Wisconsin what was the purpose of the antenna in 73 so they could keep control of all the nuclear subs all over the world because right now they before that they couldn't do that mhm so they were building this thing and they hired Becker because of the stuff that you had just talked about that Becker was working on Lim regeneration and he found out that Lim regeneration uses the electromagnetic force to do it in other words the physics of regeneration is all based on semiconduction that's the thing that was shocking about him and how did I come upon his uh research as a resident at the same why did I know about all this stuff I'm a nurse surgery resident and I'm doing a lot of spine reconstructions well bone was the subject of Becker's work so my mentor in neurosurgery Dr David Klein said Jack I want you to do a project on bone regeneration I want you to use this guy's Becker work because what he found in 59 through 67 was absolutely shocking most people still don't believe that that's how it happens but I want you to present presented to the resident so that meant I had to go read all his papers mhm so I learned about this and you know most people who listen this podcast what I'm about to say won't believe this but it's aaic true you don't heal bone ever bone regenerates completely so for example if you break your arm right now and you go have surgery and the the orthopedic surgeon opens it up and looks for where your previous break was there's no scar really none it's one of the few tissues in man where that's the case you know most people know about it with the liver you can cut half a liver out and it'll grow back but we as mammals especially the end of the line mammals we don't have that ability in a lot of different areas so what does Becker do he does a bunch of work to figure out actually how this happens and it turns out we create a DC electric current in us that actually causes red blood cells in the marrow to dedifferentiate in other words a red cell becomes a bone cell and that is what heals the fracture and it completely regenerates it so that there's no scar so of course he writes all this stuff up then he finds out actually how this goes like collagen and appetite that are part of bone are actually semiconductive proteins he does experiments that show bone emitz light just like an LED diode and just remember this is going down in the 60s bro so that's how the military found out about Becker's work right okay and he was the expert like he was the [[Anthony Fauci]] of his time in bone regeneration he worked in the VA hospital in Syracuse so he had huge government contracts he was he was very very prolific so in 73 when the government comes to him they're like look we want to know will this antenna since it's going to use RF radiation does it have any biologic effects for the people in the military or the people that live around it [[Robert O Becker|Becker]] does the work uh with guys in his lab and he finds out it does he writes a report in 73 to the the secretary of the Navy and they were stunned with what he found and he kept writing reports the next thing he started to notice that all this stuff in the Federal Register never got published in other words the research my in but it never left DARPA and no one ever did about it so what did Becker decide to do now I don't know where you're from where your family's from but I'm originally from New York City at the same time we have a governor in New York named UK Cary they're trying to get electric power lines go from the city up to Niagara Falls to get more transmission lines so uh Becker starts doing some work on these power lines to prove to the military that that that freaking antenna in Wisconsin is a real problem and he does something that's to this day most people still don't know this you know they still think it's conspiracy theory yeah um that power lines can harm you but him and Marino who is the guy that was in his lab he's a biophysicist became a lawyer to defend Becker they did a study on 765 kilowatt towers that are everywhere even here in Florida Towers yeah no these are El remember there's no cells right okay yeah at this time these are electric towers for the power grid mhm they changed the Earth's magnosphere 80,000 kilometers above the surface of the Earth they proved this in 1974 7576 and not only did they rate the military not only did they give this information to UK carry they gave it to all the electric power companies and everybody was just like stunned okay so you have to remember this guy is he's like freaking Joe Montana of science at this time and no one is listening to him because why his message is very inconvenient it's a truth and it's a time where retooling our economy from an industrial economy to an information technology so the power Grid's a big deal the use of non-native EMF Intel Microsoft Google this is all the precursor stuff at this time the big company at that time which you probably know is IBM Believe It or Not IBM was already working on liquid Crystal and displays that was using a lot of this stuff and DARPA was involved in that too so darer and the military sucked [[Robert O Becker|Becker]] in they're fueling and fueling and fueling until the truth comes out what does he do 1977 he's so frustrated he gets on 60 Minutes and he tells the world the truth the he tells them exactly what I just told you when I said it to you your eyeballs got yeah you know really big because a lot of people even now 50 years later don't realize what he's really found is that all of this has biologic effects I don't care what it is like you put those apple things in your ear dude that's the stupidest thing you could ever do I stopped using them a few months ago I got the wired ones now yeah that's not good the wired ones probably aren't good no because you're still getting jump conduction into your ear which will bring you to my work my work is the next level of Becker like if Becker had lived mhm he would have looked for the source of the DC electric current well we found it what were you saying was the reason that Susan the former CEO of YouTube she had some sort of cancer you think it had something to do with this well I don't think I know okay um she she has a very interesting story her mother is named uh Esther Esther is known as the grandmother of Silicon Valley all the kids were tied oh wow to her that's what I said you need to really understand um the metrics that we're talking about and the reason why this is very interesting is because I'm entangled now to people like Nicole and people like Bobby Bobby didn't know this but Nicole does because she was married to Sergey prin so I when we started talking about this her and I obviously when she has a kid with autism she and she's a patent attorney for Google and I tell her no I'm not going to help you cuz you're the person that actually caused the problem and I have to tell you I was not a nice guy to her I mean brutal to her really oh yeah this is like probably a year and a half ago and she offered me at that time a $100 million to build a decentralized uh research facility with buelli down in El Salvador and I told her I said bro hold my beer I'm not doing this why cuz I don't trust you I know who you were married to I know things about Google I know things about what brin's all about I know this the story how it's tied to arpa DARPA the internet how you got the information and you and your husband are the reason why blue light exists on every screen in this country and that's what's getting your generation really sick that's really where the chronic disease epidemic begin cuz that that makes it way worse and when I told her a little bit of the story I said do you really know where DARPA the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and everybody got this information and then studied it and she said no I said well I'm going to tell you where ekko's autism comes from comes from the Jewish Mafia okay in the 1930s 1940s 1950s the names that you know uh Bugsy which they made a movie about uh MO Dallas who's the guy started Vegas and the big guy you're right here in Tampa so you should know a little bit about [[Meyer Lansky|Myer Lansky]] Myer Lansky yeah my trante correct well traic TR wasn't Jewish but no but traficante is really important because of how this ties in JFK yeah so you need to realize what happens is at that time because I know you know probably a lot of the story Cuban Revolution happens in 59 cubba comes in the Chicago mob who's friends with the guys in the Jewish mob through the Capone crime syndicate in in Chicago that was later taken over by um God what's his name Sam I'm blanking on his name yeah I know who you're talking about but anyway um they go boom in in Cuba they lose a lot of money who's the guy that's the accountant for this it's turns out that it's actually Meer Lans MH and who's the the shooter for all this is traic and they're based here in Florida so when that goes down Mo with Johnny Rosetti who's also part of the Hollywood scene they get together and mo says I got an idea let's go build a casino in a desert everybody thinks he's crazy at first okay so they build Vegas and it's like it makes more sense to them to go to a place what year is this this is uh 194 40s okay bu Casino the same place we're dropping all the nukes well but believe it or not that's where his idea came from if you're familiar with this podcast you know I've talked about Verso at nauseum on previous episodes because I've been using their product daily for almost a little over three years now but there's a totally new unexpected bonus you can get from Verso which is weight loss cell being by Verso isn't just about slowing down the aging process it's packed with research backed ingredients that also promote fat loss these ingredients have been proven in both animal and human studies to boost metabolism and improve body composition through a variety of body mechanisms one aspect is how these ingredients increase the body's process to break down fat and act as a calory restriction mimetic essentially fooling your body into thinking it's consuming fewer calories they also help regulate glucose and [[Leptin]] levels which suppress hunger and increased feelings of fullness effectively curbing Cravings I take cell being every morning to feel like a younger version of myself combating the signs of aging which is amazing on its own experiencing fat loss is just an added bonus and something I'm happy about plus Verso ensures transparency and quality by publishing third-party testing results for each batch they produce so you know you're getting exactly what you're paying for if you want to feel as good as I do and lose some weight at the same time head on over to the link below at v.o and use the coupon code Danny and you can get 15% off your first order again go to v.o and use the coupon code dny at checkout to save 15% off your first order it's linked below now back to the show he was like nobody will ever think that we can create the biggest racket in the world and uh just to for your audience because I'm a big history guy and I think you need to know all these bits and pieces cuz I know we're jumping around but do you know where the term laundering comes from uh no comes from modals comes from Bugsy it comes from Myer Lansky what they use the Jewish mob used laundromats to launder money to skim it to keep it away from the government oh wow yeah I think I have heard that before yeah so that's where this came from and then Mo and um Rosetti and [[Meyer Lansky|Myer Lansky]] they have the reputation that's very different than the Italian mob the Italian mob is kind of like guys that are going to shoot you up and it's it's kind of bloody these guys are much more reserved okay and they're like accountants they really care more about the money in the business being sustainable of a long time well they become very very successful in the 1940s so successful that something else is happening in the world that you probably know about uh Albert Einstein worked with General Grow in the [[Manhattan Project]] it's successful 1945 so in 1948 the Jewish state that was still not made yet offered Albert Einstein to be the first president and it turns out their military arm which is known as the Massad actually have Lansky and Dallas they're they're they're their guys in the United States okay lansi and who lansi and and modal really they were Massad agents here in the United States so what do they do they go to Vegas and they realize that there is no regulations it's the wild west they build it from the ground up everybody in Chicago and the Italian families are making fun of these Jewish guys doing this because they're not bringing in the bank like these guys are bringing in in Cuba 59 happens and guess what happens all the Italian guys get turned off they're losing millions of dollars and they're Furious so you know they hate Castro so what do they do they have the friends mo mo has been working for 12 13 years in the desert and what does MO do he steadily and slowly increases profits but guess what he does how does he do it does he shoot anybody up or do anything like that no the first thing he did is he put one arm bandits in all the casinos he blue lit everything why because he paid attention to how people spent money he realized when you used artificial light it seemed like people spent more money so then what's the second thing he does in like 1952 53 he starts painting all the windows in the casino Black so you can't see outside can't see outside and he doesn't want to go outside then that's the last thing he does gets rid of the clocks is that what he does he that the clocks were gone already okay but the best part is then he brings in girls scantily clad and he starts giving people alcohol while they Gamble and what does he basically do he creat an army of low dopamine idiots in the desert who they don't have to shoot they go into their pocket and pay all the money to so of course at this time now after grov is out he gets Truman to change the OSS to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] in 47 the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] knows exactly what uh Dallas is doing and they know that they're they're avoiding taxes so they decide we need to go find out is there any science behind any of this stuff so where are we right now 48 51 52 so you may have heard of this program called [[Project MK-Ultra|MK Ultra]] once or twice okay so MK Ultra is the merging of two things the first thing gets merged is this idea from Dallas that they're going to study it then there's another uh guy who's a 1937 surgeon SS guy named Kurt Plotkin Plotkin worked with the Nazis his idea was mind control through the use of Mexican pyote so he starts doing his stuff and the CIA is looking at the effective light and wireless technology and things like that that these guys are using and they begin to study it they hire a guy named Sydney gotle gotle runs the program from 5 through 53 through which we think 64 before of course all these things are destroyed but there's a lot of interesting things that the government finds out that is transferred to DARPA when does DARPA first form 1958 so all this information from the CIA and FBI are transferred into DARPA right DARPA then takes it the next level they go and they hire a guy in New Orleans I told you we'd eventually come back to New Orleans guy named Alton aser he becomes he's first an FBI asset as a surgeon but then he becomes a CI asset because of this issue here they go and hire a PhD researcher named Delgado and he's working in the two-lane neurosurgery department and neurology they get him out of that really quick and they send him to Mexico and they start putting wires into the Bull's Head to find out can they stop and control the Bull using electric signals why because they already have started to learn about Becker's work so now this is the idea now they're trying to execute they're trying to use this as a weapon yeah got it right so what happens in this whole time you the crazy stories that you've heard Bobby and I talk about on the tetr gramon podcast where Godly basically takes the Air Force plane over St Lewis and drops LSD on the whole city in the mid uh 1950s to see the effect they found out mesculin didn't work so the next step after that was to use LSD that's one of the famous things that we did find out from the church commission that they physically did so this is what I would tell you is Operation Northwoods probably negative 2.0 which is when the government thought it was a good idea that they could just do whatever the [ __ ] they wanted m to the United States populace they wouldn't know it so they didn't need any informed consent okay a lot of people think you know talk about Tuskegee and the Airmen and the syphilis dude there's a pattern with the industrial military complex when they want to do something they they don't even ask for forgiveness they don't ask for permission either they just do it so when they do this and godly fails what sight lines are really good for DARPA is this work that delgado's doing is amazing so they said okay you could do it with W uh wi technology and they were able to turn the bull off soon as he was going to spear The Matador they said let's try to do this Wireless why they had all the pats and everything they stole from Tesla they also all marone's work at this same time remember Motorola is now one of the guys that's the industrial military company they know that wireless telepon is actually coming so they decide to employ it here first so Delgato finds out that actually it does work you can do it without wires you don't have to do brain surgery on the the um the animal to do it and then they asked the next question they didn't have to they didn't have to install anything in the brain no they did not but this was the the key step this is the step where I think your audience you um people find it incredulous when I tell them the next step was could you do this using light and light alone and it turns out they found out you could if you use blue light specifically it actually destroys the dopamine reward tracks in your brain just so you know meta and Google today own those patents remember who's the Google patent attorney Nicole Shanahan so I said Nicole do you remember all the work you had to do and she goes yeah she goes I could never figure out what all this was about well you need to know a little bit about Google's history Google was formed in 1995 when [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|DARPA]] gave the search algorithm to uh these two cats from Stanford you know about Stanford now right you talked to me about uberman why they don't want to talk to me you starting to put two and two together yet yeah so the issue is these guys created the internet they connected all these uh colleges all over where the academicians were to share this information so this information is going all around in this area they basically then figure out and perfect the delivery of blue light technology through screens who is the big tech company in the 1950s and 60s that were doing this turns out that's IBM and IBM is working on liquid Crystal and displays and I remember this isn't the 50s and 60s you as a young man never saw those TVs until the 90s MH okay and then it got a boost from who Obama who made the analog to digital transition so that you'd have to use what LCD screens and then what else did he do we're going to ban incandescent bulbs why cuz incandescent bulbs not only have fake blue light but they also have purple and red which is what you need as the antidote to Blue they were banned yeah well they they the first ban was from Obama saying we're going to get rid of these under the guys that they're not energy efficient because they burn too much you you probably remember when you're kid you touch the incandescent bulb it's hot as [ __ ] yeah yeah yeah well the proxy that they're using to you is oh well they burn too much energy because they have UV light and red light in it and that makes heat so therefore we should get rid of that do blue but you have no idea that DARPA and the government already want blue light everywhere so they can control you with it that's the real answer behind this whole program so what happens then well how do they control us by by putting blue light in front by surround making our worlds are surrounded by these screens and these telephone like these phone screens how do they control us with this light I just told you they control by killing us no they control your dopamine reward tracks in other words they're dumbing you down they're making you much more likely to PR precondition which brings us to we are the other person we are dopamine slaves for the most part now most people you're the guy that's sitting with zins right next to you I'm asking you if zins are good yeah I can't go anywhere without my zins I'm telling you it's a problem but that's the reason why it it's all starting to make sense I'm trying to bring the picture together for you so you understand it so the chick you just asked me about Susan who started YouTube was a Google founder what you may not know about you ever hear the marshmallow experiment that was done at Stanford when she was a child remember she just died she's 56 okay so she's a little bit younger than me her mother puts her into this program which is part of the MK Ultra program to precondition her mind every single Tech CEO has been in this program just so you know that so she goes through it and she actually performs better than anyone else in other words she will follow the rules and be very compliant Sur goes sir it and so does Larry pagee so the the name of the program it's called the marshmallow experiment the marshmallow experiment okay it was the second generation of the milligram experiment which you can actually look at and what I'm trying to explain to you there's MK Ure 1.0 that we all found out about when I was a young man you weren't even born yet that's through the church commission right two things we found out there not only did MK Ultra exists but some of the things we're doing but we also found out then that the CIA had 400 people in the media that they paid Dan Rather and Walter KRON right Dan Rather and konai being you know the key players there so when you begin to start to see the timeline in all these stories come together uh well jiy gets the YouTube gig what is YouTube YouTube is a screen where you're developing videos you know you're addicted to it right now I make my living that's what addiction is all about well guess what the other question I want you to ask yourself as a young guy that's supposed to be smart have you ever asked yourself why it is that every screen comes out blue that they don't have red you actually have to put software in to change it you can I got M set to where like it turns red after like 700 p.m. yeah that doesn't work let me look at mine what it does that's how it should look whoa is that a special app yeah so you can you can we'll talk about it after we finish this but okay the point that I I want to make to you the question you need to ask yourself why is it that every tech company has Blu LD screens I'm going to tell you the reason why it's because that's how DARPA wants it they want you to be very addicted to the technology so it's sticky that way you can be programmed further so wow I know it's it's even more W than that you you haven't even got to the wow stage um so what happens with this lady she wounds up being compliant just like she was with YouTube you want to know why all these people get censored she did whatever DARPA whatever the industrial military complex wanted that's the reason why people were having their [ __ ] removed if you want to know the reason why [[Bitcoin]] con uh content gets removed is because DARPA is not interested in [[Bitcoin]] because their energy to fuel their whole process is cheap Fiat money [[Bitcoin]] is is actually a nuclear weapon for them right because you can't print money to do all the covert [ __ ] they're doing she goes and rolls her sleeves up takes the job she gets you know the turbo cancer she dies literally very quickly within I think six or seven months turbo cancer yeah that's from the sv40 promoter that's in the she gets screwed by the other part of the story we haven't got to yet so she de so when did she develop this cancer she just died earlier this year yeah but how long has she had the cancer like when did she six months before she died she got diagnosed 6 months before she died stage four lung cancer never smoked sounds eily familiar doesn't it to Jack Ruby remember how he died oh yeah that's exact that's oh so why did I lead this way CU guess what I just finished telling the story hly [ __ ] Steve Pull up the actual uh documented account of Jack Ruby how he died his name isn't Jack Ruby just so you know right I know it's Jack Rubenstein and he also is a Massad agent just so you know that let's see what the Google machine says about Mr Rubenstein Jack Ruby uh uh how type in Jack Ruby oh you can't find his death that's not that's not him he died he died he died right around when Garrison was doing uh right right when the trial the trial Jolly West so after Ruby shot Oswald Jolly West started visiting him in prison right but you know how he got the sv40 though wasn't that way let me let me tell you the the the the story so you get it okay cuz you really we probably need to jump into the polio story so you understand this part of it type in search for cancer he he gets pneumonia while he's in Dallas he's writing uh he's writing the Warren Commission to tell them to get him out of Dallas because he knows Carlos Marcelo has got a plan for him well he's going to use the bioweapon that they created on Magazine Street in New Orleans with Ashner I just got finished telling this whole story in detail at De Plaza to Bobby and to Nicole and to their administrative team and I have to tell you the guy that was filming and his eyeballs nearly melted about to melt it's it's it's a good story but it's the truth and the way in which you'll find out that I know the truth that's going to really blow your mind but the story of Ruby is interesting he uh is in Dallas he's talking to the Warren Commission says you got to get me out of Dallas and get me to DC because I know they're going to do something to me he already knows what's going to happen but he doesn't know how it's going to happen so he develops pneumonia in Dallas all this is discovered by by you and your guy back there MH so the doctors come in and they give him penicilin flu shots turns out in that flu shot was the SV 40 he gets stomach cancer and dies like that just like your girlfriend from YouTube and and guess what wh why was that bioweapon created that bioweapon was created by the industrial military complex and Alton Asner to get rid of Castro okay and guess who was the front for this whole thing the mob was involved in this most people don't know this but Carlos Marcelo grew up with Lee Harvey Oswald and New Orleans so he was one of the guys that was working for him and Oswald was also in the CIA so if you want to know the part of the story that no one has ever figured out is why did Oswald was able to go to Russia come back with cart blanch and never have any problem because he needed to be in a communist country so that Castro would allow him to bring this tainted cigar that he was going to smoke get the sv40 and die hm so that should ask the question in your head jack had the industrial military complex the CIA and the FBI all know that this thing was going to kill him that fast well I already told you what happened to Susan boom I already told you what happened to Rubenstein boom now let's get to the real story so 1951 comes along and you know the story about FDR he's got polio his lawyer starts the March of Dimes kids are sending dimes nickels and quarters to Joon Su Jonas Sal makes this vaccine he gives it to the pharmaceutical companies there's four companies that he gives it to but the one that you need to remember cuz your boy is going to be able to pull it up it's called cutter Pharmaceuticals turns out Cutter c u tt r no doctor ever learns about what I'm about to tell you now okay it's been whitewashed from history so here's the interesting part cutter Pharmaceuticals is in charge of growing this remember the date the date is really important for you get 1951 When was DNA discovered my friend 1953 by Watson and Crick so we're in the pre molecular biology age okay okay cutter tells all the four pharmaceutical companies tell Suk that his mix is very difficult to grow this vaccine so what do they do so says I think we need to use a primate that's close to humans then we'll have a good culture medium so what do they do they use the African green monkey okay turns out there's something they didn't know here's the good here's the good part of the story and getting ready to step step into Crazy Town um they're able to grow the vaccine on the African green monkey they use kidney cells that they grew it on okay they create SS vaccine and guess who's the first guy to tested Dr Asner in New Orleans at the Ashner Medical Foundation things that you need to know about Ashner he used to be he was a surgeon he was very famous for being an anti-cancer guy um he used to tell medical students way back when that if you this patient has lung cancer I want you to come and see it because you'll never see another case in your life that's how rare cancer was in the 1900s to 1920s that's this guy's reputation where you're catching him right now and part of his life he's probably in his 60s he's the dean of two-lane medical school he's also the head of surgery after Rudolph Matas who's a big famous surgeon in New Orleans that people today would know something interesting happens right around this time where he loses and gets thrown out do you know what it was 1951 he brings the vaccine into the amphitheater the surgical Amphitheater caus the ENT entire medical staff of Asner he brings his grandson and grandchild in there and he injects both of them with the cutter vaccine his grandson died in 7 Days of polio his granddaughter gets polio in her leg she doesn't die okay everybody who's ever trained in New Orleans knows about this story now younger doctors now they don't learn about it I was probably the last group of people late 80s and early 90s do you know why Ashner was already dead but you know who was alive his son and guess where I did two years in my neuros surgery residency my friend Ashner Medical Foundation wow oh it gets better hold on so I'm doing my first year of residency and you know who's filming JFK in the basement of Charity Hospital Oliver Stone so it's going down right then and there and here I am dude from New York in the Deep South seeing all this [ __ ] storm going around me do you know who my ER nurse was Virginia Garrison Jim Garrison's daughter this is the da that put Clay Shaw on trial for the assassination of JFK and no one ever made the links that I'm about to tell you so I'm sitting there while this whole thing is going on my first year and Virginia knows that in 2 months I'm getting ready to go to auster and she looks at me she goes bro you better be really careful about what what you do when you go there she goes cuz this guy is one of the most nefarious people you'll ever meet and I'm like what are you talking about and she starts telling me some stories about what her dad really knew cuz the guy that he wanted to put on trial was Alton Ashner but they put Clay Shaw on Tri you have to realize something in this day putting aser in New Orleans on trial would be like putting [[Anthony Fauci|fauci]] on trial in Washington DC right now you have no chance of telling the story that I'm about to tell you so remember Asner is the first ever National Cancer Institute doctor I told you he's the anti-cancer doctor so after he does this to his grandchildren he then turns around and tells the industrial military complex cuz that's who is developing this that look we need to slow our roll down we need to get this right uh we need to fix the problem so they casually turn all the science over to a doctor named Dr Bernice Eddie at the NIH Dr Eddie does all this work from 51 through 5354 DNA gets discovered and guess what Dr Eddie finds out all the original polio vaccines that Suk came up with were all tainted with SV b40 and no one knew it because DNA hadn't been discovered yet so she tells everybody in the NIH she tells everybody in the FDA that this has gone on and what does the Industrial military complex do my friend they [ __ ] passed the jab out to 300 million people in the world and they created the whole epidemic of cancer and guess what did the Industrial military complex allow Bernice Eddie to tell this story to anybody no so guess what Bernice Eddie did she got cancelled before [[Robert O Becker|Becker]] 25 years before that what did she do she gave it a talk in I think it was 1955 at the New York Academy of Sciences and at the end of the talk she drops the little nugget that I just dropped to you that oh by the way all the polio viruses were were were um contaminated with sv40 and what sv40 stands for for those in your audience don't know semi and virus 40 so that means there was 39 other viruses that are out there okay what do you need to know my friend about sv40 this is the only thing take a look at me I want you to look at me and not that this is the most important thing of this story I'm looking the sv40 promoter allows things to get across the nuclear membrane to get into where RNA and DNA is and do bad things okay so what does the government do after Eddie announces this to the freaking scientific World they defund her lab they take her out of the NIH she's lost to history here's the best part you go look today at the FDA and NIH website you'll notice from 51 through 57 you don't see anybody's name when I tell you this is better than 2024 YouTube cancellation you find no evidence of [[the cutter incident]] you know why most doctors don't know about it because of what I just told you so here I am training I don't know this is like maybe 273 years after this event and why do I find out about it not because I learned about it in medical school because Virginia Garrison told me what went down and then what did I do I went to the medical school library and started pulling stories up then I went even further I went to talk to Alton asner's son who's a cardiothoracic surgeon who happens to do surgery with us when we used to clip aneurysms we used to clip aneurysms we'd open the head but we'd have to stop the heart to clip them that's how long ago I I've been a neurosurgeon we don't do it like that anymore [ __ ] so in one of those cases it was a Basler tip aneurism Jo's opening the chest with one of his other doctors named Keith Van Meter and Jo's sitting there and I just casually tell my neurosurgery men are at the time I said I'm going to ask him about all this and he goes bro I don't know if you really want to go there but now here comes the part of the story that you're really going to [ __ ] the bed on so [ __ ] left I said J I said Is it true what happened with your niece and nephew about you know the polio vaccine he goes and this is the crazy thing this guy is a real chatty guy he I thought he would shut me down bro he started talking to me for almost an hour and a half two hours and once he opened up about that then I went for the nuclear weapon and I mean this literally in figuratively I said J tell me why is it that we have a nuclear device in the basement of a community hospital it's called the linac and who uses that Linx are used to treat brain tumors I said I know you guys have done really well here I said but that's a100 million piece of equipment and I said we can barely get new instruments to do spine surgery in this Hospital what so for people who are uninitiated I'm going to I'm going to go there just I'm I'm trying to give you the punch in the mouth so you understand where we're going so this is a device that is an electromagnetic device that delivers radiation from gamma rays all the way to RF radiation you can just turn it down no place outside of the nuclear Regulatory Commission has these devices at this time so when I was a first year resident and I walk over to Ashner and I see a linac laying down on its side and it looks like a nuclear weapon I'm going where in the [ __ ] did we get the money for this you know I and you know it's cool most doctors would say oh well we have Cutting Edge stuff you know we can treat brain tumors and this that but that's not where I was going with it I was like where'd this come from so in this talk that I had with J I had already been preconditioned by several of the people from the JFK movie and from Virginia Garrison herself and when she told me she goes there's more to this story that nobody knows that won't be in that movie that they're filming downstairs so she was really good about going to St Charles Tavern and talking especially when we came off a shift and I got her a little loaded and she started telling me about this polio virus and monkeys and this that and the other thing and I was like well I do know that we do a lot of monkey research at LSU cuz remember I'm I'm an LSU resident and we did have a monkey lab and I didn't I was like Wow and I knew tulan had a monkey lab so I'm starting to ask a lot of questions now and what I find out is that Ashner was that when this went down with his grandchildren and this Bernice Eddie thing this is a very short period of time three-year history he goes from being an FBI asset to a CIA asset then the CIA he they ask him specifically we want you to fix this sv40 problem so what does he do he goes out and he hires the world expert in viruses and oncology her name is Dr Sarah Stewart she trained University of Chicago you know where else is in the University of Chicago right that's where the nuclear program begins that's the fery research lab okay she gets her her compatriot who's a classmate Dr [[Mary Sherman]] who's an orthopedic surgeon who's an expert in bone cancer he hires both of them guess what magically happens Sarah Stewart is based at the US Public Health Hospital in New Orleans at this time by the military [[Mary Sherman]] is a staff doctor at osted foundation running the game here they set up a bioweapons lab the first of its kind on Magazine Street in an apartment and guess who the three people there are running it a young girl who won a science project in when she was in uh in Florida she actually is from Florida her name is Judith very Baker she was very interested in Sarah Stewart's work and when she won this thing Ashner pulled her and said you're going to be the lab technician she was promised a medical school education and a residency if she worked under Mary Sherman who else is in this mly crew David Ferry we'll talk about him in a in a bit who's the other person Lee Harvey Oswalt so guess what Lee RV Oswalt Judith Ferry Baker and David Ferry are doing they are running the bioweapons lab what year again this is 1962 63 right before they killed Kennedy so what's happening because remember Ashner how did he make all his money so how did he get tied up in this whole thing so you understand when I was a resident he had this nice Community Hospital wasn't huge but it's nice now it's a massive place but out in front of it he had all the flags for all the dictators that ran Central and South America he used to take care of all them they were all right-wing dictators he was a right-wing politician that's the reason the people at tlane University threw him out of being the dean and the head of surgery at Tulane so what did he do instead of getting pissed off he said [ __ ] it I'm just going to go open my own hospital to compete against you so that's what he does so how does he make it successful he starts working with right-wing politics all these people come and he becomes enriched by this the military is obviously very interesting this because they're the people that overthrow these governments down there that's why he was an FBI asset wow but when this [ __ ] hits with sv40 the CIA says to him you need to fix this what do you mean by fix it meaning you just the government knows that they just started the war on cancer like they gave the world cancer at record rates overnight did they did they know this was going to happen absolutely cuz guess who told them Sarah Stewart okay she was the world expert that worked for the government and when she heard what they did she said you need to hire Mary Sherman you need to put both of us on this project and we need to do this in clandestine fashion in fact the day that David Ferry gets killed Sarah Stewart's lab book was found by Jim Garrison this is a very interesting story my friend that now you can start to see why this is all really intertwined so what did they mean when they said you need to fix the sv40 problem meaning there has to be something that you can get that out of the genetic code okay so what did they do the CIA goes straight to the delegation in the United States Senate that controlled money at that time do you know who all of them were all the people in Louisiana how do you like that this is UE Long's son who's the state senator hail bogs remember he was on the waren commission y hail bogs is the the head of the the Appropriations Committee so magically Asner gets a linac delivered to the US public health hospital that's across the street from Children's Hospital on Henry Clay Boulevard and it's standing up in a building that is only three stories from the street but it goes three stories down in the ground and this thing is standing up like you would see a nuclear weapon like in the Planet of the Apes the first version y there's six targets that are pointing at the linac okay they start using small little mammals with the polio virus injected and they start zapping it with all different levels of radiation to see if they can eradicate it this should not sound crazy to you cuz that's exactly what oncologists do today right to tumors but guess where the problem lies what did the oncologist what did Sarah Stewart and Mary Stewart and the the mly crew find the more they irradiated the more lethal the sv40 became in other words it caused unbelievable cancer and it happened like that so these test kept going on going on going on going on and then what happens 1959 Castro comes in and you know that the FBI and the CIA all that stuff that you've already talked with [[Ian Carroll|Ian Carol]] about and well who's the other guy martyr made you know the yeah I haven't talked to him all but that dude he's the he's the academic historian and the other guy is like um I would call the conspiracy theorist right Ian but Ian's he's not not really a conspiracy theorist a lot of what he believes is right but M this whole thing nobody knows about what I'm telling you right now and how these things link because you know I even said to Bobby in the Tetra gramon podcast I said what's the difference between fact and fiction fiction has to make sense the story that I'm telling you right now because I can see in your face you're like dude this is the craziest story ever I've never heard any of this stuff before no you won't because I told you you do you think the YouTube stuff that you're going through now is bad do you think what you know the [[World Economic Forum]] and what [[Anthony Fauci|fauci]] done as bad bro you have no [ __ ] idea and that's the reason I'm telling you I was wise to this when covid came CU I know this story I lived it it was in the beginning of my residency and I I asked questions that's all I did I want to know why we had a Lin I want to know why what's going on in this polio story and then I said I want to know why the primate lab was moved from LSU and tlane and now it's sitting across the lake in cumington Louisiana well I got the answer through this story now I know the reason why so what happens is Mary Sherman is radiating the [ __ ] out of these uh mice they would bring the mice to Judith fery Baker who would homogenize it with Ferry and leh Harvey Oswald Lee Harvey Oswald was just the runner going back and forth and they had to have a front for him and Judith FY Baker what was the front they walked on worked on the coffee factory on Canal Boulevard so just so you know did I do my homework on this I had Judith FY Baker at my house on July 4th 2020 with the freaking receipts of them two working together it's published in her book but I didn't believe her I said yeah they were working together and he was an asset in this program why cuz he was is going to be the one to deliver this bioweapon in a cigar to Castro that's the reason he went to Russia so who's David ferry in all this thing David Ferry is a disgraced Eastern Airline Pilot who is involved with the mafia training the people for the Bay of Pigs he was here in Florida and he was in Lake Pon train there's pictures of David Ferry and Oswald in Lake poner train everywhere in New Orleans but you guys don't know about it cuz it was buried by Guess Who the Warren Commission the FBI right the people that didn't want this story out the only person that's still alive from this whole story is Judith the fery baker she's like in her 80s wow but she's written a book about it and I can tell you that there was parts of the book that I knew about it there was things that I knew that I knew she didn't know and there was something um this is really important there was something that I knew Bobby Kennedy if I told him he would know that I wasn't full of [ __ ] and that's kind of why I did the podcast with Rick Rubin and him and when I told him his eyeballs told me all I needed to know so when this project starts they find out that this thing can't be fixed in fact they just made the most right they just made the most lethal bioweapon on the planet so what does the Industrial military complex do what any any body does now with you know bad things let's take it as an opportunity so they develop it and that's where they come with the idea to take cter out because at that time the deal was we're either going to take Caster out or we're going to take JFK out why was the JFK thing a big deal JFK not giving air cover to the industrial military complex for the Bay of Pigs really was a huge big deal Y and there was a lot of people like David Ferry if you read the book about him dude he hated Kennedy because all those guys all those Cuban Exiles that he was training with Oswald they were all captured or killed so and he was got he was actually a pilot in the Bay of Pigs invasion in 62 I interviewed one of them not too long ago there you go um Felix Rodriguez so what happens is that Oswald never wanted to kill Kennedy he knew that the what the situation was if they didn't get uh Castro they were gonna have to do Kennedy which goes to the beginning of this podcast do you know the reason why Castro always stayed a step ahead of the CIA and FBI traficante was a double agent and guess how so this is where the story of the mob that very few people have put together um at that time you I just told you that the casinos go boom yes so they lost a lot of their money right Mo Dallas is kicking ass and taking names in in Vegas so the Chicago uh bosses um I'm still blanking on his name Sam it begins with the c his nickname used to be Momo that'll show you you may find yeah find him Steve Sam Momo um Chicago yeah well he he's uh friends with Carlos maralo marcalo controls both Florida and New Orleans Raa starts doing deals with Castro they started running all the drugs through gak there you go sh Sam ganana I just couldn't remember the name and um he starts running drugs through Florida and guess what the Italian mob finds out that this is more profitable in casinos so the reason why this goes down is he cuts a deal with Castro that I'll feed you any information I get about you but you keep letting us run the drugs through New Orleans and and Florida so that's where the mob gets involved with drugs mhm nobody in the CIA FBI knows really why this is going on so Castro is never able to be killed I think that the CIA is on record saying they tried to kill him seven eight nine times right they were always unsuccessful because of the link I just told you so what happens next they go and this is the best part of the story this is the part of story that really exonerates Lee Harvey Oswald but the industrial military complex will never allow you to know it they have to test the weapon Ashner knows that he has to test the weapon so he goes to Angola prison the same prison Johnny Cash is famous for going to singing they find a a uh a guy on death row they tell him they're going to inject him with something but they tell them you're going to die anyway whether it be by the gas chamber electrocution or here but we'll give you family money the guy actually agrees to do it they transfer him to Angola to a small little prison in Clinton Louisiana and you'll know why I know all this stuff and who drives up the bioweapon they don't let Judith very Baker do it they actually give it David Ferry Lee Harvey Oswald and Clay Shaw are in the car do you want to know why they put Klay Shaw on trial because he was seen in Clinton Louisiana which at the time in 1963 was a very black Town these are three white guys in a black Cadillac this is the same day that Martin Luther King gives his I Have a Dream speech and why is this a big deal in Clinton because they're registering black people to vote and guess who registers to vote that day in Clinton Louisiana Lee Harvey Oswald you'll be able to find it so guess what happen s this is how Garrison knew that Clay Shaw was going there he didn't know what he was going to do um but he had an idea so they go up to the prison they inject The Prisoner he's dead within 10 days of cancer so they get a positive on that guess what happens Judith very Baker finds out what they did through Oswald and she goes [ __ ] ballistic she goes back and tells Ashner Ashner threatens her says you're no longer going to medical school who's Asner again Asner is the guy that the doctor that that started this whole process okay the polio guy the guy that injected his kids oh yes the his grandkids so he gets Furious she runs back to Florida what magically happens next Oswald tries the attempt to go to Cuba to deliver the cigar he's unsuccessful literally is this when he went to Mexico City and tried to get to Cub Cuba correct oh my God that's exactly right bro you're putting the dots together I figured that you would once you hear all this but here's the the funny part of the story um when he fails he tells Judith FY Baker on the phone which you can read about in her book he says they're going to kill Kennedy and I'm going to be the psy so the first attempt on JFK's Life Believe It or Not is actually in Chicago guess who foils it Lee Harvey Oswalt with a phone call to the cops tips them off and they can't kill him they try to kill him here in Tampa too right but this is a month before they kill him in Dallas yes so um in Dallas what happens then you know the famous meeting be between HL hunt Clint meron uh Nixon the Bush family everybody's in this hotel in the Marriott Hotel that story gets told by uh lbj's you know piece of ass on the side M that get told I think that got told in like 2008 2009 I actually knew about that because that was some of the the juice that was dripped out to me in New Orleans MH and the reason it was important in New Orleans politics is because Ladybird Johnson um again this is how I fact checked it to know it wasn't [ __ ] Clint meron who was the first owner of the Dallas Cowboys is an oilman him and Lady Bird Johnson bought all the real estate from Dallas to New Orleans because I 10 was built in the 50s when Nixon was the vice president so Nixon told them where the road was going to go and that's how they got tons of money so when I fact checked that I was like okay this now is definitely plausible how all these people are tied together then the final thing that I did after my residency's over the US public health hospital gets decommissioned and I knew that when all this [ __ ] was going on with covid I said I need to go back down there and check the public health hospital out I was fortunate because the same janitor that was there when I was a a resident at Henry Clay Boulevard he knew who I was and I said I see they renovating the building I I said do you think I can get in there he goes dude nobody's used that in years he goes you know it's kind of empty and I said you remember the machine that was in there I said do you know where it went he goes no no one ever told us this and that oh the same machine is in the basement of Asar that's what happened and it was retooled by a technician so that it would lay down so we could use it for cancer patients wow so how did I know the weapon was there two two things um the first way I walked in I found out there was three stories below the the ground that you can never see mhm the thing that always was very unusual about this hospital it has a huge wall the Wall's about 15 uh feet tall like you would see around a base and it didn't make any sense to me it had these big huge metal doors because they didn't want anybody in there but the most remarkable thing about this when I got to the basement when I saw the six concrete stanions that were there massive grounding plates the grounding plate the wall behind you from where that exit sign is to that corner was that big and probably 5T taller and there's two of these in there with massive electric power lines going in there I knew what it was right away it was the grounding metal for the linac because you have something that make 30 million volts so you have to have something to you know get rid of it yeah so then it dawned on me wait a minute I know another way that I can prove that this [ __ ] was going on back in the 50s and 6 S I went to Entergy Entergy is the electric power company in New Orleans they have nuclear power plants this and that so I walked in there and I said can I see the bills for the US public health hospital you know for these times they're all uh covered by uh redaction and government stuff so I knew right away that I was right at Ground Zero where this happens now just just when you think the story is over 6 months after JFK gets killed David Ferry gets killed okay wow Jim Garrison how did he die no one knows so J uh this is the this is how I got Bobby entangled into this I'm talking about [[Robert F Kennedy Jr|RFK Jr]] so I would have no way of knowing this okay what I'm about to tell you it's very public that uh Jim Garrison was at the time scene cuz he was the da in New Orleans ferry is found dead he kept telling everybody in the French court that he was going to die when JFK got killed why because he knew he he told everybody they're going to K they had to kill Lee Harvey Oswald because Marcelo was linked to him he was a a key Ruby was the guy to do it then they took Ruby out as well so you could see everybody's dropping so Judith was back in Florida they couldn't find it the only person that who knew she who she was was traficante and everybody thought for sure trafficante would get her but he never did and um what happens with Ferry at his death scene Bobby Kennedy senior calls on the phone um or I should say Jim Garrison calls Bobby Kennedy senior because Kennedy and Kennedy uh senior and Garrison are talking why because Garrison knows that there's a conspiracy to kill JFK that began in New Orleans that and he knows that Lee Harvey Oswell has got nothing to do with he knows that Ashner Clay Shaw he he's putting pieces together okay the CIA the FBI they're bugging his office so they knew he was getting close that's why they try to make him look like a clown show but this is the key point when Garrison calls Bobby Kennedy senior to tell him about what he found guess who answers the phone Bobby [[Robert F Kennedy Jr|Kennedy Jr]] guess who knew that me and I told Bobby that in the tetr griton podcast I'd have no way in knowing that whoa so that's how he knew that I wasn't a tinfoil cat guy I was I put this whole thing together and I knew dude I knew about this from the beginning of my residency and that's part of the reason that I went to talk to [[Robert O Becker|Becker]] because I knew his part of the story was tied to this part of the story and this is before covid but it's also now explains to you why I didn't trust anybody during Co when I saw there was two legal definitions I knew that fiser was going to use the sv40 promoter but I had no way to prove it my friend none because you know I'm not a molecular biologist anymore I I can't do those things I'm not doing research I'm in clinical practice but I knew I knew what these [ __ ] were capable of and uh when I saw that I was like okay then the 2020 version of Bernice Eddie comes to the scene this is a guy you really should interview on your podcast his name is [[Kevin McKernan]] you know anything about him [[Kevin McKernan]] yes no I never heard of him you need to write his name down because this guy to me is an absolute Patriot and hero so Kevin you need to know a little about backstory because guess what it ties to the Google boys and it ties to DARPA remember Craig Venter Human Genome Project yes Clinton administration y told everybody humans are going to have 100,000 jeans chimps and monkeys will have 25,000 cuz we're so better than them that blows up in his face he's a transhumanist just like the guys at Google just like boisi just like everybody in Silicon Valley yeah so the transhumanist thing is bizarre no it's not it actually makes total sense dude these are all people who have been through the marshmallow experiment bro they're all been Zapped by the industrial military complex we ain't done yet take a drink of your your liquid death there I I need that I need one of these so so the transhumanist thing I always thought it was a scam no oh no it's actually evidence it's evidence of MK Ultra 2.0 3.0 4.0 but guess what Mk Ultra is called today do you know any of your conspiracy boys ever talk I have no clue brain health initiative set forth in 2013 By President Obama do you know where it's based in Central and South America a't that funny that it's in the same places where you can't find it and do you know what it's hidden in places called centers of excellence how do you know that I'm right do you remember the story I told you about Sydney gotley before in MK Ultra 1.0 when he took LSD and dripped it down on St Louis do you know who sponsored that uh that experiment Washington University in the US Navy that's also discoverable do you know where Washington University is Washington St Louis it's a major medical school in St Louis they were part of it do you know who sponsored the brain health initiative Washington University in the US Navy how do you like that are you did you put this together by yourself yep bro no one else is talking about this uhuh you just so you understand why what do uh doctors do especially good doctors they're diagnosticians they take a mystery and a patient to try to figure out what's going on this mystery I've been picking up Clues and breadcrumbs for 30 years of my medical training and I don't [ __ ] forget anything bro you see I'm doing this all from my memory right here do I have any notes in front of me no and I'm the only thing I I blanked on was the dude's name from Chicago right right right so this story isn't isn't finished yet so the brain health initiative comes in this stuff is being done in places right now many of the things that you're seeing uh in the transhumanist movement is actually being done so now you may start to understand why we have an open border all the people that have been through these training programs in Central and South America are being let into the United States and they're being deployed in very specific cities so you want to know why Springfield Ohio has who they have there do you want to know the reason why people are being brought into Alabama there's a reason my friend do you understand the game that's going on why why are they specifically bringing people into Springfield Ohio and Aurora Colorado and all that stuff like what what's the significance of those places what would a transhumanist do does the transhumanist really have any care about the people that are here or do they want their people that are easily controllable in like did sujan Wu jitsy wait wait my my my definition I thought the transhumanists were just like were people who were going to get their brains Frozen after they died no they're they're more than that my friend they're they're the same people like [[Bill Gates]] dad they're eugenists they want to trim everybody they're not interested like if you sat down and and talk to Nicole she will tell you stories but the reason I'm paying attention to this is you need to realize I pay attention to all the families of the big Silicon Valley people why because they are all tied to MK Ultra 5.0 every single one of them and there's a reason they follow the rules of the industrial military complex because they're designed to do that okay and guess what they get that training at the universities that they went Stanford Harvard just remember where all these people come from my friend n name any of them is this why you moved out of the country pretty much and look I've been saving this for 30 years and I believe we're in the ninth inning that if November 5th goes the wrong way that we're Venezuela we are where Venezuela was in 20052 2006 and shavez comes in and they take our guns you you Cal has already said she wants the guns my problem she changed it in the in the um debate she's stilling full of [ __ ] you know it yeah but here's my problem 55% of the United States population has been MK ultd through the screen technology so they're all obedient idiots so here's my position this goes very proximal to what Anne Ry wrote in Atlas Shrug if we ever get to a point where it's Mob Rules which is exactly why the Democrats always say democracy and not constitutional republic bro this is the problem and I believe we're here and you know you and I are in Florida right now I haven't told you this I have to come back one more time to vote and I vote in Florida oh do you vote here yes I do uh because I have a clinic uh in dtin and when I talk to Bobby about this he goes look I need you to vote for me even in that state he's changed his tune after he joined forces with [[Donald Trump]] now he wants me to vote for [[Donald Trump|Trump]] and I reiterated that literally two days ago in Nicole I asked Nicole Straight she goes nope we want you to vote for [[Donald Trump|Trump]] um my nurse who you spoke with Shantel Nicole told her the same thing we want you to vote for [[Donald Trump]] they and not for Bobby no because now well he dropped out so well but the thing is there was a talk that he needed to get the 5% to get the third party but now he realizes I think how serious the situation is so the podcast that I told you to listen to before I came on with you was the Lexus Jasmine podcast yes I made a prediction in there before it happened I said they're going to come and get [[Donald Trump|Trump]] again and guess what the day that we did the live X event with Nicole that guy at the golf course right that that that happened right then and there and I'm telling you right now they're not done no I expect at least two to three more times because guess what the only way to ensure the next step of the plan because what is the the real story of of co co is not what any of you think Co was an e it's um a compliance test for a coming economic reset so remember I told you earlier that the industrial military complex it's energy the source is cheap money cheap money is how they fuel all of these things so parts of the story that we glanced over that I'm going to tell you that I actually told Dr Alexis these parts are really going to infuriate you so I told you how we got the money laundering thing through drugs and how it started with Castro and trafficante what if I tell you that the War on Drugs Part Two started with the Iran Contra affair with Ronald Reagan and Oliver North the story that you believed as a young boy was that it was about running guns to nicaragu what if I told you it wasn't that at all it was to make sure that the industrial military complex captured the pathway between the Colombian drug cartel and the Mexican cartel so that they could deliver right opiods right into the United States fun Black Ops right and that's exactly what Iran Contra was all about it's a not a pile of money okay so are you familiar with Danny Sheen no Harvard lawyer who he was a he he uh worked on the Iran Contra case the Pentagon papers case uh the Watergate case all these cases he came in here and basically elucidated all this stuff beautifully but he's the one he's how I got my education in this all right well per perfect then I don't have to go through it again no no you it's it's no keep I don't me interrupt but I just want I just want you to understand what the goal was it was to create a pile of money so what has the government done first social security they stole okay then you have Iran Contra you know when that goes down that's another pile of money that they start the War on Drugs the government is fueling this because they need the money to run Black Ops right here's the big one who gets hired in 1982 my friend and at the same time [[Anthony Fauci]] okay by Reagan what else happens right then and there at that time you might remember somebody in the industrial military complex came up with the idea how about we have Americans donate um and to their own retirement called the Roth or SEP IRA so we can create this huge pile of money that the treasury and the FED will watch which has never been audited to this day so what did they do they came up with another plan through Congress so that now Americans put all their retirement money in so they're able to launder that money too so now let's do a hard stop because I'm not I haven't talked to you about this at all I don't know if you're a [[Bitcoin]] or not but maybe you can understand now why I don't pay like a close attention to it but i' own I understand I own some you will after what I'm about to tell you you're going to change that in a in a licky split minute so all this money is sitting in there no one's able to audit it so fast forward I don't know 20 years ago you heard about a guy named Bernie maid off right you know about what he did how did he get outed the owner of the New York Mets at the time Nelson double day put some of his money in there and he asked for it back when he was going through financial hardship and that's what took Bernie maid off down Bernie gets thrown into jail but guess what also happens the government realizes as soon as maid off goes down if anybody starts asking for money back they're going to have a problem so how old are you 30 I just turned 37 beautiful so I want you to thinking about your mom and dad they're Boomers like me who is going to be all these people that opened up Roth IRA starting to retire right about now what happens when you taper a Ponzi scheme and people start taking their money out cses have you ever looked at the rules for a Roth oh you don't have to take it all out all at once just take a little bit out of time we'll let you go all the way to 70 so go look at the years the Boomers were built the last year is 64 so so you're saying the boomers are hold on let me finish okay I'm developing this idea for you so in Bitcoin we have guys like Max Kaiser we have the big bitcoiners they always say Lawrence leapard you cannot taper a pzi scheme why because when people want their money back it causes the house of cards to collapse yes what if I told you that the industrial military complex figured out how to taper a Ponzi scheme with a you're slowly going to take people out who were complied so you don't have to pay them back bro and guess what why does it make sense what do you know about us tax law when people die that have a lot of money in a a Roth or an IRA don't they have to pay estate tax 55% so who's getting the gravy the government's getting that money back bro so guess what do you understand now why we started this podcast with Susan and the Turbo cancer and yet I took you back 50 years and showed it to you in Jack Rubenstein and what's happening now that [[Kevin McKernan]] has proven Kevin mckernan does the test takes unopen expired vials and [ __ ] tests and finds sv40 in a jab 50 years after the polio Massacre do you understand bro what really going on cuz let me tell you something I'm teaching you right now about the Dunning kruer effect when what you don't know turns out to be the most important part of the story everything you thought you knew goes so my friend that's the real reason why I went to Dallas two days ago and spoke at De Plaza and laid this whole story out on tape and told everything I know in every detail because if I happen to get taken out by acute Le toxicity I want a young guy like you who's doing this podcast to make sure you go [ __ ] fact check Uncle Jack but I promise you I'm not going to let you down every single one of you out there needs to know what I'm talking about these are the biggest criminals in the world they make [[Adolf Hitler]] look like a street Street gangster they've killed way more than 4 million people and they're not done they're they're looking to completely take out millions of people slowly over time all different kinds of ways so don't think it's over what did [[Anthony Fauci|fauci]] and and the B dolac and the law really do gave them the most impressive bioweapon ever and no one in the legal profession can sue them cuz they have immunity right got it right yeah understand where we're going now bro oh yeah feeling it I don't want to believe it it's it's [ __ ] terrifying well guess what that's that's you to be wrong but guess what this is a guy that does podcasts to talk about conspiracies and all of a sudden when you start to realize that all the conspiracies that you've done your homework with other guests but when the dude comes in here and puts it all together and you sit there and you go what did I say to you in this podcast like he needs to make a clip of this what's the difference between fact and fiction fiction has to make sense there ain't nothing about this that makes sense but guess what that's totally right you're totally right about that every single thing that I told you you can now fact check do you think that was true when this started out for me in 88 889 90 91 92 nope when did I know I was right right dude this program ain't going away and I've already told you where they're being tested now remember the black guy that was on death row in Clinton Louisiana now it's all people with brown skin that are in Central and South America that's what the brain health initia is all about see that's the execution part of the plan and then they're creating a military to bring them up to the United States now so that you're having all these crazy bastards that have been programmed now led into the United States and made citizens guess why not only they replacement for you which a lot of the black folks are starting to wake up to but they're going to be controllable Replacements this this plan has been in since Tavistock in 1921 that doesn't make sense oh yes it does why would you want if you're a country why would you want to do that to your population the the biggest thing because our constitution for tyranny treason death if you know about this and that Constitution is in law what is the goal of the industrial military complex you want me to distill this down for you so it lands they want to replace the US Constitution with the UN Charter that's what they want to do right because then they have free reign they then control the executive and Congress but what branch don't they control you know why uh they went back into the plan to kill Trump because he put two guys that are Fourth Amendment experts on the Supreme Court do you know why you can't get a [[Central Bank Digital Currency|cbdc]] through now because the [ __ ] Fourth Amendment blocks it that's the real reason bro that's why they hate [[Donald Trump]] that's the number one it's about the only thing [[Donald Trump|Trump]] did his first term that I'm happy about everything else he he basically is aing idiot that let all these people around him I mean just to explain this to you how pissed off I am about this he put Steve minuchin from Goldman Sachs as his treasury secretary right right then and there told me you're aing [ __ ] because that's letting a barbarian in the gate then what does he do hea the CIA lady who burned up all the all the documents for uh exactly but think about Jeff Cession it took him two days to turn think about Comey dude every single person around him so when you probably can tell I'm not really a trump fan but I told you I'm voting for him why because Bobby is now part of the team Bobby knows look Trump wants to drain the schwamp you know what Bobby knows he knows where the drain plug is that's what we need because let me just tell you something everybody in the Joint Chiefs everybody in the industrial military complex everybody in Congress there's people there's people that are sitting in Congress right now that need to be for treason okay they allowed this to happen and we the people let me just tell you something when [[Thomas Jefferson]] and James Madison wrote In The Federalist Papers why the [ __ ] second amendment is what the Second Amendment is you got to remember it wasn't for hunting wasn't for schools M it was to protect us from our government exactly yes and guess what bro we're here we are here they actually used if you want to know the story that you I don't know how much in other podcasts you developed let's talk about what really happened with JFK quick can we I want to basically summarize what we were trying to talk what what you were explaining to me earlier about the in the sv40 and with Roth IRAs so essentially the with what happened with the covid MRNA vaccine was it it it K and people mainly elderly people right people that were like 50 60 70 plus with multiple Co comorbidities didn't affect kids that's that's actually the front story they want you to believe that's not true you know who's dying now guys who are influencers that have big muscles and young like you cuz they all complied that's who's getting taken out the the boomers are getting taken out too but Co wasn't the real problem it's actually the treatment of Co which has taken you out right right and they know how do they know who took it do you know who went through the marshmallow program Sergey brin's first wife do you know what she does Epic that's the electronic medical record of the whole system so they know do you know who runs um 23 and me is it the CIA no Sergey brin's uh ex-wife this is just so you know the girl that not Nicole no the girl that your your guy just pulled up Susan yes her sister runs 23 in me how you like that I don't like that that's crazy well guess what I'm trying to tell you they have the data they're the data collection remember I told you that these kids that run these programs all of them are being controlled by the industrial military complex dude this this this has been planned all the way from when when [[General Leslie Groves]] left in 1947 you know what his parting gift was turning the OSS into the CIA they've been working with General gr when he's outside the government and do you know why he was forced outside the government because isenhower hated his guts and what did he do he formed a militia outside the military and they got powerful so powerful that they got all these companies in Texas Illinois and California to work as part of the industrial military complex and the government kept paying them and paying them and had no idea what grer is really doing and if you don't think groer is a smart guy just remember 1942 to 1945 he takes Operation Paperclip Allan Dulles sound familiar goes and harvest the best scientist in the world brings him to the desert and they make a [ __ ] bomb in three years that nobody could believe guess what so if you think think that they couldn't do something like this they made the atomic bomb in three years bro right that's how [ __ ] talented these people are and that's how smart they are and everybody who works there these are not stupid people they have an army that they've trained and that Army is based in big Tech and they are carrying out these attacks constantly on the American people and guys keep drinking Starbucks Coffee watching Netflix and getting Dumber by the minute cuz your dopamine levels are getting destroyed and you don't put it together but dude I'm laying it out for you I mean it's all there in front of you it's time for you to [ __ ] or get off the pot this is what I tell people but like this is my my my biggest thing I understand what you're saying I understand that the government wants people to be controllable that makes sense to me that's why kids go to school for eight hours a day and now we radiating with Wi-Fi right but what I don't understand is why do you want your population to be obese and basically physically useless because it makes it easier to kill them but if you want to main they're all owed money if you want to be they're all owed money that they stole already you still haven't got it that the story is always comes back to money you're talking about the IRAs dude I'm talking about everything we're 30 look I don't know if you know this uh yesterday um I'm trying to remember what his name is I'm probably gonna oh James lavish he's another bitcoiner it's got a tweet out there yesterday we crossed the Rubicon of $ 35.3 trillion just so you know something listen to this if we were to pay back a million dollars every second it would take 4,023 years to pay back that money so let me ask you a question when you see a lavish tweet like that and you think about where we are how the [ __ ] do you solve that problem dude got it no I got it it makes sense what you're saying I totally get it I know it makes sense dude I'm a brain surgeon I'm not a dumbass but what I'm telling you but I am and it makes sense to me no but you're not a dumbass because I'm going to tell you why you've been nibbling at this problem so many different ways you're like a great white shark on this whale and you keep biting at it you keep bringing all these people in here you know the bit bits and pieces what am I doing I'm giving you the final touches on the sculpture so guess what I need you to realize that you got to keep doing what you're doing like you now are the media let me explain to you why the media is gone the media is gone because of General Grow let me tell you exactly what their plan was they decided to abcon big science their plan eventually was to use big farm of money to start do advertising on the media so what did they do they made them all employees do you know how they came up with that idea first they did the same thing to doctors in the 1980s that's the reason why hmos came up because what do they do they put the government between us and our patients they did the same thing with the media and they did it 30 years before bro these people these people are brilliant Danny they I'm telling you they really are and the thing is all I'm doing with you guys today coming in here straight from off the plane so I'm putting some Windex on your glass eyes that's all I'm doing and I want you to understand truly what your world is all about because you said you got kids I don't know the cat behind the screen back there that's what I'm saying and I want you guys to understand that I don't want you to be bullshitted anymore like I always tell people half truth always leads to a full lie like all the people that you've had in here they didn't know bits and pieces of the story but you know why it was by Design the industrial military complex cannot let you know all this stuff cuz if you knew it you would [ __ ] take them out in a minute these people are more nefarious than King George was in 1774 right that's what I'm afraid of they're making [ __ ] [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] look like you know a gangster I got news for you bro these people are bad like really bad bad and until people wake up and see this like I'll give you an example don't you think it's unprecedented that a Kennedy and Nicole Shanahan who's probably the most liberal Democrat ever are [ __ ] joining with Trump that's pretty insane well dude for 18 months I've been in their ear in their ear why do you think I went on podcast you when I came in here you said just binged the uberman podcast and what did I say to you yeah it was a good podcast but Rick wanted me to do it to teach uberman but guess where uberman Works Stanford right that didn't go well did it I thought it was great no but uberman cannot examine the things that I'm saying shocked because of this podcast here I cannot believe well now I get it but before we came in here I couldn't believe that you haven't actually been on huberman's podcast no but there's no chance that Stanford would ever allow that bro plus that they know that I'm talking to Cole I mean when I wrote the book I always thought hubman was a plant anyways well I don't know if he's a plant I think he's a useful idiot for science because he's all about captured science right and the way he sells science and his friends that sell science it's all for the benefit of the Paradigm and power and they're happy to keep collecting the money you know that's why you see me pound on Peter a and why I pound on I don't pound on Yuber anymore because I realize what he is and you know he's a good friend still to Rick but I have to tell you Rick is um Rick Rick's the same agees me and and we kind of grew up in New York together you guys been friends since childhood no no no what we got we got to be friends when I helped fix his own issues you know being 400 lb and and wearing sunglasses a night but the thing that Rick is he's a boomer too that is sick and tired of being lied to as well right you know and he's a lot like probably you guys he likes the conspiracy theory but you know he tells you you know when I started giving crazy a chance it actually really changed my life and he goes now I don't think anything's crazy he goes I just don't have enough information to know if it's [ __ ] or not right and he goes the more I keep digging the more I begin to realize that this is a big deal like when I told him this story um before I sat down with Bobby Kennedy you should have seen his face mhm oh my God I mean this would melt this is you know the information that you're letting out right now is enough to melt anybody's brain it's insane it's it's it's literally sounds insane and that's quite literally what the military-industrial complex and organizations like DARPA have been doing since the 50s is things that are completely wacky and insane like MK Ultra and the things they were doing at the uh the hate ashbery Clinic with these experiments with LSD and amphetamines and with Charles Manson I know you're familiar with Tom O'neal He wrote a book on this well actually somebody actually from Twitter after you announced that I was coming on your podcast somebody said I need to to do a podcast with Tom O'neal He said you guys would be oh my God he's amazing yeah he said you guys would be right up each other's alley but no this is the crazy part of my story I don't know these people that you have had on but the part that ties all this together is how General Grove stole big science and how it links to everything else because it ties everything together and what am I trying to point your audience to it's money that the problem is they need that cheap money to continue to go on and on and on and they need the government to continue to provide it that's the reason the [[Central Bank Digital Currency|cbdc]] look American money's failing and they knew it was going to fail from when Nixon did the Nixon shock in 71 when they removed you know gold from the gold standard what what did you hear Danny just literally four or five weeks ago at Bitcoin Nashville in the summer both Bobby and Trump came in and said we want to make Bitcoin a reserve asset this is not music to the industrial military complex ideas and that's why I'm trying to tell you that literally I made the prediction two years ago on clubhouse that's an app where bitcoiners hang out I remember it yeah I told a guy named American hle that they would kill Trump or attempt to and they're like no bro there's no way if you remember uh Gerald Ford said after the Warren Commission that we're done doing that kind of deal bro he got his ear pierced yeah and then they just try to do it again here in Florida right so how many times like I don't want to tell you my predictions are you know a prophet but dude that tells you that I'm over the target I'm telling you something that you need to hear I don't care if you don't believe me but what I'm saying to you is understand what I'm saying research what I'm saying look at all the pieces and parts understand how they explain World current events right now how how we we can have what we just saw in the debate now that we know the two people on the debate one of our sorority sisters are feeding her the information dude this is exactly how it works who's paying for those two people's salary big Pharma put on any [ __ ] true I heard that the two people that are the biggest donors to Trump and to cala are Peter teal for Trump and his vice president right and Eric Schmidt yep Google he used to who are they're both close right and they're both the representatives for the US and the Builder Summit yeah and I'm also going to tell you not only Bilderberg starts with Tavistock in 21 then the trilateral commission through the [[Rockefeller]] years and the committee of 300 dude you're banging on the right drum do you know the do you know what I want to teach you before I leave here do you know the synonym that you need to start using for Bilderberg or the Roch house it's called all loyal money pull pull that one up on screen so he can see it loyal money is money that has no superior meaning there's no title you know who that starts with that starts with the papacy and it starts with the royal family in other words nothing can be taken from them do you know what people have see a loyal title on that so do you know what you know what that means there's only one other thing that's ever showed up in your 37 years on this planet that's a Loy deal that's Bitcoin and that's why they're coming after you you bro that's why they're coming after this money I'm going to tell you right now it what do we say in Bitcoin when you have your own stack they can't [ __ ] take it from you and this is the only thing in the world that's like that right now if you're not the pope and if you're not part of the royal family right the bilderberg's every single royalty is cousins with [ __ ] King uh Charles right now every single royalty that's existing dude this this story the people that back the industrial military complex are those people they're the real problem but guess what they're the ones that have propped up Gates they're the ones that have propped up the who they're the ones that propped up the world economic form dude these are the more layers they put between them and us the better it is because guess what what I say to you before fact or fiction do you understand why guys like me and you we get branded with the hat and we're the conspiracy theorist but here's the thing that they didn't plan for I'm a [ __ ] nurse surgeon I've been doing this for 30 years I'm a really good diagnostician so good that I haven't been sued once in my career I'm good at what I do and I've held this story until right now why because it's important right now it's important for my kids it's important for your kids it's important for every single person that's out there listening to I don't want to leave this planet with thisinformation so that we have to go back through the Dark Ages again for 500 years until we take these [ __ ] out again the person who made the mistake do you know how this all started Queen Victoria Queen Victoria decided to marry into all the royal families to stop a war because she knew her family is filled with a bunch of idiots and what did she wind up doing she created World War I it was a family squabble and do you know what you know what set them off and how they lost their all loial titles the Bolshevik Revolution and guess what when they killed the Zar who is the cousin of King George at the time in England and Kaiser willham in Germany neither royal family could believe that do you know one of the most unprecedent unprecedented things happening in the history of the 20th century that day when the Zar was killed the royal family in case you don't know their real name is sax Coburn um Goa they're German they realized it wasn't popular to be on the wrong side of the war given what happened with Romanov so what did they do they took a new name off a castle in the north of England called Windsor and that's how he saved his ass and what did he have to do he had agreed to to a new part of parliament called The House of Lords or Commons so he had to give power up to the people he lost a loyal title wow that's how it started but he did it to save his ass so let me tell you something Britain has won two world wars and both times they lost the first one was the big one were they lost a lot of their power mhm what did they lose in World War I they lost two things they lost the sea to the US Navy but what's the big one the Treaty of Versailles was a huge hit to the royal family because the way it was settled by the Keynesian economics it guaranteed a second war why did they want a second war to get back what they really lost they lost a loyal title and they wanted it back and if you don't think that I'm right about this CU you're talking to somebody who knows their history inside and out after King George is dead his brother takes over you know who he is Edward iith do you know Edward II had to abdicate his throne do you know why cuz he supported Hitler Hitler was part of their plan dude oh yes they knew exactly what they were doing trust me is this some of the stuff that that marmaid guy was talking about yes indeed that dude is spot on on the money and and you know what when he said in a recent podcast and cuz I have been dead silent on this topic that Churchill was one of the biggest [ __ ] shows in the history of the 20th century it's true because what he basically hides is the real story everybody believes the 4 million Jews the Holocaust the snap what people don't know is that the people that backed the royal family killed 60 million Christians in the Bolshevik Revolution that is absolutely true but guess what it's very similar to the 1951 to 57 story where it was whitewashed from history and every time that we have a period in history where something gets whitewashed that's where I hope a guy like you Danny Jones in the future as you age when I'm dead you remember the lesson I'm trying to teach you here when you do podcast go find people that really know history Danny you know it's hard well I know but you know that as a young man when you were growing up you didn't learn any history from General girls all the way to right now do you understand why do you understand why they put your kids now for 8 to 10 hours a day because they are training your children you're not I am not kidding you dude and what are else are they doing no more books they're radiating that's MK Ultra it's [ __ ] everywhere you look bro but the you know what the problem is you know what pissed me off the other day was they started Fe my the teachers feeding my uh my 5-year-old came home he's like you know what the teacher gave us for snack time today I'm like what what do they give you she's like all week I've had Rice Krispies treats you never let me have those at home my wife was Furious she L went up there and talked to the teachers the same day it was like there can't well you're going to be more Furious when you find out that that's how Gates now plans to put some of the biotechnology in Foods that's the reason he's buying up Farmland it's also the reason he wants to block the sun cuz guess what what's the antidote to blue screen technology UV and red light why did Biden put the final damper on incandescent bulbs it's going to be banned completely in 2028 you say they they said it was energy but it wasn't energy no it's because they know it's it's the blue light the blue light keeps the system going in perpetuity and none of you realize it none of you because you know what a you're not smart enough to to know the history B you're not a neurosurgeon you don't know anything about the non-visual photo receptor system in man and and here's the sad part most centralized doctors know either like there's so many bombs that I gave you in this podcast already that people's heads are going to explode and I don't expect them to know this an hour or two or three like you'll probably go back and listen to this 10 years from now yeah when I'm dead and you're going to go bro this guy was telling us the truth and I'm going to say something this may be hyperbolic but this moment in your podcast this is Paul River riding through Boston and I'm telling you they're coming you know what I expect what should people do about it I need you to put your Pitchfork down and start rowing all in the same direction we have to protect We the People whatever you can do Danny whatever the cat behind the the the screen can do Steve sorry about that Steve we need to come together and we need to take our country back these people The Barbarians are inside the [ __ ] gate the Trojan Horse is inside but it's just I'm going to remind you about something you may think I'm pessimistic I'm not you know why a bunch of people who are misfits from the UK who were farmers who had pitchforks got muskets and beat the best army in the world let me tell you something Danny there's 360 million of us and we still have that second amendment this is the problem that people don't understand I think for the most part is that's why I think they want to keep us divided correct that's what all the game with the media is and how do we find a way to unite everybody because I think this podcast is one of those things I think what I just did in Dallas with Nicole I mean look what's going on with Nicole and Bobby you don't think that's a a an amazing thing that you've seen that people ideologically who really don't like each other are now like in other words people in New York and Virginia in 1776 said [ __ ] this m they they had different political aims right they came together so why can't we like I've gotten criticism uh not that you've leveled it but people on Twitter have leveled this like Jack on your Twitter profile you say you're you know a guy in Exile yeah you're right but I I casually point out Where's Thomas Jefferson Benjamin Franklin and James Madison home country was it the UK yeah so they fixed it from being somewhere else why can't I right I went I went to El Salvador and sat down with president buelli and told him a lot of this story and what did he say to me how would you fix it Jack I said I'd put a constitutional amendment that's just like Benjamin Rush asked [[Thomas Jefferson]] to do so that the attack factor for the US Constitution couldn't be medical tyranny so you know what he told me to do write the law I did so buelli has it guess who else has it Bobby kenned you know who else has got it now Trump this little neurosurgeon sending across from you on a phone who came off a plane I'm that dude bro don't tell me that one of us can't do it if not you who it's terrifying [ __ ] not for me bro I you know what I haven't processed it yet so I I I I've been thinking and living this for 30 years and I know it's a lot for people to hear but it's kind of like the way the best thing I can try to educate you about this you're like sitting across from me and you're a new person who I just diagnosed with a gleo blastoma and I'm telling you you got a year to live that's kind of the same thing I'm telling you here the difference is I know you're going to die when you have a GBM but I know you got a big chance here you won't die and you won't be an economic slave for the next S 8 nine 10 generation ation of your family if you stop being apathetic and nihilistic and get off your ass turn theing Netflix off stop drinking the coffee stop buying their products and go take your country back it's all you got to do there's a reason I came here bro how do you know all this [ __ ] and still have time to be a brain surgeon um let me ask you a question if uh I'm mattered than hell that my profession was stolen we no longer when I wrote my medical school application out I had no idea that I was stepping in to basically an army that was programmed by the industrial military complex and when I found that out in 2005 you'll and you'll hear this Danny many many podcast I do I get matter than hell when you ask me a question like that I'm thinking about that 18 months when when I realized everything now you know it just wasn't a story about lepton wasn't a story just about all the biology stuff that I teach it was this story in the background that I knew about this yeah in the beginning it was very easy for me to question them like many doctors asked me how did you fight back you know I just did the live Twitter x's and I have to tell you I haven't I mean you're the first person I've talked to this I haven't even discussed this with Chantel Mary Bowen the doctor that was sitting next to me the ENT doctor she said you know they had this plan because doctors are very compliant you know you have to do that for medical school and this and that and I looked at her and I said should I just drop this bomb right here right now and I didn't I didn't I didn't say the things right then and there because here we are on Twitter there's millions of people going to look at it and I said this isn't the appropriate venue to drop this but let me just tell you something Danny I'm thanks for destroying my podcast I'm just [ __ ] M than hell about this and I think that I I think every American should be infuriated that sv40 is in this job and here's the crazy part for Steve behind the curtain in here I'd like to hear your guys take home now that I've given you the whole story tell me what your first visceral thought is to know that the FDA still hasn't stopped the jab today knowing everything that we know about the aftermarket data well I mean it just what the whole covid pandemic really taught me and I think a lot of people is the revolving door with between the FDA and the pharmaceutical Industries and the FDA seems to be more of just like a propaganda wing for the pharmaceutical industry actually I'm going to tell you it's part of the program this is all MK Ultra dude you're seeing it laid out yeah this is this is now MK Ultra I have a a pretty famous quote that was in my TED Talk that got banned ideation without execution leads to deletion of every good idea let me just tell you something MK Ultra was a great idea that they originally stole from the Nazis right but they executed the Nazis didn't that's the truth bro and I when I remember when I wrote that that quote I had General Grow in mind when I wrote that quote dude he's the biggest criminal in American history and he has bred so many criminals started with Jimmy burn look even The Manchurian Candidate they set up which was Harry Truman because they got rid of the three- term vice president which was Henry Wallace dude even when he realized he was Hoodwinked he couldn't do anything to stop it that's how powerful these guys are so the only president that has been how shall I say above board they took out with acute lead toxicity that's JFK in my opinion the country doesn't heal until we know the truth about what happened with him yeah that's my opinion and I'm telling you exactly what happened and why it happened and what all the collateral effects are of that decision there's a reason there's a reason I I'm not a political guy but I put my chips behind Bobby and Nicole he knows a lot of this story but he can't talk about it either bro because you know what'll happen but guess what have you ever found it unusual that everybody knows Trump used to be a Democrat he was best friends with John F Kenny Jr he said when I get in I'm going to tell people about what happened with JFK but he didn't right you know why cuz he found out just who was involved turns out some of his friends were involved Trump's friends yeah in the Mad yeah Israel you think that Israel was involved in question about it dude let me just tell you something Israel is kneed deep in this what what part of why would Israel have anything to do with JFK who who was Meer Lansky and mo dallot with dude they want wanted dirt on him let me ask you another question did you find it unusual that our boy [[Jeffrey Epstein|Epstein]] soon as they broke into his apartment what they find over the mantle a picture of [[Bill Clinton]] and Monica Lewinsky's blue dress right dude the mad is about having information yes on the states right what was what was the big what was I'll give you another one for your conspiracy theory cuz we didn't talk about it yet yeah I'm just not buy how they get paid off how'd they get paid off for JFK do you know how they got paid off paid off the the Israel people I don't think Israel was invol I don't know I don't I haven't seen anything compelling uh involved in JFK's assassination well I do I know they were involved okay those guys Jack Ruby was a Massad agent the Jewish mob was involved everybody in the mob was involved for different reasons but they were involved MH how they get paid off let's talk about the payoff I think it's possible that you don't want to go there do you no I do but I I want to I want to explain I think it's possible that Israel was involved in the process maybe Downstream but I think top level I've had this guy on here multiple times his name is John Newman he's the guy that everybody who writes JFK books they all write their books based on on his work he's the guy who's read the over a million Declassified documents on JFK he's been studying it his whole life and his theory of the whole thing is that what happened in D Plaza is all a distraction he thinks that de Plaza the reason everybody talks about D Plaza is because it's it's the exciting thing to talk about it's where the bullet hit his head and um everything that led up to that is the important part of it that's because your boy Newman doesn't know the the key pieces what's the key pieces what was the payoff you you remember back in early 1960s we had the Cuban Missile Crisis and then we had all the [ __ ] that was getting ready to come with the Jews and the about the war in ' 67 and all that and Israel was really worried about themselves and they told Kennedy they first told Eisenhower that we need a bomb our Jewish scientists gave you the bomb we want the bomb Eisenhower told them to go [ __ ] themselves guess what JFK did same thing in fact do you know what JFK did right before he died the year before he died he actually told the Jewish State I think it was benan that was the Israeli Prime Minister at the time that not only are we not going to give it to you but we want our guys to go in and examine what you're doing yeah and they were Furious guess what happened when LBJ came in magically he gave it to him some uranium went missing at a place in Pennsylvania and that is how they started their nuclear program H pull that pull that one up Steve yeah it's called if I'm not mistaken Dominion or Demian it's the Demian incident that nobody seems to know about but guess what that was the payoff and what's the collateral effect of this my friend that Newman probably doesn't want to go to turns out we happen to know there you go no no no no this would be it's uh put down put in the search uh Israel Pensylvania uranium visionable uranium Pennsylvania Pennsylvania no get rid of the dominium yeah uranium fision go to the incident you can leave incident there just get rid of the other thing uranium incident there you go thank God for AI there you go there it is the Apollo Affair 1965 incident in which the US company in Pennsylvania lost a large amount of Highly enriched uranium that was suspected to be sent to Israel's nuclear weapons program oh here we go yeah well so hold on I'm not done yet okay you're gonna have to hold on for me now now I'm going to run your podcast this is your show no here's the the second thing that happens the collateral effect uh I think the guy you had on told you a little bit about this this is the Ian Carol cat mhm that all the Jews showed up in New York before 9/11 happens and they're all in theing Israelis no oh the art thing yeah yeah yeah do you know why because the Mad trained the four Arabs to take the planes over and run them in the building mhm got it and what was the point of that think hold on what was the point of that point out was one point you can pull this up is the Patriot Act was walking around Washington DC from 1999 all the way to 2000 and everybody said there's no way you can get this in and George Bush said hold my beer yep and with Thomas Drake bro I'm just telling you yeah no I agree with you I I agree with you here if you agree with that then you better learn about that because that is that was the payoff for JFK and they've been involved ever since and guess what that brings us to current events with [[Jeffrey Epstein]] now let's really make it current who's the new Jeffrey I've seen P Diddy Diddy same exact prosecutor they used for Gane Maxwell well guess what bro this is the same ball game bro I'm I'm just telling you history doesn't repeat but it rhymes awfully loud and I'm telling you right now everybody needs to know this story every last piece of it is connected John's big point about JFK he thinks that the the big picture of it is that General litzer and Taylor they wanted a nuclear war they wanted to Nuke China and they wanted to Nuke Russia right and they had a meeting in June of 63 or 62 where uh Bobby Bobby did he ever tell you why that was the case I'm just curious he probably did I'm not remembering off the top of my head because both of they were proteges of grow and that's what grow wanted to do okay and grow stepped out who stopped grow Eisenhower right remember what Eisenhower said in 1961 farewell speech mhm yep oh you are you starting to see now what Gro did he went outside the military and still had control over the Joint Chiefs of Staff all during Eisen how and Kennedy's presidency and you know what the interesting thing is who opened up China in 1971 Nixon who was Nixon the vice president of Eisenhower right bro I mean how many how many things do I have to keep [ __ ] knocking down for you you're knocking him down man I'm not denying it you're uh you're you're on it I think the JFK assassination though I think like many things can be true at once I think there was a lot of things going on there one of the the biggest Smoking Gun that Jon uncovered was there were was a an FBI flash stop on Oswald's file the FBI was watching Oswald they had a flash on his file and a a week before the assassination it was removed from his file so he basically says Oswald being on that route in Dallas was the equivalent of a flea being at a Lysol convention there's no way he should have been there the flash stop was removed yeah you got to remember something there was a reason he was there right he was working with the FBI agent on Magazine Street that is documented in Judith F's book see I'm going to tell you about Newman he doesn't know [ __ ] about Judith F Baker he doesn't know anything about that that's the reason you got to go back to him and say bro you you're missing huge Parts I can tell you he doesn't know [ __ ] about this Lin but dude I'm the guy that worked with that Lin and I Prov to you already that Bobby is the one that got the phone call when Ferry got killed so if you don't think that story Trump's anything that he thinks what he's doing he's trying to put breadcrumbs together everything I told you links perfectly you don't have to believe it and I'm not trying to convince you to believe it but I'm telling you this was done on [ __ ] purpose and the reason the FBI stepped back is because they knew that Oswald was a CI uh operative right without a doubt right but he was be he was there to be the psy and Oswald knew it if you read shoed FY Baker's book she said it she told him he told her two months before uh the assassination that he knew that he was going to be a py the thing he didn't know is that his friends Carlos marcala and Jack Ruby yes we're gonna take him out Ruby is a Massad agent right no yeah I agree with you I I and and John agrees with all of that stuff he just believes that and and look he like everything that you're saying about OS while being there being a paty and Ruby working he he he would probably agree with you on all of that stuff his only point is that everyone wants to say the CIA killed Kennedy his point is the CIA was the cover up the military killed kenned it was a military coup is his point no but I think this is semantics and we Parson words exactly you have to realize that [[General Leslie Groves]] was the military and he is the Deep State it's where it began right that's what I'm saying see the problem is and I I guess maybe the difference him being a journalist and me being a doctor I look at it making a diagnosis to make a diagnosis you got to go back to the root cause I'm taking you back to the root cause right that's the difference between me and them and I have to tell you it turns out that this part is the biggest missing story in the JFK story and the truth be told if you talk to the people in The Garrison family if they'll ever talk I doubt they will I can tell you that they physically told me that her dad wanted to put Asner up on trial he didn't want to go after Clay Shaw dude do you realize he puts Alton Asner on trial everything blows up like the Warren Commission never happens and just remember the people that are on the warrant commission like I'll give you another example why I don't trust any of the journalists and this will probably get me in a little bit of trouble with the JFK thing but you know the guy who's um you're not getting any more trouble you already got but you know the guy that's been he's now doing stuff with Paramount and talking about the mob and this thing I think his name is Tom Maine oh yeah I've heard of this guy uh Tom um he's doing the stuff with all like uh mayor Thomas mayor you got it so do you know what award that he won in the past the John McLoy award do you know that John McCloy sat on the Warren Commission do you know that if you go listen to things that he says he tries to listen to him really carefully he tries to skate around a lot of stuff that you and I are talking about really dude he's he's who the church commission warned us about do you want to know how many people in this industry that you're talking about that they're [ __ ] scammers that they're working for the other team how about 99% of them right no that's what I'm trying to tell you bro just remember what's my day job am I making any money off the JFK thing no I'm a doctor y you're not selling you understand what I'm saying yeah I that's what I need you to understand no I get it incentives dictate outcomes these guys have made an industry out of this guy's death right what am I telling you this is about the Republic bro yeah it's a totally different ball game and what am I asking you to do use your head Jack this is fascinating but I have like all this stuff I want to learn from you about health and about science and medicine too so can we transition a little bit and talk some more about like your background in brain surgery and sure and um and what you do I want to learn more about like the protocols that you use to live your life and to subvert this like blue light attack that is that is happening to everybody um the I want to open it like my first question is how did you meet Rick Rubin uh through helping him out I think it was a dinner that we had with a a guy who's a veget Arian named David avocado wolf you ever hear that guy he's like a wackadoodle is he is he a vegan was he a vegan and Rick was a vegan right and Rick was transitioning from that lifestyle to the new one with him being a mighty condra and Rick began to realize that it was more about light not about food and he this is the thing you're going to learn about Rick he's a good guy he tries to like help his friends that are going into the car crash and Jack is totally different I I try to tell Rick as a doctor you can't help no you you they have to be willing to help themselves and if they're not you just got to let them go through the car crash and then hopefully wounds create their wisdom that's what I teach my tribe right uh but that's kind of where it went down and then the other person that that we kind of Link together he was already following my stuff for a while but you remember the dude that um that wrote the game uh he was the the lead editor of Rolling Stone magazine uh Neil Strauss oh yeah Neil has a thing on the side that he does forillon millionaires so these are all high net worth guys and he tries to teach them you know things to improve their life which is it's pretty cool um Rick told Neil to invite me out to one of those and I did that I don't know maybe 10 years ago and um they wanted me to talk about you know certain parts of what I did and I think if I'm not if mistaken I talked about the I clock at that time which is the super cosmatic nucleus because basically my science decentralized science the [[Quantum Biology]] comes down to three things we talked about it in the beginning light water magnetism so if you distill what I do you have to optimize those three arms if you optimize those three arms you can stay away from centralized medicine you can stay away from Big Pharma you can live a good life uh and not have to worry about being Tethered to that sausage maker yeah that's really why the Ted Talk was banned they didn't want that message out they wanted you on OIC right you had a story of a lady who came to you in your one of your clinics and she you had no idea why she came to you but she I know where you're this is the thing we talked about in Rick's podcast yes yes the lady the lady who wanted french fries well yeah it well there was another lady too there I want I want to hear both these stories there's a couple of them but the one you're talking about specifically um um this is before I had my come to Jesus moment meaning um the whole [[Quantum Biology]] thing it was very unusual um a lady tried to get in my office the girls in my office kind of [ __ ] blocked her because they thought she was B [ __ ] crazy and she said look I don't have a Neurosurgical problem but Dr Kruse was involved in my care in a very weird way and she told the girl at the front desk that she had a heart uh transplant uh because she had I think it was myocarditis but from a virus right and she got a heart and I was the neurosurgeon that got the family to donate this kid's heart and she figured that out somehow through the paperwork that the hospital gave her and it turned out she was right and when I heard the story immediately I knew what she was talking about and I had to go back and look at my files to see the details around the kid but the thing that I remembered is the kid was at a McDonald's drive-thru and a car came and T-boned him and he just got his like happy meal and the thing that they mentioned in the EMT report is that the kid had french fries all over his front seat and I remember his mom telling me she goes oh if he never went to McDonald's but he always loved their french fries that was what stuck in my head so I actually had to go back and pull the kids chart to find out and it turned out I was the neurosurgeon that pronounced him brain dead so that's when I called up you know the organ procurement agency and and got the family to donate I'm a little bit different than most neurosurgeons a lot of neurosurgeons turn it over to the hospital and let them do it I think it's much better if the neurosurgeon talks to the family that way cuz we can ask answer questions way better than they can right and neurosurgeons are pretty good about subtracting the emotion out when something like this happens like Danny it's it's hard to to say this to someone across the table but uh neurosurgeons deal with death and destruction more than any other doctor in any other specialty right so we're really good at it now I'm going to tell you more than heart surgeons oh yeah not even close heart surgeons don't deal with death hardly at all okay just the ones they kill but the the thing that happens with us we catch people at all parts of life people that have gbms you know at the end of the life like 70 80 years old but kids that have subdural app girls you know that are 18 19 years old I mean the the last case that I did I just took a bullet out of someone's temporal Lo who I think was 22 years old and the thing is when you deal with that stuff all the time you're the best person to talk to the family I just and I had an uncanny record of getting people to donate because I think uh this happens to be a skill set that I have a real really good skill set and um part of me it bothers me because I know that these people are going to be Tethered to Big farmer but at the same time the most valuable asset that we can give in decentralized medicine is the gift of time and I have to tell you I think the reason I feel passionate about this if you know the other parts of my story when I talk about Bitcoin I tell people Bitcoin is a time machine but I'm going to tell you that your mitochondria and you is also a time machine and when you do an organ trans plan you're effectively giving someone a time machine and to me that's the reason why early in my career the people that taught me that's why I go all in it's it's probably this is hard to talk about when other people are going through tragedy you realize that you can give the gift of time to somebody else who it's running out of there's no surgery that I can do that can do that that can give that back and the crazy part I'm not even doing surgery so I've never told anybody I have a famous term where I say it's brain surgery without a scalpel this is the exact idea that I came up with why I decided to be good at this because I knew that I could give people back time if I was really good at doing that and the reason I sat down and talked to that lady is cuz I knew how important it was to her and then I thought about the family and I thought about the kid and that that mother I'll never forget her it was heart-wrenching for her and I told her that her son would still be alive just in a different format and I remember it like it was yesterday but when that lady walked in and it was like reality hit me in the face I was telling the mom that and it turned out I got the lesson and I think I think it happened before I went through my own come to Jesus moment because this was preconditioning me to realize that I had to go on this journey and uh when you realize that a lot of things that you're doing to people isn't the right thing and this is the right thing that's when you have to go all in and I said a couple things to you when we were talking about the JFK thing that incentives dictate outcomes that's the day that incentive stopped dictating outcomes for me that's when things began to change for me that's when I started doing things based on time and not based on money and um that's why that story you know I don't like to think about it because for me there's very few cases in a nurse surgery career where you know that you were changed that was a big one wow man especially I can't imagine the amount of death you see oh well if I told you what I've seen just in the last four years from Co I mean I told Shantal this I'd go back and work a week at trauma call and I'd see at least 13 blood clots and at least five or six turbo cancers like people would have cancer that and there was no explanation and I can tell you I started doing some really I think Hospital Systems would say it's [ __ ] up but I this goes back back to this story with the kid with uh the thing I I told the people they want to know how did this happen I said well it's pretty simple go send your tissue to Philip buckolz in South Carolina and let him sample it if you got sv40 in it I can tell you exactly how it happened so anybody listens to your podcast their attorneys now you have you know the answer and how do I know that I'm accurate about that this this is another mind [ __ ] to the other story but we're now talking about medicine um when I was going through the process of trying to figure out this sv40 thing very very early on in 1992 I became aware of a PhD researcher who is looking at the misoa data and misoa is a very rare cancer like I can tell you my career when I first started no one ever got it then people started getting it and now they blamed everything on asbest and I never bought that story so you can imagine about five or six years later when I find out the story about JFK the polio shot and everything else I'm going could this new cancer that nobody knows about be linked to sv40 so I go to the medical school library at LSU and I find this um cardi thoracic surgeon who's kind of famous he he's done more mesothelioma surgeries than anybody else because it's pretty rare to do surgery on these people MH he has 472 specimens in his office PhD goes and researches it they check it all every single case of misoa had sv40 in it so Steve can pull this one up I can tell you the article was written in the Atlantic because I remember when I did my homework on it I couldn't believe it when I saw it you know and that's just another data point for me where you have a weird cancer and you ask the question so the story that I told you in the beginning of this podcast here it is again in a fractal in my medical career I asked a question is misoa really an asbesto story an sv40 story when I found out that's the case here I am now at the end of my career we're talking a last six months you know that I've been doing neuros surgery I started telling everybody who got a turbo cancer go send your tell your pathologist to send your cancer to the University of South Carolina why because Philip buckolz has blocked me on Twitter I'm sure at some point he's going to see some of this and he's going to realize he made a mistake yeah but he was a bad ombre who became a good ombre because he validated Kevin's findings so now if he really wants to be a good PhD researcher he will take these people who've been injured and tell them why they have turbo cancer and the surgeon who did the Miso Thea stuffff uh you know he just did because he was a cowboy but he doesn't realize how incredibly important that one decision was in his life for a guy like me cuz I couldn't sit here with you and have this discussion that was one of the big things that happened and I feel the same way about the people today so you know when we talk about the kid with the transplant we talk about those stories I will tell you there's there's very few cases that bothered me like the kid with the french fries there's another one from my residency believe it or not that shantel's involved with oh really yeah um it'd probably be better for you probably to interview her about it because um it kind of teaches you a little bit about the type of guy that I am I was a chief resident at Charity Hospital and we had a little girl come in about 3:00 in the afternoon she got home from one of her you know her Catholic private schools some guy was waiting there to her and the guy got in and she fought like a fing animal she had this guy's DNA everywhere I mean she fought and the way he find he didn't he I don't think he ever got cuz she fought like a Wolverine but uh he took a brass lamp and smashed the side of her head and literally her head was pushed into the opposite side I'm talking about like all the skull and everything and of course she comes in and you probably don't know this but Shantel was my operating room nurse when I was a resident Yeah you mentioned that though and um this girl comes up and I call Shantel and I said look open every [ __ ] thing we have because of course when the EMTs came in and nurses in the emergency room they told me the story of this little girl and I'm like there's no way she's dying on my dime and I looked at her the the nurses actually told me look at her fingernails she fought and I said well I'm going to fight for her so the staff doctor that is on and this is so funny because this doc was kind of involved in Monkey research so again yeah it's it's actually tied to the other story that's why I said this is quantum entanglement yeah and and um I take the little girl up and I'm up there shift Chang for the nurses was right around 6:00 so shantel's going home and I'm blasting Metallica I just keep putting the Black album on constantly and I basically told everybody just can get out of my way and the staff Doctor Who's there comes in the room and he's like Jack enough you mean you're putting blood products into this kid you're doing this this that this is just not going to end well I'm looking at the scan and this and that and I look at him remember I'm just the chief resent I basically tell the staff doctor go [ __ ] yourself I said you get out of my operating room dude I could be fired for this I was like literally six months away from being done wow and I told them just get the out of my room and and all the nurses like all the other residents I told everybody else I said if you have a problem with this leave and guess what everybody went like fire ants everybody went all in dude when I tell you I've never had a case in my career that I opened like 50 trays to get different instruments out Shantel comes back to work the next day and I'm still operating on a little oh my God so guess what the sun is coming up Metallica is still on and I make the decision I take the final piece of bone out of you know her basil gangling oh my [ __ ] and I'm going now close to 20 hours straight don't eat Don't drink don't even take a break and uh Shantel comes back in and I look at her and she looks at me I said now I want you to go find me the biggest piece of lopiz dura you can get and this is a dural replacement cuz I actually how to cut this all out when I tell you a what replacement oh the dur the covering of the brain and she goes what are you going to do with something that big and I said this little girl's brain is going to swell so much it's going to look like a basketball so she had no bone left on that side of her head so my idea was to leave a big huge balloon and let her swell into it at that time uh I hit her with more methylene blue than any patient I've ever done in my entire career the reason why is I was trying to control those swelling that also comes up in the rec podcast what year is this this is 1998 for people who are uninitiated can you explain what methylene blue is methine blue well let's talk about it in real terms real terms is uh I just talked about it with Nicole shanan and Mary Bowen that you know she got fired or or the Texas Medical Board went after for Ivor mton for Co MH remember the talk that I told you I had with Becker yes and he told me to be careful right so guess what I told people to use Hydrochloric coin and methylene blue you know why for yeah Hydrochloric coin comes from methylene blue and methylene blue works for Co and you would never know that unless you did your homework so the the Medical Board never I didn't have to face what Mary did see remember when you work smarter or when you know better you do better or your patients do better that was a lesson that I got from Becker so I hit this girl with the methylene blue and what the methylene blue does it improves mitochondrial function M so that the brain won't swell when you have a case like this the thing that you're really worried about is the brain will swell outside the head yeah and it won't end well and remember she's I think she was 15 or 16 years old you know her mom told me that she was getting ready to go to college and this and that and I'm going I'm I'm doing everything I possibly can is there any way at this point to keep someone in like I to keep I know you can keep them alive but can you keep them cognitively able to get through the get through the day I think I'm telling you that story right now okay so the little girl goes through um surgery of course I take some [ __ ] from the staff doctor but when the staff doctor saw the posttop scans and he's like she doesn't have any bone left anywhere in her brain you got every single fragment out and this is in the day before we had neural navigation I did this bro like feeling with my fingers oh and um when I took it all out um I finished my residency so I don't know what she does cuz you know after she gets through the acute phase she goes through rehab and then for us she's lost to history uh I get a a call when I'm in private practice in Tennessee her mother calls my office and says we'd like to send Dr Kruse a letter d d the office manager at the time is her name's Karen Smith she comes in and says Jack can can we give him this I said yeah I think I know who this is she writes me a letter her daughter got out of rehab she's back to walking she's almost back to talking I get another letter I think it was two years later she's in college I got a letter I I think about three years after that she graduated no way so this this is that lesson that I'm trying to teach you it ain't over until we say it's over I told you that story with politics but I'm telling you that little girl that happened at the right time in my life I was an ass kicker when I was a resident but let me just tell you something I learned more from that case than probably any case that I've ever done um and when you know something you go all in you don't you don't hold back that's the lesson and I got news for you most neurosurgeons who listen to this are like there's no way that I would have been allowed to do that as a chief resident well I don't think anybody would have been allowed to do that either but they let me do it because they knew they knew a lot about me they knew who I was I was a [ __ ] Rebel even when I was a resident um but I was adamant that I was not giving her up and um I will tell you I've given up on other patients since then but not I didn't have the feeling that I had for this girl I knew this girl was going to love wow how do you how many neurosurgeons like the top neurosurgeons in the world that you've talked to how many of them are implementing the same the same things that you're talking about like with methylene blue and I think there was a case you talked about on Rick's pod with where you you doused some ladies some lady came to you wanted brain surgery and you said only if I can douse your brain in hydrogen peroxide and methylene blue I I actually learned that when I was in residency training from actually Dr Klein I mean I remember this is old school neurosurgery and he would tell me you know all the things that he did and of course I didn't believe anything he said so I went and I started reading about it I said well this totally makes sense hydren peroxide is a a free radical we put it on the surface of the brain where the mitochondria are we're Crea hydrogen oxygen and more electrons I'm like this makes total [ __ ] sense and the problem was none of the other residents really thought it worked because they thought you know he's an old school guy and this is [ __ ] and then the other thing that I started noticing when I did that it was a great way to get blood out of the sub renoid space a lot of neurosurgeons know it from that aspect like when we do aneurysm surgery because we know if we leave any blood in that area it causes vasospasm and people can develop Strokes down the road so you want to try to get as all the blood out you as you can and you know we have treatments that we use for that but the treatments are not really good we have drugs that are designed for that the drugs really aren't good and um when I came out of residency probably five six years later the hydron peroxide story got changed where I added UV light and infrared that I would put on the brain red light yeah and guess what happened the brain swelling outcomes did well remember the story I told you that I didn't have any any suits or anything else I did high volume neurosurgery in my practice I did a lot of cranial surgery all these things that I started doing were part of the reason why I didn't get sueded I remember do doing spine surgery on people had opened dur from me doing a a lumbar fusion and putting UV light like I guarantee you this people on my surgical team are going to listen to this they're going to say we thought he was [ __ ] crazy but I wasn't crazy cuz guess what the science it wasn't well known now but now it's much better known so I'm telling you know 20 years after me starting to do this like five to 10 years in my practice I've become less crazy over time right and that's the reason why I'm telling you that you you have to be serious about your craft and I I think the more serious you are about your craft and you understand what you're doing it's important and unfortunately I trained at a time where doctors worked for the patient today most neurosurgeons they're working for a hospital system so that means there's an oracle problem doctors aren't working for you they're working for the hospital right and you need to understand that patients don't understand that right now that's one of the biggest problems in centralized medicine when it comes to the red light the the infrared red light there's these um these panels you can buy online there's various brands of them and some of them have infrared light mhm is this what you're what you're specifically talking about when you're shining this on the brain yeah in brain surgery there's two things I want to do I need to have a light that covers infrared a which is 600 to 1,000 enemy light but the big big uh switch is I have to have near infrared near infrared near infrared yes goes a little further because there's a photo switch that I learned about after I had my cumg moment it's 1280 NM light that photo Swit is actually important with 380 n met light that's actually the big control switch between anabolic and catabolic metabolism and what does that effectively mean when you use those specific frequencies of light you can optimize metabolism why the patients asleep so if any of my anesthesiologists listens to this and they want to know why I was doing what I did I never told anybody what I was doing because I was always afraid I'd wind up in front of the medical board but I was guaranteeing that people would wake up from anesthesia like this because I knew that was one of the big risks that we need to have people recover fast and it turns out if you understand the two photo switches for metabolism which is 380 n metor light that controls the M tour switch uh 1280 light controls the free radical switch and that's the the decision between the use of ATP and free radicals most people don't realize that uh cuz they don't know mitochondrial medicine well right uh nitric oxide is also a free radical and it has an unpaired electron nitric oxide when it gets into your mitochondria actually turns ATP production off like most doctors who will listen to this think that we need to use ATP all the time it turns out when we're in the sun we actually reduce the amount of ATP we make we're actually living off the light of the sun through energizing our blood plasma which has water in it 93% right so one of the key basis I told you is light water magnetism turns out when you're able to bury more light energy in water networks in a Cell patients do better that's one of the key foundational principles that I'm telling you how do I learn all that I learned it from the story of photosynthesis why because of chlorophyll and hemoglobin they look exactly the same and you said that you listened to the Uber podcast and I know there was a lot of Science in there but you might remember that I told you the two most important biologic semiconductors before the KT event or hemoglobin and chlorophyll why because they have a nitride cage around it or remember what's the most dominant gas in in the atmosphere turns out it's nitrogen so before oxygen was available these were the two key semiconductive proteins that we use to make electrons so when I realized that and I started to think about what happened from the KT event to us I said there's got to be other pieces and parts of the story and what was the pieces and parts that I realized that the semiconductive proteins were giving their light that Becker found in his work to the water networks and that would actually turn water into a quantum mechanical battery so this is in 2005 now remember there's none of this is published in a textbook at this time but guess what everything I just told you today is now published in papers and textbooks that's [[Dr. Jack Kruse|Jack Kruse]] that's decentralized medicine there was also a point you guys were you guys were having a discussion and I think he uh huberman corroborated this about the amount of information that's in the textbooks that you get in that you get in your medical training uhhuh and uh you were having a conversation with somebody and he was saying Eddie Chang Eddie Chang yeah yeah the guy from USC USF mhm and he said maybe 50% of it 99 100 it's all [ __ ] look I tell that's hard to to to comprehend no it's not when you understand why like yeah but even for you it's not you just heard the JFK story I gave you so what can I tell you every single nutrition study every single uh study that any PhD or doctor reads has no light controls so we're making the assumption that how it really works and you don't have light controls and I just told you how important light is I mean is it that hard to believe what I said is probably true and then here's the the bigger part of the story arm might CRA makes a special kind of water it's called dyum depleted water you don't get any dyum depleted water coming out of your TAP at home so what happens if you ran all the experiments with that type of water and it turns out that water has a high dialectric constant what does that mean in English means it makes more electrons what's the story of Life the more electrons you have the better you do what do electrons do funny little Jewish guy from Burn Einstein photoelectric effect more electrons you have the more light you could absorb it's not that hard to get dude when you see the magic you go this is really a game of net negative charge in electrons so that you can absorb more light the more light you put in the system okay the brain shrinks down so when you ask me the question Chuck why are you using methylene blue CU I knew it was a path to get me more electrons and if I get more electrons and I'm Shining Light on the brain that actually helps the brain that makes me a better surgeon and all the lights that you guys use during surgery those big bright lights they're blue lights right yeah there Xenon and like it I told everybody to go get a spectroscope and put it on their operating room microscope put it on their loops on their head put it on the lights in the room and then correlate that with how your patients do certain ones and the the funny thing I also said in that podcast I remember uh I specifically changed where I did surgery into a hospital that didn't have the best equipment in the world but you know what they had they had a courtyard that I could bring my patients outside in the sun and the anesthesiologist didn't with me you know and fight with me about doing this and they were stunned they were like I can't believe this guy's patients just wake up and they do great when they shouldn't like the other doctors who operate on people at Parkinson's and Alzheimer's it would they would be in the ICU for 2 or 3 days cuz they had Sund Downing and everything else and I would do my subdural and bring the patient outside and they're like this guy's going home the next day that is how powerful sunlight is for our biology but you know what the problem is you never get to open this door and centralize medicine because they don't even know exist it's kind of like what I did with you about all your other conspiracy theories I gave you the part that you were missing it turned out that part tied up a lot of loose ends I'm telling you the same thing happened to me that's really the reason why Jack dorsy and and Rick became my patients because they were like they talked to me and they saw how serious I was about my craft and they're like I trust this guy and that's what really happens and then when someone listens to you and and then it begins to work and you know Rick's like bro this doesn't cost me anything all it cost me is time and I have to retool my life to do different things and same thing with Jack when he realized that you know what he was doing as a tech abuser was harming him you know cognitively and mentally and he changed that now both of them are Zen Masters they've been doing my stuff for 15 years you know so I guess the story the way it unfolds it kind of goes to what I'm trying to tell you about medicine do the right thing bro like don't don't do the thing that benefits you do the thing that you know is the right thing to do cuz I really believe in karma I think I think the universe pays us back and um and I think you have to be authentic in how you do it I I'm pretty authentic on social media I'm pretty a seric I'm salty I curse I I'm I'm everything a neurosurgeon shouldn't be but when you sit down with me and talk to me you'll find out I'm as smart as a motherucker and I like telling dumb [ __ ] how stupid they are I do it on purpose why because my mentality is I know what Mary Bowen said they are all compliant that's why they got into medical school to begin with so I take the tact that I got to be the drill sergeant and guess what you see what a drill sergeant does to a bunch of retards in eight or 10 weeks turns them into soldiers bro I told you I need use the public to be Savages and I need the people in centralized medicine who are going to hope adapt and start fighting for you guys again you are a nightmare to the high priest in their Ivory Towers of Doc of Academia but I'd have it no other way I feel like I was I feel like I was built for this moment this is I can tell you I told Nicole this and I've said it to Bobby and Rick there's a proper time for your life's work to come out this is that time this is when I can make the biggest impact can you explain how do we create light inside of our bodies that's easy and why is that important well it's everything I mean it allows you to live at high latitudes but if you think about it it it totally makes sense you have to know a little science so there's this guy named Fritz pop he's a biophysicist he was big in the 60s and 70s when Becker was doing his work on bone M so when [[Robert O Becker|Becker]] came out and did his seminal research and he showed that um bone has a p andn semiconductor collagen and appetite and that the current is rectified that told you as a scientist that means there's got to be a photoelectric effect happening on bone so he brought a physicist in because he didn't know how to do it I think the guy's name is Charlie Bowman Charlie Bowman comes in and checks it and goes look at this when we check for the photoelectric effect both ways with collagen and with appetite it it glows uh brown red and when you do it the other way it glows blue so he figured it out right away so what does Fritz pop do well if that's true then that means that we should have a light signature like for example anytime a doctor is listening to your podcast they're going to say well I cut somebody open I don't see any light well you're not you won't see it because it's Ultra weak biophotons you know you'd have to have specialized equipment to see it you need a photo multiplier M so what does Fritz pop do in the 60s he makes photo multipliers he invents a machine that can do this so what does he do he takes leaves he takes every single thing that's living puts it in the photo multipli and F and guess what he finds out it creates light so when I learned about this I'm going okay I know Becker's experiments and I knew those experiments just so you know in 88 8990 okay we're talking a long time ago and then I went back and I said okay somebody's got to be studying this light story and it turns out it was Fritz pop now there's a lot of things about Fritz pop story that's he [ __ ] the bet on but the number one thing that he proved is light is created by us so then it became to come in upon me to figure what that out was in those 18 months that I told you I went from being centralized to decentralized I spent almost $100,000 um um translating Russian journals about scientists that were doing this work both in Japan and Russia and found out that mitochondrial uh d actually creates light through the process of breaking electrons and protons down from food and I kept reading it and and the number one thing that I remember from the papers still to this day that you had to have oxygen um and you had to have electron chain transport working for this to happen and I was just fascinated by this and I said okay I need to delve into this more so then I started open physics books and I started learning more physics and it was like one thing led to another kind of like what you do on a podcast when you get on a story you go okay now we got to go here now we got to go here now we got to go that's exactly what I did that's why I'm telling you I'm a diagnostician and I I am the most curious person you'll ever have on this podcast you put something in front of me that's a mystery and bro I'm going to not stop until I figure it out so that's what I did with this and then long story short after I figured it out and I started using different things to make light in us to improve things I realized immediately as soon as I knew we made light in us I had to look for the target of the light then I found the target it was pomy pomy is where [[Melanin]]'s made from pomc is a gene that only gets translated from UV light and then I said okay this makes sense Fritz pop found that every single living cell emits Ultra weak biof photons in the UV light so you can imagine soon as I heard that I'm like okay [[Bill Gates]] dermatologist and optomologist or [ __ ] because biolog is making UV light that means it's not toxic that means it's being used for optical photonic signaling that we don't know about okay mhm and I went further I kept going that's when I I realized what Palm SE was all about I had learned about it in medical school I learned about it in even high school but I didn't know anything about it and then I read the monk who SS his Ferrari I said yeah the dude said he went up to the top of the mountain in the cold and he got tan and all of a sudden everything started making sense I was like oh I got this and you know all I kept doing is what I told you diagnostician go back to First principles and I started putting it together and then I went back to the neurosurgery library and I found this crazy pathway it's called the letin Milano courton pathway and I was like this is the hole shot you know and I I went down that rabbit hole and I didn't stop I kept reading everything I possibly could cuz you remember I told you [[Leptin]] was not discovered till '94 I was already out of medical school by that time MH um and I learned about that and I started putting the whole story together and I said you know what light is the biggest part of the story because we're creating light and we absorb light and we have all these proteins in us that are chroma for proteins I said God or Evolution wouldn't have done this if it wasn't important you know I started finding UVA detectors on our cornea and our skin I never learned that in medical school when I saw that I'm like there's a story here that hasn't been told and that's kind of how it all went you know from me translating paper spending money and at the end of the 18 months that's when I stood in front of my family at the time on Thanksgiving day and I said in one year I'm going to go from a fat ass to wear my brother-in-law's jeans and it happened so is it true that uh near infrared light and red light can actually um build new neurons in the eyes and help Vision yep like repair Vision did you talk to shant no not about this oh her dad is the the classic example so oh wow I had a I had a uh an Opthomologist on here an optometrist and I was asking him about that and it was one thing he didn't really know much about yeah well most people won't because they haven't read the literature they need to read right but this happened I think three years ago uh shantel's dad was up in my clinic in Louisiana blowing pine needles out of the gutter and this guy just so you know he's well now he's 83 but at the time this happened he was 80 he's a Marine falls off the roof lands on the ground he breaks his leg the reason he breaks his leg he's got a knee replacement so if you know anything about a knee replacement it looks like a metal plate with a keel in it the Keel when he hits splits the Tibby in half he also I thought he may have a concussion I thought his eyes look kind of funny and he's got AMD I knew he had AMD so I was worried that could he have popped the lens out or dislocated something so of course I sent him to the hospital so he goes to the hospital and the orthopedic surgeon tells them look because your leg is broken and you have a knee replac it we're going to have to let the bone heal and then we're going to have to redo your knee so he's looking at major problems he's everything else in his head was okay his eye was fine no issues he calls me up two weeks after the injury and he's in a cast and um he's like Jack you got to do something to help me I have so much pain and I can't [ __ ] I'm taking the perco set I said Dave take the keys to my clinic go sit in front of the red light that I have for the NFL football players for the concussion right but remember he's a jarad I said listen to what I'm telling you sit in front of the light put it on 20 minutes do it four times a day you know I'm not there you can use it no problems taught him how to turn it on taught him how to program it I said but make sure you wear those glasses the goggles when you sit in front of him he didn't listen to me so what what happens that's another thing I wanted to ask you what happens he goes back to the orthopedic surgeon this was the funny part I get a picture from Shantel of her dad on my zero turn lawnmower cutting my grass two weeks after this happens he's like my leg doesn't hurt anymore and he goes back to the orthopedic surgeon orthopedic surgeon takes an x-ray can't find the fracture oh my God the fracture is healed and here's the best part he's walking around in the orthopedic surgeon's office he's like Dave you don't even have a limp he goes I don't think we're going to have to do your knee replacement either so Dave is great six weeks later he gets an appointment to go to the opthalmologist yeah they look in his eyes he's still doing the red light even though cuz he says it makes him feel great but he's not wearing the glasses no he doesn't have AMD any anymore it's gone this is a guy that for 5 years was getting the injections into his eyeball with his doctor and the doctor looks in his eye the optomologist not an optometrist an optomologist which is a surgeon well right you call him surgeon I don't call him surgeons but the opthalmologist does eye surgery correct um but he looks at him he goes there's no evidence that you have macular degeneration anymore they even do a eye test on him and I'm sitting there and I'm going I bro I didn't know that this was possible so what do I do I go back and read the literature sure as [ __ ] there's papers out there about this issue most of them in Japan guess who's burying him big farmer wow see my friend Dom dagostino he was on this pot he lives in Tamp I know who he is you know yeah he's a ketogenic metabolic guy yeah and he got a grant from the dod to do research on ketosis for uh know all about it yeah they were getting the oxygen toxicity seizures from the rebreathers MH and he found out by putting him in ketosis that he was able to eliminate the seizures and now he's doing it with with all kinds of uh people that deal with EP epilepsy and stuff like that he would improve his outcome if he actually added UVA light if he added 380 nanometer light but you can tell him that I said that or let him listen to the podcast I told him you were coming in before and I asked him what he thought about you he said he loved you said he really loved your work but I'm going to tell you that's that's the missing piece ketosis the reason why ketosis by itself doesn't work if you don't have a way to control the M tour switch you're he'll love this when he listens to it this answer is for him tell him that David sabatini is is lost his Nobel Prize because he doesn't know what I just said but Dom could potentially steal it now if he does a a study because you know the the lady that I just told you that you need to have on Dr Alexis Jasmine yeah just so you know she is like um she is like Dom except here's the difference she trained at the best metabolic lab in the world that's the Rabinowitz clinic at I should say the Rabino Lab at Princeton University she's like a rock star the difference between her and every other PhD remember I told you that Rick wanted me to go on and and get uberman down this road yeah dude she's down this road really yeah I'm trying to I told Nicole Nicole you got to give her money to run this cuz she wants to run all these light biochemistry stories and fix all the problems like the reason Dom's got the belief he's got it's a half truth cuz nobody's ever done studies utilizing UVA light a radiation on the skin and the eye while you're doing ketosis if they did you'd understand truly how mtor works so for example U's good friends are Peter AA petera has is really he thinks the world is sabatini but he's not smart enough to figure out what I just told you but guess what Rick listened to me when he had his heart surgery and what did I tell Rick to do use methylene blue the doctor said no though Peter AA said I was crazy then six months later he comes back he goes I don't think Jack was so crazy anymore after I looked into it and see that's my beef with centralized doctors like when I know something bro I'm not going to tell one of my friends not to do something that's going to hurt them right and that's you know that's how we improve things and I don't think we can improve those things in the United States because big farmer will block this from ever seeing the light of day I told you they already blocked my TED Talk cuz I knew I was going to out them on the glp1 stuff that they were getting ready to do so just to be clear if I'm doing red light therapy with the N setting on do I have to wear the glasses or no I I wouldn't wear them you wouldn't wear cuz I don't wear them I lost them so I stopped wearing them I wouldn't wear them but I'm I'm going to tell you that everybody else to do cya they're going to tell you to wear them and all the guys cover your ass oh for like a malpractice suit or a business suit yeah well when you buy it it's a big warning on yeah the warning is always there because you're protecting the manufacturer but I would tell you when you realize that you know infrared a and near infrared light are in sunlight it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that it's probably okay the difference is you have to realize that those lights are not equivalent to the sun those lights all Flicker and they all have a polarization effect any light that comes from there are polarized sunlight is unpolarized also has no flicker effect right so fake light is never equivalent to sunlight so people always ask me Jack how come you don't have affiliate codes and get paid for red lights and you talk about all the time now you know the answer why because the real answer is the affiliate code I want is from nature I love that about you I think that's soing metal well I mean it's the way I roll bro it's it's like I want people I I always say this why am I going to episod is brought to you by right it drives me crazy but why settle for a b c or a d when you got a A available like and I know there's going to be some people out there like who listen to this podcast say but Jack you use the red light in surgery because then I don't have a choice right they're not going to let me operate outside right I wish they would really yeah you do brain surgery outside [ __ ] yeah I I'd let I'd let another neurosurgeon operate on me if I had to have are outside are you so confident in your ability to operate on the brain if it came to it if you had to operate on my brain right now in this room with all the tools we have available we have some uh some rigid uh Home Depot tools and we have a skill saw would you not a problem you you be able to operate on my brain in here right now I would tell you get seant on the phone now and ask her I I I famously said if you trained in Charity Hospital I could go down to the cafetera with a knife and a fork and do a craniotomy do you know what Dr Klein used to do a craniotomy that's when we take the skull off and do surgery let me tell you one of the things that he used to do to us in the middle of our residency you know that New Orleans has a lot of hurricanes right so we lose power he would walk into a room while we're doing a brain tumor or an epidural and say okay we just lost power he turn theing lights off take all of our power drills away and say what are you going to do so dude you ever see the stories of from the Civil War how we used to cut legs off with a giggly saw what's a giggly saw it's a saw that has two handles and a blade that wobbles like this okay the only place you see it now is in butchers and there's no butchers around so you can't see it but that's how they used to Lop off legs Dr Klein taught us how to do a craniotomy with a giggly saw in case there was ever a power dude does that happen you could lose power in the middle of brain surgery I I actually can tell you a case that oh that yeah there you go see there you go Jesus that that is an amazing machine and let me tell you something when you have a people that are just listening and not watching the the visuals this is like uh two metal handles with it looks like barbed wire between them that's exactly basically what it is but it's it's amazing and when you know how to do it like this is the the thing that we're losing in medicine like you know how people are talking about Ai and they're talking about all these adjunctive things this is the kind of [ __ ] you're not going to have neurosurgeons in the future know how to do this mhm and the problem is that's what my concern about AI is in medicine that if we make things so easy that uh a monkey could do it then what happens when you're faced with something when you have to be on the front and think about it to help the patient are you doing the best for the patient my opinion is no I think the way we're training residents now totally different and you know these are things that I talked to belly about that I think we need to change in El Salvador and I don't really care with people think in America because people in America have bought the Hook Line and Sinker from the big Tech Guys from Big Pharma and also the medical uh implant industry those guys are are probably one of the worst gouges in medicine you know they got us all believing putting screws and rods and everything is a good idea if you go open up Becker's book and realize that that destroys the photo El electric ability of bone why the are we doing this I'll tell you why right Johnny Manzel incentives dictate outcom outcomes and you know the problem is that's I know that's not something that my specialty board's going to like me saying publicly but it's theing truth my mouth's not a bakery there is sort of a little bit change of subject but there is a huge um interest out there right now in the world and online with people like you know there's this huge category of people on the internet right now are like huberman or like Peter AA that uh talk about medicine and ways to optimize the body a lot of young people pay attention to it and people are obsessed with um upping their testosterone and doing things not only naturally but like more and I see it every day lots of kids in their 20s 30s that are going to testosterone injections it seems like it's the it's like the ultimate answer the Fountain of Youth to everything like it it they all have prol and steel syndrome they have what they all have pregn and steel Syndrome from their screens this is the basis of MK ultas work it's what happens oh yes my friend it destroys your sex starid hormones by Design and you know how we can make a prediction that somebody's what destroys your sex uh the blue light the blue light right yeah yeah yeah blue light screens non9 vmf RF microwaves take it all away but what do you make about the the sort of obsession right now with young people and this testosterone therapy you're not to me they're obsessed with tech therefore that's why they're obsessed with that okay fix the tech addiction then you fix that problem but guess what happens when you take something your body naturally makes you uncouple the system you're setting yourself up for problems down the road so for example let's use Rogan as an example because this is a good one so Rogan uses it gets jacked he's in a podcast studio all the time right he's UFC stuff he's doing stuff at night so he jacks it up I guarantee you that what he's not telling you he's having to donate blood sometimes he probably has something called poly cymia what's that that's when you have too much red blood cell mass and you always have to check it out that thickens your blood correct you get clots you think that's a good idea as you get older no well guess what and then here's the worst Bobby keny said that he's on it too yeah well Bobby's 70 years old that's a little different story but here's the other problem when you're constantly in front of the the blue light mm this problem is going to be a huge issue so what's the best way for you to deal with it add back the light you're missing subtract the light that's a problem I'm not saying that you still can't take it but what you don't realize the magnitude of the problem like when somebody tells me that they're on testosterone since their 20s bro that tells me their system is completely how does it affect the brain uh for men it improves your cognition it improves your cognition absolutely that's the reason why people are very interested in it like most guys are interested in it yes but I think um I think you'll be in a very interesting situation because when you bring people in here uh you should ask every single guy that comes in here if they're taking testosterone or not and then when you do the podcast with them what's your gut feeling about is this person able to think can they put things together like I'm going to tell you something in the world that Rogan's in these guys use the fac as their story I'm going to tell you we don't bury our Mighty and our facade we bury it here and here these are the two things that also kill us poining to your brain and your heart correct those are the two things that kill us too more than anything else yeah absolutely so you'll be very shocked to know many of these guys that use testosterone they don't live as long as they should I mean think about all the NL players they die early yeah you know all the guys in wrestling they die early they all look jacked right but it turns out if you go to the Super centenarians that are in Albert Einstein taken care of by near bars law you'll find out there are little short Jewish guys that have belly fat yeah and they their their [[Leptin]] levels are up but guess what people forget this key Point Danny you said you're a dad when that baby came out of your wife's vagina it couldn't talk it couldn't walk C- section all right that's even worse but what you yeah it's terrible absolutely terrible uh forget that's another podcast she has no choice she's so little that she would have like I think I don't think she would have survived oh there's there's so much we could talk about there her placenta determines that and believe it or not the cabino system you know weed that's in you that's actually what makes the decision whether the baby fits out or not that's story for another day but here's the cool part so many questions Jesus Christ okay go ahead here's the the cool part of the story the baby is a ball of fat mhmm but what does society tell us that subcutaneous fat is a real problem what does a baby do with that fat it unwinds the fat and forms a brain the brain doesn't fully form until it's 28 years old MH remember you don't molinate your frontal loes until you're 28 right that's why you can't rent a car or rent a hotel room till you're 25 did you know that yeah I didn't know that but I didn't know that was why that's the reason why cuz you're too crazy so the point I'm trying to make to you huh think about the Obesity crisis now the way Rogan doesn't think about it why do we have this we have people getting fatter and fatter cuz things like we talked about before about the glp1 drugs and big Pharma but when you put subcutaneous fat in what are you doing you're actually protecting the mass of your brain and what do we know about children they're more susceptible to non-native EMF why because they don't have as much milin the more milon you have the better able you're to protect yourself so guess what what is milin again myin is the covering brain meaning the nerves that insulation like if we're talking about wires it's the black plastic on the outside that's the thing that gets destroyed in [[Multiple Sclerosis|Ms]] gets destroyed so when you put this all together you start to go so this is a protection system of the little baby when it's being formed so when the baby comes out maybe we should start thinking about obesity a little bit different is the Obesity crisis telling us something about MK Ultra yeah yep that's why it's happening there's an impetus in the environment that's causing us to put subcutaneous fat because we're constantly around the wrong [ __ ] light right and guess what happens the placenta in humans that's exactly what the mother does if you think about your wife when she was pregnant with your baby remember the first 19 weeks she only had a little Pooch but she had a flat belly for most of it all the organ systems are being built in that time but the the baby has no subq fat do you know when the baby gets all the subq fat the last trimester do you know what controls that [[Leptin]] in the placenta sends only blue light to the baby subtracts out UV and red you know those biophotons we talked about MH it's fattening the baby up so that it can heal its brain after it comes out of the vagina because guess what if it had a fully formed brain it wouldn't fit out the vagina right got it mhm so when you begin to see that nature actually does have some insight about why everybody's getting fat now it's because everybody's beinging Tech abused by the industrial military complex that's why they canceled Becker right but how much of the Obesity epidemic like what percent would you give it that 90% 10% for food likey you're to you're going to have Cali means in here probably down the road he's going to tell you exactly the opposite CI means doesn't know [ __ ] about Becker or anything else I just sat down with with Nicole and Mary Bowen and we had a discussion at dinner I'm not going to disclose what we said but I have a huge problem with you know his sister who went to to Stanford Medical School and didn't finish her residency that tells me something's up there and they want to pound big food I'm all about pounding big food cuz I think they're full of [ __ ] too yeah but bro so blaming them is a front for the industrial military complex right the real problem is Tech abuse and let me tell you what I said in Rick's podcast I said it in multiple podcasts right every time we have 10% increase in Tech spending in the United States the N ha's data for obesity goes up 10% explain wow you want to hear something else Nina tick Holz who's Cut From the Same Cloth as Dom dagostino she's a PhD researcher she wrote a really good book she posted something on Twitter last week about 1980 the food pyramid and all that and I said isn't this convenient that you use 1980 because it suits your goal I said look at my chart and my chart went with the an Hanes data all the way back to 1893 when we electrified the surface of the Earth and you know what you'll notice I'm right the food thing is a little bump I'm telling you plays a role mhm but it ain't a big role right well there's also the phenomena I had another guy in here telling there he did this study on the world's blue zones the plac in the world Dam Butner yeah yeah he total [ __ ] really where people live the longest one of them is like Costa Rica nosara Costa Rica where it's the that that is true because the sun is there but guess what most of the places like for example one of the blue zones supposed to be the area around lominda where all the seventh age Venice are and they eat Kelloggs cereals all day total [ __ ] go talk to anybody he also talked about Okawa right okwa Blue Zone it's it's all manufactured Dan Butner is is another guy that uh I will tell you my opinion he's also part of the problem it was very interesting when he came out so of course you know guy like me based on our time here together in the podcast you know that I fact checked that none of it's true interesting that's why I said you have to look who packs your parachute Danny MH is so incredibly important in this why because remember what's at stake you know hopefully you get a little for Uncle Jack now I I value your time more than you value your time the way I talk about it I'm telling you I want you to focus in on what's going to give you the most time back I don't want you to focus in on the [ __ ] that they can make money off of right that's the reason why these guys sell supplements they sell this they sell that no functional medicine doctors are doing the same thing centralized medical doctors are doing they're using pharmaceutical drugs through the Prescription Pad the functional medicine guys are selling you powders and all kinds of [ __ ] so what's the best way to take care of your heart in your brain in your opinion what's the what's the best protocol that you live by that mean other other than eliminating the stre sunrise every day watch the sunrise 80% paros principal you do that it's incredibly important because it sets the circadian clock in your eye M uh second most important thing I think is make sure you eat a diet that's based on the circadium biology so for example here in Tampa if it grows in Tampa you eat it if if it doesn't grow on Tampa you don't eat it that's hard because anywhere you go you buy even if you buy like we're surrounded by the ocean right and you buy fish and they fish are grown on farms like salmon all the salmon that come that you get in any kind of restaurant here do you understand why it's in farms around here because all the runoff from the pesticides which is one of the points that Bobby makes he's right about that you know so you have to realize how these things fit together but I'm still going to tell you eating farmed fish is actually still better than eating probably grass-fed meat from Iowa and the reason why is the DHA content is higher in fish yeah exponentially so and the reason I say that as a neurosurgeon you have more DHA which acts as a semiconductor in that Central retinal pathway than any other part of your brain why because the clock in your eye has to run faster than the rest of the clocks in your body why whose rule is that not Jack R's rule Einstein that's a consequence of general and special relativity wow so how do you know this works so you get it this cell phone all right has GPS on it you know that allows you to get everywhere right the G the Garmin satellite that controls this phone is 880,000 kilometers above the surface it runs 38 micros faster than the clocks on the ground time travel it's it bro so guess what the clock that controls everything in you the Master Clock which is at the top of your body runs faster than every other else the only way you can do that you have to have a higher current in it and we use a semiconductor current to do it wow science Bro decentralize Science you talk a lot about cold and how cold can help uh create light inside the body do you put any any uh weight or credibility into like these cold plunges people are doing this cold water therapy I have no problem with it but you got to remember I wrote my cold thermogen protocol before anybody did it that includes Wim Hoff 2005 and you said you had a problem with wh you said you had a little problem with Wim H yeah his breathing technique is total [ __ ] I mean and that's what he's claimed to fam is I have never really called him out on it because my belief is whims a good guy I I I do think he's a good guy if he's bringing people to cold I'm okay with it but I have different people who get the breathing thing right like Irwin Lor he's spectacular on the breathing technique so if you use Irwin's breathing technique and you use whims protocol great my protocol is very simple it's been on my website from the beginning MH just realized cool sculpting when centralized plastic surgery got on the cold game their patent their first patent is in 2008 I wrote mine in 2005 and I put it on the internet for free mhm so you have the choice how did I figure out the cold story yeah every mammal has the mamalian dive reflex yes that's actually how it works and can you explain that for people who don't know yeah when a baby comes out of its mother we were designed to be born in water so the best way to think about it is the Nirvana album cover you know that has come as you are on it you see the baby swimming in there the baby will not take a breath in while the cold water is around it then when it comes to the surface because if it's fat it floats that's when it takes its first breath um cold is built into every single mammal and it goes back to when the age of mammal started you know which I talked about in the uberman podcast but it's present in US we are the one mammal that doesn't really use it like we should why because what are the two metrics that circadian biology works on light and dark and temperature people always forget the temperature part right and that's where cold plays a role and it turns out we have a metabolic switch in our eye called endothelial nitric oxide synthease remember we talked about nitric oxide earlier the crazy part of the nitric oxide story everybody knows that when you make it from UVA light or infrared light it can help with blood pressure but you know what nobody else tells you dropping the bomb here now for the people who haven't read the patreon nitric oxide controls the stem cell depose in your body so how do you replace bad cells like you don't go to the regenerative medicine guy down the street and get an injection you learn to use nitric oxide so you get in the sun that's the best way to do it and what do you do that's how you actually take out the bad cells called apoptosis cell suicide side how do you replace him the same free radical signal does that and what do you need to do it you need 380 nanm light you need 1280 aren't those two lights that we talked about earlier mhm H so he talks about the so Wim Hoff he talks a lot about the breathing but he and then him and hubman as well talk about the cold and the you mentioned the mamalian dive reflex but how how does freezing somebody how ises freezing your body cold like that how could that possibly it's easy it's good no it's it's really good and I'll explain to you why you have to know a little bit of science but I'll use basic ideas so you get it so if we sent Steve out right now my iPhone and we put it on the hood of the car that drove me here and we left it in the Tampa Sun would I get a temperature warning on this yes and then I could put that thing in the freezer will work right away right M semiconductive circuits work better by cold remember we don't we're you're thinking about your F250 that you turn the key when it's 22 degrees in Tampa that happens once a year in December or January that's a different kind of current that's a DC electric current that builds resistance up in a line that's different semiconductive currents work better in the cold here's where the key metric is when we are in the cold all mammals we turn on the sympathetic nervous system the sympathetic nervous system activates the [[Leptin]] Milano Corton pathway what happens we take our fat in the subq space bring it to the mitochondria and we create huge amounts of light that's Fritz pops work so guess what that allowed us unlike the Neanderthals to live at higher latitudes than they did that's why we persisted and they died off and how did we do that the difference between humans and the anals is We Shrunk our brain so on a relative basis we have 125 gram less brain tissue but what does that mean in neanderthals no right we have we actually are cognitively de evolved compared to them in terms of volume but you know what that did When We Shrunk The neurons we raised the amount of [[Melanin]] and water at the same time so guess what [[Melanin]] and water do it's the ultimate battery in in humans why because what did I tell you anytime light hits melanin it creates electrons hydrogen and oxygen and we create more electrons from that interaction than chlorophyll does with sunlight chlorophyll the first step of photosynthesis only creates two electrons melanin the minimum is four but it can create way more because it's a wideband semiconductor you heard me say that multiple times to uberman when you have a wideband semiconductor it means that there's more possibilities for light to be created and that's the reason why melanin got expanded from the KT event to us so if you remember in the podcast that we talked to him I try to be provocative with his stupid little seop pods that he talked about that are in his lab and I said bro it's amazing to me that you can use these seop pods you see their brain and all the light in there what do they do with their melon they spit it out to protect themselves I said what happened in 650 million years from the camaran explosion when seop pods evolved we kept all our melon in and we put it inside our body we don't use it anymore in fact we do most of the melanin is in our B&amp;T cells we use that as our immune system fight off pathogens that's how it works and when you cut the brain open you don't see the light show like you see in sop pons we Rectify all the currents Allah [[Robert O Becker|Robert Becker]] because the currents are doped so we have small little atoms in there that actually change the different frequencies that's exactly what the guys in Silicon Valley do you know with AMD or Intel um they all have doped silicon semiconductors we have doped uh carbon based semiconductors so that's how we create different light frequencies and the dopent that's present in bone that Becker found is co uh copper we have two copper atoms that are between collagen and appetite and that allows us to have the semiconductive current and they're only electrostatically bound what does that mean when you put a human up into space or your Elon Musk you're going to knock those two electrons off and you're going to get Space osteoporosis so the osteoporosis that you get in space isn't the osteoporosis that your grandmother gets down here it's a little bit different right so that tells you just like Becker said this is why he told the government they were wrong about what they believed he said I know what's going on and he goes I know why those Russian astronauts died in 1971 in the soya's capsule CU they stayed up there too long and they all got horrible osteoporosis right that's the reason why bro yeah that's what I said I'm trying to I'm trying you're kind of like blowing my like when you hear Elon talking about us becoming an interplanetary species and I list then I listen to you talk about this stuff it doesn't make sense to me it doesn't I don't know how human beings could survive on on Mars bro they're going to be there but they're going to be sick as [ __ ] and they're never coming back or it's going to die there right now I will tell you is it theoretically possible yeah when we create an an alien magnetic field that supports our life cuz that's what you're missing and then you deliver light frequencies that we get on Earth remember you you're also going to have to build an artificial ionosphere terraform an atmosphere correct so bro how about we do that [ __ ] before we send somebody up there but you know why you have to remember something and this this will be a nice tie in for what we talked about before Elon Musk is an engineer do you know who else was an engineer [[General Leslie Groves]] do you know that he was a product engineer that worked for the Army Corps of Engineers do you think he made mistakes now he was able to build a new nuclear bomb just like Elon Musk built SpaceX and can get Rockets back and forth I'm trying to tell you he's a talented guy but is he got everything together did General gross have it together and what did I tell you if you have something wrong can you be a product engineer make a bomb steal science and turn out to be worse than Hitler I did say that didn't I so what am I trying to tell you you as a young guy I'm trying to kill all your Heroes like let me explain to you [[Steve Jobs]] right Hardware guy dead before he's 60 Paul Allen software guy from Microsoft dead at 62 halny unbelievable guy in Bitcoin dead before 60 years all billionaires you think they're great I think it's the biggest epic feel to have9 billion and not be able to spend the time with your kids or your family right but guess what I think about that all the time well guess what I went to Prague to bitcoin Prague to us those three guys and you already heard how I got the story how I value time I got it from that kid with the french fries dude I it didn't [ __ ] magically come into me this is all entanglement from my career what my job is when I come to a podcast like this I'm trying to get in there and take off my wooden shoes they're called saos that's where the word sabotage comes from and throw into your clock ears I want you to think better than you did before I walked in that room and dropped my suitcases on and you said let's go MH before Steve said we're live MH I want you to think about some of the things that we're talking about why because I think you have a duty to me now and a duty to the public when you have other people come in here you got to start asking some good questions you say okay you're allowed to say that Mr Newman but talk to me about what Jack just said here how's this change like go back that's what we do in Eminem conference Eminem conference is morbidity mortality so we do something bad to somebody we all get up in a room and they [ __ ] pound US I want you to start doing that on podcast somebody comes in here and you know that they're selling you a line of [ __ ] M hit them don't be scared your audience is going to love you now some people are going to be loud on your YouTube comments and tell you you're an [ __ ] and Jack did something to and he should have never done that bro that's okay I'm that guy I I I'd be the first one to tell you I like to be agent provocator but I'm going to tell you failures create our success wounds create our wisdom we don't learn anything from success right that's the message man in the arena correct and when the government's giving you circus Maximus run away what can you tell by somebody you you're you're good at diagnosing people what can you tell by someone by just looking in their eyes well when I do anoscopic exam remember the retina itself is a dlon it's actually part of your brain most people don't know that you know it's actually brain surgery and I'm actually able to examine your brain things that I'm looking for I'm looking at your optic disc I'm looking at your phobia that's where your central vision is but I'm very interested on what's happening right around your phobia with your thic artery that tells me how much blue light toxicity you got your pupilary reflex I use three different lights to check it okay what am I looking for I'm looking for evidence that your midbrain is involved uh with tech abuse then I'll do some other things like if I put the light in your eye and you sneeze that tells me you have a problem with myelination in your olfactory cortex in your brain well when I yeah when I go out in the sun I often sneeze tell me that you've got an issue it also tells me something else you have a problem with creating vas oppressing from the posterior pituitary means that you got too much light on at night so I can tell a lot but these are all things that centralized doctors they don't know and they don't check and I will tell you I didn't check any of these things until 20 years ago 20 years ago is when I realized that there was a lot of fat on the bone that we have to teach people and that's kind of what I do with my doctor members I teach them that you know I do all these patreon blogs all the time right and if you follow my Twitter handle I mean I blow people's minds daily with Twitter stuff but I do it for that reason not trying to show people that I know more than they do I'm trying to get people motivated that what you've been told is horeshit upgrade your game right there was an interesting uh thing you guys also brought up about you're talking about Jackson Pollock and when you said you're trying to heal people and fix their brains and and and fix people's ailments you're of you're often taking away certain gifts they have yes and that reminds me uh especially when you brought up Jackson poock there was a book I read about neuroplasticity uh with uh weasel and I forget the guy one of the guys name was something weasel two these two um scientists that figured out neuroplasticity figured out that it goes way past like conventional theory is that it neuroplasticity ends in like your early teens or before that maybe true but it goes way past that right yeah and the number one thing the point that I tried to bring if to you to his credit he did bring up the other doc you're talking about I think it's uh M movich which was one of his mentors and this guy died but he's really big into why we got Kar implants and also his original research that clued us into this was on the median nerve and I told you Dr kleene was he's the world expert in peripheral ner surgery in the world he's now like 90 years old probably close to death if he's not dead already but his work actually as a young resident taught me that the dominant Paradigm belief because I was taught that the brain doesn't change that guy's research told me that was [ __ ] the single most important thing I try to bring to uberman is that there's no more plastic part of the neurologic system than melanin melanin is neurop plastic to light like that bro and everybody should get that you remember you heard in the same podcast when Rick said yeah I leave Costa Rica and I go to Malibu and I lose my tan you know and then I talk the reverse of that remember the black lady viigo yes yes right we switched that around that those are the reason I did those things CU I realized that there's things that are in us that are way more plastic than not and it turns out the things that are the most plastic are the things that get us better and that was the tie-in for me with Becker because Becker found that the source of all regeneration is the DC electric current takes red blood cells and turns them into the cell you need the key is you have to have the right light to get the right current to get the right cell and it doesn't matter what cell it is and I've already told you the interesting thing we do this with red blood cells and Bone my belief is that we're using stem cells to do it with other tissues and if you don't create the right light you don't get the right current then you don't get the Regeneration and that's what we see with people that say have uh quesence or or have cence those are people that they can't make any more stem cells from their body and they get it and that's what most of the people who have had osteoporosis for probably the last 50 or 60 years get their their their bones are ccent because they don't have any stem cells left inside their marrow and that's unfortunate situation the reason why that's important to understand is the more that were in involved in a tech life you're depleting stem cells right so that means you can't live long so if you want to follow these longevity guys and I think they're all [ __ ] shyers even the guys that are running the stem cell things where they're saying take your baby and get your placenta of your baby and okay with that but don't listen to anything else CU they don't know their ass from their elbow uhuh um and none of them know like every single stem cell that's frozen should be instead of being frozen should also have a UV light and infrared a light inside the freezer but we don't have that we don't have that because you'll extend the shelf life you know like we talk about preservatives and food you know that keep like you know McDonald's hamburgers for 14 years M they they need to start thinking about doing that with stem cells and I believe light is how we do it and you know people listen to this podcast and say that's crazy you may not know this but your wife when she was born I should say before she was born all the eggs that she'd ever produced was in her right within four or five weeks of her being in her mother and she's kept all those eggs up until she has a last period for how long guess what hormone picks the eggs [[Leptin]] it's the [[Leptin]] Milano coron pathway wow that's why I said when you see it and you you know that uh Nicole's big into human fertility especially female fertility well Alexis Jasmine the same way fertility is also tied to this which came into your testosterone story so when the kids the boys put their phone in their front pocket they're radiating all their swimmers not only are they destroying their testosterone but they're killing their germ cells remember those germ cells like you have all these idiots that come and do podcast about artificial intelligence if you ask them artificial intelligence has no target you know what I tell people you know what artificial intelligence really is it's your kids your kid is part your wife part you he's a [ __ ] alien H and you don't think about it that way but guess what what are we doing to our kids we think okay after four or five years we put them in daycare they're getting radiated in daycare then we put them in school and we're radiating there are we really taking care of our stem cells or our artificial intelligence when we do that right but that's what the transhumanist want you to do H and what did I say to you before if you're going to bank your eggs because you're a tech abuser because you're infertile maybe you need to take care of the eggs better than you took care of them and we're not doing that right so guess what when we take an egg out and do IVF after it's been frozen why does anybody think that's a good idea when you understand what I'm telling you right here yeah that's interesting that's interesting because I I actually recently had a biological anthrop Anthropologist on here a couple weeks ago and he was explaining to me that there's a there's a lot of debate about IVF and they they're saying like you're selecting against nature when you're doing that you are I I totally agree with that and this is the reason why I will even tell you and this was the punch in the mouth that I had a delivered to Nicole I said you realize that you and Sergey your previous life what you did you ruined your germ cells that's why that baby has got what it's got now that she's out you got to do reverse all the things that you guys did and dude this was a straight punch in the mouth to her I was not kind about it but when she said to me about the $100 million I said I didn't want it I said but I'll tell you what I want you to do I said I want you to give $5 million to angin to make the blue light computer that blocks all the blue light cuz your husband's trying to put him out of business and all his friends in Silicon Valley my God she did that and then I said go talk to Francisco Gonzalez Lima in University of Texas she gave him $20 million to study Redlight and autism when she did that she proved to me that she wasn't a douchebag so what did I do then I wrote my seminal ideas about how autism really forms and I put it in the blog for Quantum engineering 4 I gave it to Nicole before I gave it to anybody else is this online you can it's on my patreon in fact when I sat down with Andrew Wakefield and and Mary Bowen two days ago in Dallas yeah I gave both of them a copy wow I said if you want to see where I think it comes from and and I think what Andy was very interesting because to his credit he said look in 98 when they cancelled me he goes what we thought the state of autism was back then it was tied to the gut because remember he's a gastroenterologist he says I realize the science has changed a lot and he's out of the doctorine game now cuz they took his career from him MH now he makes movies but to his credit and you tell he's a brilliant guy who's just got [ __ ] chewed up because he didn't have Becker talk to him um we need people like him you know because guess what his insights the way he thinks he it's may have been atrophied cuz now he's making movies because the movies that making is actually telling the story like he just came up with a uh came out with a movie called protocol 7 I would suggest every parent watches it um and you just we just need to teach people instead of vilifying people even if you don't agree with us it's you know the mark of an educated mind to take something you don't fully believe or understand and examine it for yourself then make a decision right if you if you give crazy a shot like a lot of my people do and it works all I ask you to do what's your payment to me go tell somebody else that's it it's all I need you to do um yeah real quick I there's two things I want to I want to get to before we wrap it up we're coming up on like four hours um the book I was telling you I was reading about neuroplasticity it was um about those two guys who wrote that paper I think it was in like the 60s maybe I know who you're talking about yeah you know who I'm talking about um anyways they did they they mentioned um famous artists of the past and like how their whatever was wrong with them or wrong with their brains affected how good they were at creating art Pollock obviously you know alcoholic and and low dopamine low dopamine um they made a case for Picasso which was fascinating yeah well he remember he was he had a huge problem sex addiction and a lot of people don't know this but we've talked about on the periphery this is the stuff that hit the floor in Rick's podcast MH the P the sex addictions the homosexuality the the rise of this is actually because your hypothalamus gets bigger there's now papers out there that show that people have uh misgendering little closer transgendering things like that yeah um their hypothalamus is larger and if you know anything about thermodynamics any times a tissue loses energy it gets bigger so you always hear me talk about your an your heart when they all fail yeah you blow up right same thing happens with your hypothalamus and that's where your all your sex steroid hormones are so there's now proof that this thing is actually tied to changes in the [[Leptin]] Milano courton pathway so we are selecting out not to have children so what are we effectively doing with this transhumanist idea they know this that's the reason they're big supporters you talk to Nicole Nicole said something to me during dinner the other night that really I hope she says it in in more podcast but she said Sergey didn't care what happened to Ekko uh like after she was born and that is such a transhumanist idea that the target e goes their kid yeah okay it's a baby girl Nicole's whole leftwing liberal personality changed because of this baby like that was her punch in the mouth right he still gives [ __ ] about this kid but that's what the transhumanist that's involved in Tech that's really what the basis of the marshmallow experiment's all about they just don't get it and they never will and they've been bred this way and they not going to change uh the only way they change is if they have something in their life kind of like what happened with Nicole and Nicole now is doing everything different I mean I mean I wish I could have had that phone call and you know the funny thing is Danny you have a an opportunity Shantel listened to that phone call because I had it on speaker phone I never put any things up to my ear asked Shantel just how brutal I was I was [ __ ] brutal and I was like here you're asking me for help for your kid and you're ruining the whole planet that's kind of how I answered her question I went nut on her and to her credit she took it and I think she took it because Ekko was a bigger punch and she's like clearly I did something wrong here clearly there's something going on and she was really motivated to find out about it and so motivated that she left her liberal ideology and look what she's doing now now she's actually telling people to vote for Trump literally four years ago she was is donating millions of dollars the other way like crazy and you know everybody in the DNC thinks she's fing crazy but what I'm telling you that's actually what happened to me 20 years ago when I had my come to Jesus moment I'm like look when you realize everything you believe is aing lie it's a existential crisis like you have to sit down and figure this [ __ ] out and you know for everybody Danny it's going to be different you know what what brings us to the table who knows there may be some things that we said in this podcast people listen to and go right and but that's what it's supposed to do that's what life's about life is about the constant search of Discovery and being curious and never thinking you have it all together like I tell you every day I learn something and if I'm not learning something then I think I'm dead right that's how I look at it have you seen this I don't know if it's new now but I just saw this yesterday on YouTube there's this skin pigment they can put on your skin to make it invisible yeah how is that a new thing and how it's like a yellow thing that makes your skin seethrough yeah the we can you pull up a video of it Steve we we use different things like when we have burn patients you may not know this we use tilapia skins to do that and believe it or not it actually helps burn patients but you have to realize our skin is optimized for our B just like fishes are optimized for theirs remember they're in a different environment they're in liquid water and we are you know Silly talking monkeys that live on the surface of the planet M but there is an optical density of your skin remember what you're saying when they use something like this yeah look at that yeah when they use something like this what are they trying to do they're actually trying to get you usually past an acute trauma until you come back like you'll be shocked cuz I've been talking about bad [ __ ] about blue light all the time mhm do you know what one time Uncle Jack loves blue light is when you have a burn victim you put blue light on a burn victim you know what it does it stimulates the the uh skin to grow faster which is the reason why blue light causes skin cancer because that's the truth but believe it or not when someone has a burn using blue light unopposed blue light actually causes the burn to heal faster because you're stimulating repair one of the things that I've talked to several burn trauma surgeons about that I believe when they do use the blue light they need to add the 380 light for the reason I told you before cuz nitric oxide talks to the stem cells in the skin to re even redo it faster and one of the things that people who don't use the UV light have noticed the skin that comes back after you use the blue light always has less pigment in it and I think the reason for that is because the way nature wants this done it needs not only the nitric oxide stimulus but it also needs the UV stimulus to turn pomy on why because pomy has to migrate into the new skin as it's growing because that's exactly what happens when you're forming in your mother you know as the neural axis grows you have [[Neural Crest Cells]] migrating through their tracks to get where they need to be we don't have melanin every single spot in our body we have it in key spots like when you see somebody has dopamine uh problems with Parkinson's we know it's a sub substanti [ __ ] but there's parts of your body you don't really have a lot of melanin and some people are surprised to find out like over our Cal muscle and over our rectus abdominis which is our six-pack muscle we have more pomy in that skin than anywhere else and think about why that makes sense because in humans compared to gorillas or monkeys We Shrunk our gut 30 feet right that's why it's there and we walk upright that's where we have it in our Achilles tendon cuz it changed those things which is what I said in the rub yeah it was just what I said in the that's wild well I said that though in the Reuben podcast like these are the collateral effects of light scul must spaced out during that time CU I don't remember that well no I said it very casually because people have always assumed in the in the anthropology world that we're going to find a missing link and if you understand what I said in the the uberman podcast you're not because what's the difference between us and Them is pomy it's melanin there there is no transitional ape what do you think we're going to look like in a 100,00 years if we survive if there's no cataclysm that wipes out Humanity do you think we're going to look like these little gr aliens that people talk about Fat Bastard fat you don't think we're going to get no you know that that movie oh fat from Austin Powers Yeah you think we're going to like that in 100 thousand years yeah because I mean think about what's happening I already told you that we're Tech abusers so we're going to get bigger mhm uh I also think what will happen is we'll dumb down there'll be be part of society that runs the whole system and we're going to use AI technology to dumb us down further in other words you're going to be we don't have to think we don't have to think and if you don't have to think it's it's not a good place to be because the world will be driven by those who can think and and to be honest with you this is another fractal that takes us back to the first hour of the podcast that's really what the industrial military complex wants they want to be the wizard behind this the curtain like Steve is while we're all the fat bastards walking around the earth doing what they need you know what I also I think there's a connection between some of these Blue zone areas of the world these underdeveloped parts of the world I feel I don't know if this makes sense for longevity but I feel more alert more awake more alive I just feel better when I'm in a in a country when I'm driving around not just stopping at red lights and stop signs and just wait for the light to tell me when to go when I literally have to look for cars to stay alive to make sure that I'm driving in a way that's going to keep me alive versus driving in traffic here well think about what you just said you just proved my point and that makes me feel good that's the Oracle effect of modern life and you don't realize what you're designed to do is go run on the tectonic plates and run under a tree sit there and capture all the biophotons that come off the light through the leaves you don't do that anymore and then when you think about the car you're sitting in a car glass blocks all the UV and 40 to 60% of the red so unless you roll the window down or open the moon roof you're right so you are having an alien experience in the car yeah and that's the reason why you feel that way what are your feelings controlled melatonin and dopamine serotonin these are all aromatic amino acids that absorb light like everything always comes back to light the problem is the idiots that you listen to they don't know that yeah nobody talks about it well dude I've been talking 20 years probably more than anybody honestly the Circadian rhythm and getting and getting access to the sunlight a lot of people talk about like the muscle is important for maintaining your glycogen and and your energy stores and people don't even know that in muscle the single most important thing is actually dopamine dopamine controls the fiber type the fiber type controls the the glycogen stores they don't even get that right dude all these paleo Meat Heads like for example um dom dom listens to all this he's been a bodybuilder his whole life I know but you got to realize that is that's his half truth and the thing is I'm going to tell him his longevity is not going to be buried when his biceps are big he's a smart guy hopefully he's going to wake up down the road and say I need to begin to optimize the mitochondria in my heart and my brain can you do can you do both at once uh no because it's a zero sum game what I mean by that energy remember from the first law conservation of energy can't be created or destroyed so because what you're doing with mitochondria if you put it where it's not supposed to be you're stealing from where it's supposed to be this the reason why I don't know if you remember um one of my good friends he's dead now but he's a guy like Dom Charles Paquin and I always warned him when he was doing the things he was doing I'm like Charles I know this whole physique thing with you and I said I'm telling you you're going to get taken out like your family members did and it's going to happen before you're 60 and bro he argued with me up and down and he's he did a lot of things outside but he just didn't do enough spent too much time inside too much time with tech he died at 58 years old of hard tech and he looked like Michelangelo's you know David so the point that I'm trying to make to you I've tried to make it to several of my critics online recently I did it with Dr Alexis uh C Jasmine uh when you have a physique like that go and find me anybody who's 85 years old that looks like that you're going to find like not a lot of people right but it it does I mean muscle atrophies when you get older your testosterone's lower stop think about what you just said muscle atrophies when you're lower what is nature telling you everything atrophies the brain atrophies right not not all not true no Einstein when he died at 76 years old brain was not atrophied that's not true and I'm going to tell you that's the interesting part of the story I'm kind of glad you went down this path I didn't think we were going to but I'm going to tell you that you need to really understand that the body plan of mammals you know the the whole category of mammals when you go to the museum of natural history of New York you see tons of them and they look all different and they all have different issues you know what determines this the the really up thing about biology there's something called Ker's law Ker's law basically says the lifespan of a mouse and elephant they still have the same number of heartbeats no matter what it's true so yes what is nature telling you there is a power law at the basis of energy production and it's called C's law you can look it up okay and there's a a line see the line right there doesn't matter where you are on the evolutionary path you're always along the slope of that line so what does that tell you you're in a zero some game and I remember when I learned about Ker's law that's when I realized that having really big muscles when you're a human is a disadvantage and the point that I try to make to guys like Dom gorillas and chimps what's the differ the real difference between us and them they have more intestine and they have more muscle they don't have frontal loes so they've made that change they don't live as long as us but we do it the other way and our longevity is 20 to 30 years greater than theirs so what is nature telling you where you bury your mitochondrial density is the key so you said something to me interesting about 10 minutes ago Jack what do you see the future the future is if we keep using technology that's stealing from us it's causing electron steel that what's going to go first our brains and our hearts now that doesn't mean the first 30 or 40 Years of our life that we can't do something amazing to be honest with you that's what worries me about the transhumanist I I think that's really what they care about They Don't Really Care that Susan wji died she's 56 she's useful idiot now you know it's it's going to be the people the new people that they're training are they thinking like the the Google Engineers that are there now I think they're really important to Google but do they have a shelf life is there an expiration date for transhumanists the answer is yes and when you become a drag that's when they want to get rid of you you asked me the te question the 80,000 F foot question that's the reason I think that they think the way they think and I've discussed this with Nicole and her new boyfriend and they actually agree with me why because they used to hang out with more of those [ __ ] than anybody else I don't let any of those people around me to me they're my mortal enemy like I I would I would sit down with probably [[Adolf Hitler]] before I'd sit down with Sergey brenn that's the truth wow it's wild [ __ ] man well hopefully you have a little flavor of a little Uncle Jack's chili I've had a nice taste of Uncle Jack's chili man and uh I have a feeling and I hope you'll be back for more sometime one day in the future this was this was a fascinating conversation man thank you so much for your time I'm very grateful for it no problem um where can we tell people to visit your patreon your website everything like that uh it'Dr. Jack Kruseruse everywhere like every social media place the patreon is patreon.com backjack Kruse um my website is drj Kruse.com go to the forms the forms are free it'll take you literally 10 years hit the form button Steve yeah you got to register for the form unfortunately you guys aren't registered but if you go on there that is like the walking Library of Alexandria for [[Quantum Biology]] it'll take you 10 or 15 years to get through there if you I'm not kidding you if you put my name and your disease in a box dude Welcome to the Jungle wow that's fascinating and believe it or not that's why Rick some of my friends they want to do a movie about this because they feel like when someone dies the library of their knowledge dies with them and that's where I came up with the idea to put all this on the form so that it's there you can search it the problem is a lot of people ask me they want me to be the librarian and I think you probably already already figured out how well that goes I'm not here to be your librarian patreon is designed for you to do DIY that's where you start I think with [[Dr. Jack Kruse|Jack Kruse]] the more time you want with me like say if you got a disease then you got to become a member like gold or platinum that's when I give you one-on-one time okay you can hire me as as as someone to rent my brain for an hour I'll allow people to do that but I do not allow the the general public to do it uh you have to be a member either at the gold or Platinum level why because I need you to know some of the basics like some of the stuff you and I covered today you know about Becker's work about semiconduction about stuff like that like if I start talking to you about what I want you to do you're going to look at me and not know this you're like I just wasted money talking to this guy and you probably did but what I want to do is I want to elevate your game so that you understand where I'm coming from and then I can easily now tell you go read this book go read that book like in other words you don't have to believe me anymore in the beginning you had to now there's books out that tell you I'm right definitely man um can I get you to if I needed brain surgery would you be able to do it or or is that probably in El Salvador in El Sal oh you'll do it in El Salvador well Buell how often do you do brain surgery by the way last one I did was the last day that I practiced in the United States which was August 6th about six weeks ago no way way that's when I officially decided to become a free agent and start talking about what we talked about in the first two hours of the podcast and I started doing brain surgery without a scalpel and I basically told president buelli and just like I told Bobby Nicole and Trump I'm a free agent now you want me come get me that's beautiful man I love it well thanks again this was fascinating and uh we'll link all your stuff below for people to check it out good night everybody take care sleep tight
