# Bilderberg Group

## Short Overview

The Bilderberg Group, founded in 1954, is an annual private conference of 120–150 global elites from politics, business, and academia, aimed at fostering dialogue between North America and Europe. Its secretive nature, with no public minutes or resolutions, sparks conspiracy theories about it orchestrating global events, such as the EU’s formation or a “New World Order.” Organizers claim it’s a neutral discussion forum.[](https://medium.com/%40edsetiadi/book-review-the-bilderberg-conspiracy-inside-the-worlds-most-powerful-secret-society-by-h-d2646c23ed1b)[](https://time.com/4362872/bilderberg-group-meetings-2016-conspiracy-theories/)[](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/bilderberg-group-conspiracy-theories-secret-societies-new-world-order-alex-jones-a8377171.html)
