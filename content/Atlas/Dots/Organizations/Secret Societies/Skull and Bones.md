# Skull and Bones

## Short Overview

Skull and Bones is a secret society at Yale University, founded in 1832, known for its exclusive membership of elite students and influential alumni. Often featured in conspiracy theories, it’s accused of fostering a powerful network controlling American politics and finance, with claims of orchestrating events like the Kennedy assassination or a “New World Order.” Its secrecy and notable members fuel speculation, though it’s officially a fraternal organization.[](https://www.history.com/articles/secret-societies-freemasons-knights-templar)[](https://www4.acenet.edu/secret-societies-harvard)[](https://x.com/Colourz_0/status/1625390373009858560)
