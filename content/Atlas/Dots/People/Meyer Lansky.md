# Cohesive Narrative: Meyer Lansky’s Role and Resentment

## Overview

[[Jack Kruse, MD|Kruse]] portrays Meyer Lansky (1902–1983), a Jewish-American mobster, as the financial genius behind the National Crime Syndicate, orchestrating a decentralized empire that challenged centralized banking elites like the [[Rothschilds]] and Rockefellers. Lansky’s role spans funding the Manhattan Project through [[General Leslie Groves]], partnering with [[Howard Hughes]] to launder money, evading Hoover’s pursuit of $3 million, and supporting Zionist goals, including Israel’s 1948 establishment. His decentralized financial networks, using early computing, prefigure Bitcoin’s blockchain, with “[[Satoshi Nakamoto]]” as a nod to his anti-elite rebellion. Lansky’s resentment toward the Rothschilds and Rockefellers stems from their manipulation of common Jewish people during WWII, using them as pawns in geopolitical schemes like the [[1933 Transfer Agreement|Transfer Agreement]] while profiting from their suffering.

## Detailed Narrative

- Financial Empire and Defiance: Lansky, a Jewish immigrant from New York’s Lower East Side, built a multimillion-dollar empire through gambling (e.g., Las Vegas casinos like the Flamingo), bootlegging, and racketeering, collaborating with [[Lucky Luciano]] and [[Bugsy Siegel]]. Kruse claims Lansky used early computing technology to create untraceable financial networks, operating outside the control of banking elites like the Rothschilds and Rockefellers (These People Must Pay, 2:19:41; June 6, 2025). His ability to launder money through Swiss accounts (post-[[1934 Swiss Banking Act]]) and offshore shell companies humiliated centralized bankers, showcasing decentralized superiority, per Silbert’s lesson, “If you control the issuance of money, you control the world.”
    
- Support for General Leslie Groves: Kruse alleges Lansky clandestinely funded General Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project (1942–1946), to cover secretive costs of the atomic bomb’s development (2:22:30–2:24:00). Using his money-laundering expertise, Lansky channeled mob profits to Groves for off-the-books expenses, bypassing congressional oversight. This strengthened U.S. military power, indirectly aiding Zionist goals for Israel’s creation, aligning with Lansky’s role as a Zionist financier.
    
- Partnership with [[Howard Hughes]]: Howard Hughes, the billionaire aviation mogul, served as Lansky’s intermediary, laundering funds through companies like Hughes Aircraft and Las Vegas casinos (e.g., Desert Inn, 1940s–1950s) (2:23:15–2:24:50). Hughes’ government ties and secretive nature obscured the funds’ origins, supporting Groves’ project. Kruse suggests Lansky and Hughes shared a disdain for centralized banking elites, challenging Rothschild and [[Rockefeller]] dominance.
    
- The Missing $3 Million: [[J Edgar Hoover]] and his FBI accountants pursued Lansky for decades, believing he stole $3 million from his criminal enterprises (2:25:00–2:26:30). Lansky’s sophisticated offshore networks, leveraging Swiss banking secrecy, kept the money hidden, outsmarting Hoover’s team. Kruse frames this as Lansky taunting centralized authority, with his minimal convictions (minor gambling charges) proving his financial genius.
    
- Zionist Facilitator: Lansky funneled mob money to Zionist causes, including the [[1933 Transfer Agreement]], a Nazi-Zionist deal to transfer Jewish wealth to Palestine, supporting Jewish emigration and infrastructure (2:21:30; April 19, 2025, X post). Kruse claims Lansky’s financial influence pressured British elites to force [[Edward VIII]]’s 1936 abdication, a Nazi sympathizer, to protect Zionist plans for Israel’s establishment.
    
- Bitcoin’s Precursor: Lansky’s decentralized financial networks, using mafia-controlled casinos and offshore accounts, inspired Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer framework (2:24:50; June 6, 2025). Kruse suggests the pseudonym “[[Satoshi Nakamoto]]” honors Lansky’s secretive genius and anti-elite rebellion, with Bitcoin resisting the same centralized systems Lansky defied.
    

## Why Lansky Was Upset with Rothschilds and Rockefellers

Kruse claims Lansky harbored deep resentment toward the Rothschilds and Rockefellers for exploiting common Jewish people during WWII (These People Must Pay, 2:26:10–2:28:00; @DrJackKruse, June 2, 2025, via @AlfidioValera). Specifically:

- Pawns in the Transfer Agreement: Lansky believed the Rothschilds, as banking elites, orchestrated the Transfer Agreement to profit from Jewish suffering while advancing Zionist goals. By collaborating with Nazis to move Jewish wealth to Palestine, they used persecuted Jews as shields to justify colonization, per Kruse’s narrative of elite manipulation.
    
- Sacrificing Jewish Lives: Kruse suggests Lansky viewed the Rothschilds and Rockefellers as complicit in delaying Jewish rescue during the Holocaust, prioritizing geopolitical leverage (e.g., Israel’s creation) over saving lives. Their financial control, per Silbert’s lesson, allowed them to exploit Jewish refugees as pawns in WWII’s chaos, orchestrated by the Fabians and [[Council of Foreign Relations|Council on Foreign Relations]] (CFR).
    
- Personal Betrayal: As a Jewish immigrant who rose from poverty, Lansky identified with common Jews, resenting elite Jewish bankers like the Rothschilds for abandoning their kin. Kruse claims Lansky’s mafia funding of Zionist militias (e.g., Irgun) was his attempt to protect Jews, contrasting with the Rothschilds’ self-serving agenda.
    
- Banking Hypocrisy: Lansky’s defiance of big bankers stemmed from their reliance on debt and control, which he saw as enslaving Jews and others. His decentralized empire, Kruse argues, was a direct rebuke to their exploitation, inspiring Bitcoin as a modern resistance tool.

## Broader Narrative

Lansky is a dual figure in Kruse’s story: a Zionist collaborator funding Israel’s rise through the Transfer Agreement and Manhattan Project, and a rebel against Rothschild and [[Rockefeller]] elites, whose WWII manipulation of Jewish people fueled his resentment. His financial maneuvers shaped U.S. dominance, Zionist leverage, and modern finance, with Bitcoin as his legacy against centralized control. Silbert’s money-power lesson underscores Lansky’s ability to wield influence by controlling his own financial networks, challenging elite dominance.
