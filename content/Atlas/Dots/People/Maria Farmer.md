Maria Farmer is a key figure in the [[Jeffrey Epstein]] case, recognized as one of the earliest whistleblowers to report his crimes. A painter and artist, Farmer met [[Jeffrey Epstein|Epstein]] in 1995 while working on an art project in New York City. She was employed by Epstein to work at his Manhattan townhouse, owned by [[Leslie Wexner]], and later at Wexner’s Ohio estate. In 1996, Farmer alleges she and her younger sister, Annie, were sexually assaulted by Epstein and [[Ghislaine Maxwell]] at the Ohio property. Farmer reported the assault to the FBI in 1996, providing one of the earliest documented complaints against Epstein, but claims the agency took no action.

She continued to speak out, notably in a 2002 affidavit for a lawsuit filed by [[Virginia Giuffre]], another Epstein victim, detailing Epstein’s predatory behavior and use of his properties for trafficking. Farmer’s allegations include witnessing Epstein’s manipulation of young women, often under the guise of modeling or art opportunities, and she implicated Wexner’s security staff in enabling the abuse. Her 2019 interviews, including with The New York Times and [[Whitney Webb]] for MintPress News, helped expose the breadth of Epstein’s network, including ties to powerful figures like Wexner and potential intelligence connections. Farmer’s persistence, despite facing harassment and intimidation, made her a pivotal voice in bringing Epstein’s crimes to light, though she has expressed frustration with the lack of accountability for enablers like Wexner.
