[[Dr. Jack Kruse|Kruse]] discusses Dr. Mary Sherman, a cancer researcher at Tulane University, as a key figure in the SV40 experiments. Key points include:

- Role in SV40 Research: [[Jack Kruse, MD|Kruse]] claims Sherman worked under Ochsner’s direction in a clandestine laboratory in New Orleans, using a linear accelerator to mutate SV40. He cites Edward Haslam’s Dr. Mary’s Monkey, which suggests Sherman’s research aimed to develop a vaccine to counter SV40’s cancer-causing effects but was secretly focused on creating a bioweapon. Kruse speculates that Sherman’s work involved irradiating SV40 to produce a virulent strain, potentially linked to AIDS or other diseases.
- Death and Cover-Up: Sherman was murdered on July 21, 1964, though Kruse, following Haslam, suggests her death may have been an accidental electrocution from the linear accelerator, covered up to conceal the project. He ties this to a broader conspiracy involving the CIA, Lee Harvey Oswald (allegedly a courier for the bioweapon), and the JFK assassination, suggesting Sherman’s death was linked to efforts to suppress knowledge of the experiments.
- Connection to Narrative: Kruse portrays Sherman as a tragic figure caught in a web of elite-driven medical and political agendas. Her work on SV40, he argues, reflects how scientific research can be manipulated for harmful purposes, a theme he extends to modern vaccine and surveillance technologies.
