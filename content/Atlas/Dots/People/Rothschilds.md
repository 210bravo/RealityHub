## Rothschild Infiltration of British Bank and Crown

In the Spotify podcast episode (what is money), [[Dr. Jack Kruse]] discusses his perspective on the Rothschild family’s influence over the British Crown, particularly around 1812, framing it within a broader narrative of financial and political control. Below is a summary of his claims based on the episode:

[[Jack Kruse, MD|Kruse]] asserts that the Rothschilds, a prominent banking dynasty, gained significant control over the British financial system following the Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815). He specifically points to the period around 1812, during which the Rothschilds allegedly capitalized on their financial prowess to dominate European banking. According to Kruse, their influence extended to the British Crown through strategic lending and control over money supply. He claims that Nathan Mayer Rothschild, a key figure in the family’s London branch, orchestrated a takeover of financial power by leveraging the economic turmoil of the era, particularly Britain’s need to fund its war efforts against Napoleon.

Kruse suggests that the Rothschilds’ control was cemented through their role in managing government bonds and war financing, which gave them unprecedented influence over the Bank of England. He argues this financial dominance effectively placed the Crown under their sway, as the monarchy and government became dependent on Rothschild loans. He ties this to a broader narrative of centralized banking power, claiming the Rothschilds manipulated markets and political systems to establish a form of economic sovereignty that rivaled or surpassed that of the Crown.

Additionally, Kruse frames this as part of a larger conspiracy where the Rothschilds used their wealth to influence global events, including wars and revolutions, to maintain their grip on power. He emphasizes their alleged control over gold and currency markets, which he claims allowed them to dictate terms to governments, including Britain’s.
