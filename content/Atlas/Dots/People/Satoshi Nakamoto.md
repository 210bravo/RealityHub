# Why Dr. [[Jack Kruse, MD|Jack Kruse]] Believes Len Sassaman is Satoshi Nakamoto

## Overview of Kruse’s Belief

In the podcast (2:24:50–2:28:00), Kruse asserts that Len Sassaman (1980–2011), an American cryptographer and cypherpunk, is the most likely candidate for Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin. Kruse argues that Sassaman’s technical expertise, ideological alignment with decentralization, and personal circumstances—particularly his 2011 suicide coinciding with Satoshi’s disappearance—make him the prime candidate. Kruse ties Sassaman’s work to [[Meyer Lansky]]’s legacy, suggesting that Lansky’s decentralized financial networks (1920s–1980s) inspired Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer framework, which Sassaman technically realized. Kruse frames this as a rebellion against centralized banking elites (e.g., [[Rothschilds]], Rockefellers), aligning with Silbert’s money-power lesson.

## Detailed Reasons for Kruse’s Belief

1. Technical Expertise and Cypherpunk Credentials:
    
    - Podcast Claims: Kruse highlights Sassaman’s mastery of public-key cryptography, peer-to-peer networks, and privacy-enhancing technologies (2:25:30). Sassaman worked on [[Pretty Good Privacy]] (PGP) encryption with pioneers like Hal Finney (a Bitcoin early adopter) and developed Mixmaster, an anonymous remailer system, both of which share principles with Bitcoin’s blockchain (e.g., decentralization, anonymity). Kruse argues Sassaman’s role at the [[Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography]] (COSIC) group in Belgium provided the infrastructure to develop Bitcoin’s code (2008–2009).
        
    - Context: Kruse connects Sassaman’s skills to Lansky’s use of “advanced computing” for untraceable financial networks (June 6, 2025, X post). Sassaman’s cryptographic work is seen as a modern extension of Lansky’s vision to bypass centralized banking control.
        
    - Supporting Evidence: Sassaman’s contributions to open-source projects like GNU Privacy Guard and his cypherpunk mailing list activity (where Bitcoin was announced) align with Satoshi’s technical profile.

2. Ideological Alignment with Decentralization:
    
    - Podcast Claims: Kruse emphasizes Sassaman’s cypherpunk ideology, which advocated privacy, freedom from authority, and decentralized systems (2:26:00). He argues Sassaman, like Lansky, sought to challenge centralized banking elites who used money to manipulate geopolitics (e.g., WWII, Zionism). Bitcoin’s fixed 21-million-coin supply and peer-to-peer design reflect Sassaman’s commitment to resisting elite control, per Kruse.
        
    - Context: Kruse ties this to Lansky’s resentment of Rothschilds and Rockefellers for exploiting Jews during WWII. Sassaman’s creation of Bitcoin is framed as a continuation of Lansky’s anti-elite rebellion, aligning with Silbert’s lesson that controlling money issuance grants world-shaping power.
        
    - Supporting Evidence: Sassaman’s open-source activism contrasts with predecessors like David Chaum, who patented digital cash, mirroring Lansky’s defiance of centralized systems.
        
3. Timing of Disappearance and Death:
    
    - Podcast Claims: Kruse points to the “eerie coincidence” of Sassaman’s suicide in July 2011, two months after Satoshi’s final email in April 2011 (“I’ve moved on to other things,” 2:27:00). He speculates Sassaman, struggling with depression, may have created Bitcoin as a final act of rebellion before exiting to protect its decentralization. Kruse suggests Sassaman’s death ensured Bitcoin remained leaderless, thwarting elite co-optation.
        
    - Context: Kruse compares this to Lansky’s low-profile later years, evading FBI scrutiny (e.g., hiding $3 million, 2:25:00). Both figures, in Kruse’s view, used strategic withdrawal to safeguard their legacies against centralized authority.
        
    - Supporting Evidence: Satoshi’s untouched 1.1 million BTC stash, worth billions, supports Kruse’s view that Sassaman prioritized ideology over personal gain, like Lansky’s defiance of bankers.
        
4. European Context and Writing Style:
    
    - Podcast Claims: Kruse notes Sassaman’s residence in Belgium (2006–2011) during Bitcoin’s development, where stable power grids supported uninterrupted mining (2:27:30). He cites Satoshi’s British English usage (e.g., “maths,” “bloody difficult”) and a UK newspaper headline in Bitcoin’s genesis block (The Times, 2009), suggesting Sassaman adopted a British persona to obscure his identity.
        
    - Supporting Evidence: Sassaman’s work at COSIC in Leuven, near a 1999 conference referenced in Satoshi’s writings, adds circumstantial plausibility, though not definitive proof.
        

## Why Lansky’s Role Matters

Kruse positions Lansky as Bitcoin’s conceptual architect, whose decentralized empire (1920s–1980s) defied [[Rothschilds]] and Rockefellers, who exploited Jews during WWII via the [[1933 Transfer Agreement|Transfer Agreement]] and Holocaust delays (2:26:10). Lansky’s resentment fuels Kruse’s narrative that Sassaman, as Satoshi, continued this rebellion by creating Bitcoin to dismantle centralized banking. Silbert’s lesson underscores both figures’ ability to wield power by controlling money issuance, with Lansky’s mafia and Sassaman’s Bitcoin challenging elite dominance.

## Counterarguments and Context

- Skepticism: Kruse acknowledges Sassaman’s widow, Meredith Patterson, denies he was Satoshi (2:27:45), but he argues her perspective may be limited or protective. He dismisses other candidates like Hal Finney, Nick Szabo, or Jack Dorsey, citing weaker ideological or technical fits.
    
- Speculative Nature: Kruse’s belief relies on circumstantial evidence (timing, skills, ideology) rather than definitive proof, fitting his conspiratorial lens of elite manipulation and hidden truths.
    

## Timeline of Kruse’s Narrative

- 1932–1939: Lansky funds Zionist causes via the Transfer Agreement, influencing [[Edward VIII]]’s 1936 abdication (April 19, 2025, X post).
    
- 1942–1945: Lansky funnels money to [[General Leslie Groves]] for the Manhattan Project, with [[Howard Hughes]] laundering funds (2:22:30–2:24:00).
    
- 1940s–1970s: Hoover’s accountants fail to find $3 million hidden by Lansky’s offshore networks (2:25:00–2:26:30).
    
- 1980–2011: Len Sassaman, inspired by Lansky’s decentralized model, develops cryptographic expertise in the cypherpunk community.
    
- 2006–2009: Sassaman, in Belgium, creates Bitcoin as Satoshi Nakamoto, embedding Lansky’s anti-elite vision (2:24:50–2:27:30).
