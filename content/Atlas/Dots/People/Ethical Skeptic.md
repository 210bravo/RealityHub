**The Ethical Skeptic** is a pseudonymous writer, former high-level U.S. naval intelligence officer, and professional strategist who promotes a rigorous, ethical approach to science and skepticism. He emphasizes **epistemological humility (epoch√©)** and critiques the misuse of skepticism as a tool for institutional or ideological control.

He holds degrees in **engineering, business, finance, and ethics**, and has led one of the top global strategy firms, working across fields like **pharmaceuticals, agriculture, national security, trade, and energy**. His work has impacted major corporations, world governments, and humanitarian causes.

He identifies as an **evolutionist and ignostic atheist**, supports science but opposes its **corruption by syndicates and profit-driven agendas**. He rejects both mainstream scientism and fringe dogmatism, advocating for disciplined inquiry and **anonymity** to focus on ideas, not persona or celebrity.

In 2024, he was selected to help shape the **U.S. Space Strategy** for the next 150 years. He also quietly funds **fringe research** into human origins and anomalous phenomena, insisting on **intellectual integrity**, **ethical skepticism**, and the **pursuit of knowledge to alleviate suffering**.
