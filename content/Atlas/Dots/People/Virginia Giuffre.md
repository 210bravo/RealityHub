Virginia Giuffre is one of the most prominent survivors and whistleblowers in the [[Jeffrey Epstein]] case, known for her lawsuits and public statements exposing his sex trafficking network. Born Virginia Roberts in 1983, she was recruited by Epstein and [[Ghislaine Maxwell]] in 2000 at age 16 while working as a spa attendant at[[Donald Trump]]’s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida. Giuffre alleges she was groomed and trafficked by Epstein, enduring sexual abuse from 2000 to 2002 at his properties in New York, Palm Beach, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. She claims she was paid to perform sexual acts for Epstein and his high-profile associates, including being sent to London to meet [[Prince Andrew]], Duke of York, in 2001, where she alleges abuse occurred.

Giuffre’s legal actions were pivotal. In 2009, she filed a lawsuit against Epstein, settled out of court, and in 2015, she sued Maxwell for defamation after Maxwell called her a liar, resulting in a 2017 settlement. Her 2019 lawsuit against Prince Andrew, filed in New York, detailed allegations of sexual abuse and was settled in 2022 for an undisclosed sum. Giuffre’s testimony, including depositions and interviews with outlets like The Miami Herald and in the Netflix docuseries Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich, exposed Epstein’s operations, naming powerful figures like [[Leslie Wexner]] and others in his orbit. She also provided evidence, such as a 2001 photo with Prince Andrew and Maxwell, corroborating her claims. Whitney Webb’s reporting in MintPress News cites Giuffre’s accounts to highlight Epstein’s intelligence ties, while Ryan Dawson references her lawsuits to underscore the network’s scope. Giuffre’s advocacy through her organization, Victims Refuse Silence, continues to support trafficking survivors, cementing her role as a key figure in seeking justice against Epstein and his enablers.
