Alexandre Benalla is a former security officer and deputy chief of staff to French President Emmanuel Macron, whose actions have thrust him into the center of significant political scandals. Born on September 8, 1991, in Évreux, France, Benalla began his career as a Socialist Party activist and bodyguard, working with figures like Martine Aubry and François Hollande before joining Macron’s security team during the 2017 presidential campaign. His rapid rise, despite a brief dismissal for a car accident while protecting Hollande, saw him become a key figure in Macron’s inner circle, earning the nickname "Rambo" for his assertive demeanor.

The primary scandal, known as the Benalla Affair, erupted in July 2018 when Le Monde published footage showing Benalla beating a young protester during the May Day demonstrations in Paris. Dressed in a police helmet and armband, despite lacking authorization, he assaulted the individual, an act captured on video by a La France Insoumise activist. Initially, the Élysée Palace suspended him for two weeks and failed to report the incident to prosecutors, prompting accusations of a cover-up. Public outrage led to his dismissal on July 20, 2018, and a formal investigation on July 22 for charges including violence, usurpation of police functions, and misuse of surveillance images. The affair deepened with revelations of Benalla’s perks—diplomatic passports, a €10,000 monthly salary, and an upscale Paris apartment—fueling perceptions of elite impunity. Subsequent probes uncovered his post-dismissal security consulting, including alleged ties to a Russian magnate, and in 2021, he received a suspended three-year sentence for the assault, avoiding jail time.

A more speculative hypothesis ties Benalla to André-Louis Auzière, Brigitte Macron’s first husband, who died in December 2019. This theory, circulating in alternative narratives like Candace Owens’ Becoming Brigitte series, suggests Benalla may have been employed to guard Auzière in a psychiatric ward, implying a cover-up of Auzière’s condition or death. This stems from a 2022 Paris Match article claiming Auzière ended his life in a clinic under surveillance, with Benalla allegedly involved, a claim Tiphaine Auzière, his daughter, denied, asserting her father was not institutionalized.
