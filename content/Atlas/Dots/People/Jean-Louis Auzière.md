Jean-Louis is the first cousin of André-Louis Auzière, Brigitte’s documented first husband, who died in December 2019. In the series, Jean-Louis emerges as a key witness after suing journalist Natasha Ray for defamation in 2019-2020, following her mistaken identification of him as André-Louis in a wedding photo. He claimed the Élysée Palace manipulated him into the lawsuit, only to abandon it, leaving him resentful. Jean-Louis provided Owens with details of André-Louis’s rushed, Élysée-orchestrated funeral, noting Brigitte and Macron’s absence and discrepancies in Tiphaine Auzière’s burial account. This fuels Owens’ narrative of a family cover-up, positioning Jean-Louis as an unwilling pawn in the identity mystery surrounding the Macron-Trogneux lineage.
