The Ethical Skeptic, referred to as "TES" or "Tes," is an anonymous individual with a background in systems engineering, data analytics, and strategic operations. They hold graduate and undergraduate degrees in engineering, business, finance, and ethics from top-ranked U.S. universities, with their ethics thesis earning an unprecedented A+++ from their dean. TES has served as a U.S. Naval Intelligence Officer, flag aide to a warfare theater commander, and has led a globally recognized strategy and operations firm, contributing to projects in medical, pharmaceutical, trade, energy, and famine strategies. Currently, they focus on market strategy for agriculture and energy businesses and support research into humanity’s origins and enigmatic phenomena, rejecting institutional deceit and cultivated ignorance. Their work emphasizes ethical skepticism, a pro-science approach that challenges pseudo-skepticism and prioritizes intellectual integrity over titles or credentials.

Topics Discussed: The Ethical Skeptic’s content spans their website and X posts, focusing on challenging mainstream narratives through data-driven analysis and first-principles reasoning. Key topics include:

1. Ethical Skepticism: TES advocates for a philosophy that combines scientific rigor with critical thinking, rejecting pseudo-skepticism (e.g., agenda-driven denial by media or activists) and emphasizing adherence to the scientific method and deontological ethics. They critique systems that enforce compliance or manipulate data to serve power structures.

2. Pandemic and Vaccine Analysis: TES extensively analyzes COVID-19 data, arguing that excess mortality during and post-pandemic (e.g., 799,010 non-COVID natural cause deaths, 168,300 non-natural deaths) stems largely from vaccine-related issues, malpractice, and denial of treatment rather than the virus alone. They highlight statistical manipulations (e.g., quashed-y charts, age-standardized analysis) used to obscure truths and assert that “Long COVID” is often misattributed post-vaccination syndrome.

3. Climate and Geophysical Theories: TES proposes the Exothermic Core-Mantle Decoupling - Dzhanibekov Oscillation (ECDO) Theory, suggesting that Earth’s core is sloughing high-energy nickel-iron, weakening the geomagnetic field and heating oceans, contributing to climate changes beyond anthropogenic CO2. They critique linear CO2 models as insufficient.

4. Consciousness and Enigmatic Phenomena: TES explores unconventional topics like consciousness, suggesting it may involve quantum or biophotonic processes, and investigates humanity’s cryptic origins, including potential extraterrestrial influences (e.g., Khufu Pyramid as instrumentation). They challenge dismissal of such topics as “fringe.”

5. Social and Psychological Phenomena: They discuss mass formation delusion, where populations adopt simplistic narratives, suspending critical thinking, and critique systems that extract “loosh” (emotional turmoil) through manufactured guilt or blame, such as in religious or political frameworks.

6. Data Integrity and Narrative Control: TES emphasizes the importance of deductive evidence over statistical p-values and critiques media-driven “sciencey” narratives that suppress sound reasoning. They highlight issues like election interference, vaccine hesitancy, and climate change dogmas as examples of narrative control.

7. Human Nutrition and Health: Their work in agriculture includes a focus on human nutrition, criticizing glyphosate/GMO cartels and fad diet industries for health impacts, linking these to systemic issues in modern healthcare.
