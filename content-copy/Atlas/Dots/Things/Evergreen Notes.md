## WhyÂ 

[Compound knowledge with conceptual notes](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/Compound+knowledge+with+conceptual+notes)

[Notes allow for multi-layer time travel](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/Notes+allow+for+multi-layer+time+travel)

Allows forÂ [Bottom-Up Thinking](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/Bottom-Up+Thinking), letting new ideas emerge from our curiosities.

## WhatÂ 

Evergreen areÂ [Conceptual notes](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/Conceptual+notes)Â consist ofÂ [atomic-sized, independent ideas](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/Conceptual+notes)Â that are thenÂ [connected with related ideas](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/Making+connections+between+notes).

As the name evergreen suggests, they are continually revisited and refined as we come across more information in the resources we consume.

They can come inÂ [various forms](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/USV/Types+of+notes#Knowledge-Based%20Notes)Â to act as building blocks for the overall structure of our thought navigation.

They are a type of idea-based note, which you can learn more about inÂ [Note types](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/Note%20types)

## HowÂ 

Notes with a specific status can be seen inÂ [My Greenhouse](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/My+Greenhouse/My+Greenhouse).

### CreationÂ 

I usually just use the quick switcher and type the name of the note, then pressÂ `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter`Â to create it.

Then I setÂ `Links`Â to a higher-order note, and startÂ [Note-making](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/My+Resources/My+MOCs/Note-making)Â ðŸ˜Ž

For other notes inÂ [USV Glossary](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/USV+Glossary), you will need to useÂ [QuickAdd Plugin](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/USV/QuickAdd+Plugin)Â to create them.

### MetadataÂ 

#### StatusÂ 

##### SeedlingsÂ 

ðŸŒ±

- For ideas that you just want to record, then grow later
- I just create the note title, and then set the status to ðŸŒ±
- This is what I would consider to beÂ [Fleeting Notes](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/USV/Fleeting+Notes)
- Once you start growing the idea, itÂ [Sprouts](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/USV/Evergreen+Notes#Sprouts)

##### SproutsÂ 

ðŸŒ¿

- Sprouting ideas that you are still in the process of growing and nurturing
    - Can range from a few jot notes to an overall structure, but the thing is, you still feel like they are not ready to be part of the rest of theÂ [Trees](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/USV/Evergreen+Notes#Trees). They need a bit more nurturing, whether it be byÂ [Making connections between notes](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/Making+connections+between+notes)Â or doing moreÂ [Research](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/My+Resources/My+MOCs/Research)
    - With sprouts, there is no rigid method for developing them as it is based on what you intuitively want to grow the note into, but if you want a more structured place to think, you can considerÂ [Brainstorms](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/Brainstorms)

##### TreesÂ 

ðŸŒ²

- Trees are notes mature enough to be part of your forest:
    - Already has connections with related notes
    - Contents of the note satisfy the title
- These are evergreen, meaning they continue to grow as you find more insights fromÂ [Content consumption](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/Content+consumption)Â or form more connections
- I personally don't follow this though. Instead I'm playing around with using it to mostly highlight the unique evergreen ideas in my vault

Understand the different statuses whenÂ [Managing and growing evergreen notes](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/Managing+and+growing+evergreen+notes)Â in the vault.

### MaintenanceÂ 

Still in elaboration, emerged fromÂ [WOW Workflow Session 3](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/My+Inputs/WOW+Workflow+Session+3)

- InÂ [Ideaverse Pro](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/My+Private+Notes/Ideaverse+Pro)Â I do kind of enjoy the different tags you can use to classify the different types of note statuses for further development in the vault
- Having a general maintenance view also seems helpful, right now mine is justÂ [My Greenhouse](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/My+Greenhouse/My+Greenhouse)
- Because right now unlike his my fleeting notes are all in greenhouse, but in reality they might still need to be developed to be part of my ideaverse? Otherwise I'll just have a lot of half-baked ideas? And having that digital holding space for all my temporary notes can help me be more mindful on how much shallow notes I do have?
- So right now it looks like this:
    - Develop
        - This is seedling
    - Connect
        - This is sprout
    - Refactor
        - I would consider to be the same as tidying a note, just cleaning up the contents by improving structure and content
        - No need for me to refactor notes most of the time? The ones I do need to refactor are ones in progress based on kanban boards? Could I have a universal one then? That's just called in progress Note-making station?
- Why is this useful? These always were possible, but since these different actions you can do to your notes are more explicit so you feel more control and awareness?
