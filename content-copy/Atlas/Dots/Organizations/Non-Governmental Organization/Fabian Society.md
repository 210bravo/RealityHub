## Short Overview

The Fabian Society is a British socialist organization founded in 1884, advocating gradualist and reformist approaches to socialism rather than revolutionary methods. It has influenced the UK’s Labour Party and global social democratic policies, often cited in conspiracy theories as a covert force pushing for a socialist world government. Critics point to its intellectual influence, while supporters view it as a think tank for progressive policy.[](https://x.com/JMGreerWriter/status/1879770712338268266)[](https://x.com/VoWSilla/status/1929253815926292952)

## Historical Timeline of the Fabian Society According to [[Dr. Jack Kruse]]’s Theories

### 1884: Founding of the Fabian Society

- [[Jack Kruse, MD|Kruse]]’s Theory: The Fabian Society was established in London in 1884 as a deliberate, elitist organization with the goal of imposing socialism through gradual, insidious means, contrasting with Marxist revolutionary approaches. Kruse claims the Fabians were a “think tank” designed by wealthy intellectuals to control societies via financialization and centralized power, setting the stage for global manipulation.
    
- Key People: Kruse highlights early Fabians like Sidney Webb, Beatrice Webb, George Bernard Shaw, and Annie Besant as architects of a covert agenda. He suggests their intellectualism masked a desire to create a “political leviathan” that would dominate through policy and ideology.
    
- Activities: Kruse points to the Fabians’ first tract, Why Are the Many Poor? (1884), and Fabian Essays in Socialism (1889) as propaganda tools to promote socialism while hiding their true aim: consolidating power for elites. He claims their “big tent” approach, avoiding Marxist purges, allowed them to infiltrate diverse political circles, including the British Labour Party.

### 1890s–1910s: Early Influence and Global Expansion

- Kruse’s Theory: The Fabians began embedding their ideology into British and global institutions, using their intellectual influence to shape education, economics, and governance. Kruse alleges they laid the groundwork for centralized banking systems, which he ties to financial control mechanisms like the Federal Reserve (established 1913).
    
- Key People: Kruse mentions Fabian intellectuals like H.G. Wells, who he claims promoted eugenics and population control as part of a broader elitist agenda. He also links early Fabians to the Rhodes-Milner Round Table groups, suggesting a network of Anglo-American elites.
    
- Activities: Kruse asserts the Fabians influenced the British Labour Party’s formation, using it as a vehicle to push socialist policies that secretly served elite interests. He claims their gradualist strategy (“Fabian socialism”) was a blueprint for manipulating public policy without overt revolution, citing their role in education reforms and social welfare programs as tools for control.

### 1910s–1940s: World Wars and the Creation of Israel

- Kruse’s Theory: Kruse alleges the Fabians orchestrated major geopolitical events, including World Wars I and II, to destabilize nations and consolidate power. He claims they “gave life to Israel” as a strategic move to control the Middle East, tying this to their alleged influence over British foreign policy and the [[Balfour Declaration]] (1917).
    
- Key People: Kruse points to Fabian connections with figures like John Foster Dulles and Allen Dulles, whom he claims were linked to the Fabians through the [[Council of Foreign Relations|Council on Foreign Relations]] (CFR), a supposed Fabian offshoot. He suggests the Dulles brothers, as key U.S. figures in diplomacy and intelligence, advanced Fabian goals post-[[WWII]].
    
- Activities: Kruse claims the Fabians used the chaos of the world wars to push for globalist institutions like the League of Nations and later the United Nations, which he sees as tools for centralized control. He alleges their influence over [[Zionism]] and the creation of Israel was part of a plan to secure geopolitical leverage, though he provides no direct evidence.
    

### 1930s–1940s: Alleged Creation of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]

- Kruse’s Theory: In a November 26, 2024, X post, Kruse claims “[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] was a creation of the Fabians,” suggesting they engineered the rise of Nazi Germany to further their globalist agenda. He posits that the Fabians, as a think tank, manipulated financial and political systems to create authoritarian regimes, using Hitler as a pawn to destabilize Europe and justify post-war restructuring.
    
- Key People: Kruse doesn’t name specific Fabians tied to Hitler but implies their influence through financial elites and banking networks, possibly referencing Rothschild or [[Rockefeller]] connections, common in conspiracy narratives.
    
- Activities: Kruse suggests the Fabians funded or indirectly supported [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]’s rise through economic policies or banking channels, though details are vague. He ties this to their alleged role in shaping the Labour Party, which he claims was complicit in broader elitist schemes during this period.
    

### 1950s–1960s: Post-War Consolidation and CIA Connections

- Kruse’s Theory: Kruse alleges the Fabians, via the CFR, influenced U.S. foreign policy and intelligence operations, particularly through the CIA. He connects this to the Kennedy assassinations, claiming the Fabians and CFR orchestrated JFK’s death (1963) due to his threat to dismantle the CIA, as noted in his podcast with [[Robert F Kennedy Jr|RFK Jr]]. and Rick Rubin.
    
- Key People: Kruse highlights Allen Dulles (CIA Director, 1953–1961) and John Foster Dulles (Secretary of State, 1953–1959) as Fabian-aligned figures who shaped U.S. policy. He also mentions [[Calley Means]], a modern health policy figure, as a CFR member continuing Fabian agendas in healthcare.
    
- Activities: Kruse claims the Fabians used the CIA to suppress dissent and advance globalist policies, including the Bay of Pigs fiasco (1961), which he ties to JFK’s mistrust of Dulles. He alleges the Fabians influenced health policy through centralized medicine, connecting this to vaccine development and chronic disease proliferation.
    

### 1970s–1990s: Labour Party and Global Financialization

- Kruse’s Theory: Kruse asserts the Fabians solidified their grip on the British Labour Party, culminating in Tony Blair’s leadership (1997–2007). He claims Blair and later Keir Starmer were Fabian puppets who implemented policies to financialize society, increasing elite control over economies and individuals.
    
- Key People: Kruse names Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, and Keir Starmer as Fabian-aligned Labour leaders. He suggests they worked with global financial elites to entrench centralized banking and debt-based economies.
    
- Activities: Kruse points to Labour’s policies under Blair (e.g., NHS reforms, tax policies) as Fabian-driven efforts to expand government control while enriching elites. He ties this to the Fabians’ alleged role in creating the European Union as a supranational control mechanism.
    

### 2000s–Present: Modern Influence and Health Conspiracies

- Kruse’s Theory: Kruse claims the Fabians’ modern influence extends to health, technology, and geopolitics. He alleges they promote centralized medicine to perpetuate chronic diseases, linking this to vaccine programs, ultra-processed foods, and electromagnetic radiation (e.g., [[5G]]). In a May 10, 2025, X post, he references a podcast discussing the Fabians’ role in the CFR and directed energy weapons, suggesting they control advanced technologies for surveillance and harm.
    
- Key People: Kruse mentions [[Calley Means]] as a CFR member pushing Fabian health agendas, possibly through pharmaceutical or food industry ties. He also connects [[Robert F Kennedy Jr|RFK Jr]].’s critiques (e.g., vaccine skepticism, medical-industrial complex) to Fabian schemes, as discussed in their podcast with Rick Rubin.
    
- Activities: Kruse alleges the Fabians influence:
    
    - Healthcare: Promoting vaccines and processed foods to create a “sickcare” system, as discussed in his What is Money? podcast with Robert Breedlove (January 3, 2025), where he critiques centralized medicine.
        
    - Technology: Developing directed energy weapons and [[5G]] for population control, per his X post.
        
    - Politics: Shaping Labour policies under Starmer and influencing U.S. health policy through figures like [[Robert F Kennedy Jr|RFK Jr]].’s adversaries in the medical-industrial complex.
        
    - Financialization: Using central banks and fiat currency to enslave populations, a theme echoed in Breedlove’s discussions with Kruse about [[Bitcoin]] as a countermeasure.
        

### Future Speculations

- Kruse’s Theory: Kruse predicts the Fabians will escalate their control through digital currencies, health surveillance, and geopolitical conflicts. He sees [[Bitcoin]], as discussed with Breedlove, as a potential disruptor to their financial dominance, aligning with Breedlove’s view of [[Bitcoin]] as “sovereign money.” Kruse also warns of increased use of directed energy weapons and health interventions to suppress dissent.
    
- Key People: Kruse suggests modern figures like Means and Starmer will continue Fabian agendas, while outsiders like [[Robert F Kennedy Jr|RFK Jr]]. and himself expose their plans.
    
- Activities: Kruse envisions Fabians pushing for global governance, possibly through climate policies or pandemics, to justify authoritarian measures.
    

### Key Themes in Kruse’s Theories

- Financialization: Kruse sees the Fabians as architects of debt-based economies, using central banks (e.g., Federal Reserve, Bank of England) to control populations, a theme echoed in Breedlove’s What is Money? discussions.
    
- Centralized Medicine: He alleges Fabians promote vaccines, processed foods, and EMF exposure to create chronic diseases, profiting elites while weakening societies.
    
- Geopolitical Manipulation: From [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] to Israel to the Kennedy assassinations, Kruse claims the Fabians engineer crises to justify control mechanisms.
    
- Elite Networks: He ties the Fabians to the CFR, CIA, and financial dynasties (e.g., Rothschilds), portraying them as a global cabal.
    
- Resistance: Kruse advocates for decentralized solutions (e.g., [[Bitcoin]], circadian health) to counter Fabian influence, aligning with Breedlove’s and [[Robert F Kennedy Jr|RFK Jr]].’s anti-establishment views.
