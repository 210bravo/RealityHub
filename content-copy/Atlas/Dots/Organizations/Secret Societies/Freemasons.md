# Freemasons

## Short Overview
Freemasonry, formalized in 1717 with the establishment of the United Grand Lodge of England, is a global fraternal organization promoting moral and personal development through rituals and symbolism. Often linked to conspiracy theories, it’s accused of influencing world events, from the French Revolution to modern politics, despite its public focus on charity and community service. Its secretive rituals fuel speculation.[](https://www.history.com/articles/secret-societies-freemasons-knights-templar)[](https://www4.acenet.edu/secret-societies-harvard)[](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Freemasonry-and-other-secret-societies-like-Skull-and-Bones-or-the-Bilderberg-Group)
