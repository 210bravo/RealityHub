# Summary of the Theory

Owens uses a mix of historical recounting, media analysis, and speculative connections to challenge the official narrative, supported by journalist Xavier Poussard and interspersed with sponsor promotions.

## Opening and Context

Owens opens by explaining the delay in the second episode, attributing it to DDoS attacks after announcing it on CandaceOwens.com, and a second legal letter from the Macrons, which she promises to show later. She interprets their actions as evidence of guilt, setting a confrontational tone against the Macrons’ attempts to suppress her investigation.

## Brigitte and Emmanuel’s Relationship Narrative

Owens recounts the official story: Emmanuel Macron, born in 1977, met Brigitte Trogneux, a 39-year-old married teacher with three children, when he was 14 during a school play at La Providence in Amiens. She claims Brigitte, allegedly swept away by his performance, divorced her husband André-Louis Auzière in 2006 to marry Macron in 2007. Owens labels this a "creepy" statutory rape scenario, given Macron’s age and Brigitte’s authority, contrasting it with the media’s romanticized portrayal. She ties this to Macron’s admiration for author André Gide, a confessed pederast, as hinted in his presidential portrait.

## Media Propaganda and Image Control

Owens alleges an intense propaganda campaign, detailed by Xavier Poussard in his forthcoming book, used television, radio, and glossy magazines to sell the Macrons’ love story. She cites 60 newspaper covers and 13 Paris Match features in 26 months as "oversaturation" to normalize the narrative. PR expert Mimi Marchand, dubbed the "Pope of celebrity press," controlled Brigitte’s image via Best Image agency, with billionaire Xavier Niel acting as an intermediary. Owens connects this to Bernard Arnault (LVMH CEO) and his daughter Delphine, who styled Brigitte, and Nicolas Ghesquière, LVMH’s transgender-fashion-promoting director, suggesting a coordinated elite effort.

## Jeremy Ladrée Scandal

A subplot involves Jeremy Ladrée, son of Brigitte’s friend Mark Ladrée, convicted thrice for child pornography (2008, 2015, 2024), with 4,000 images found in the latest case. Owens claims Mimi Marchand covered up the 2015 conviction, but this backfired, prompting the Macrons to distance themselves from her amid her own scandals, including a 2018 Closer magazine leak about Brigitte’s cosmetic surgery

## Cosmetic Surgery and Dr. Patrick Bui

Owens highlights a 2018 Closer report of Brigitte at the American Hospital for surgery, which she overreacted to compared to a prior Express report. She points to a clue—describing the surgeon as quoting Victor Hugo’s "woman’s flesh, ideal clay"—linking to Dr. Patrick Bui, a feminization surgery expert. Macron’s 2023 award of the Legion of Honor to Bui is presented as evidence supporting her transgender claim.

## Legal Threats and Evidence Challenges

Owens reads the Macrons’ legal letter, which avoids addressing her transgender allegation, instead nitpicking claims like photo colorization and implying Macron’s death. She counters with 21 yes/no questions (e.g., “Was Brigitte born a biological male?”), offered to fly to France for answers, but received no response. She frames this as a strategy to intimidate, not refute, her narrative.Isabella Ferrara’s DeathOwens mentions journalist Isabella Ferrara, found dead after investigating the Macrons, suggesting foul play despite official drowning reports, though she avoids direct accusation.Sponsorships and ConclusionPromotions for Good Ranchers (American meat) and audience engagement break the flow, emphasizing her independent platform. Owens concludes by vowing to expose the Macrons’ alleged lies, framing her work as protecting children from predatory behavior, and urging support at CandaceOwens.com.

## Overall Narrative

This episode deepens Owens’ conspiracy that Brigitte Macron is a transgender predator who groomed Macron, supported by a media cover-up involving elite figures like Marchand, Niel, and Arnault. Photo absences, Bui’s surgery link, and Ladrée’s scandal bolster her claims, while legal threats and Ferrara’s death hint at suppression. The narrative blends factual recounting with speculation, positioning Owens as a truth-seeker against a controlled French narrative, with a call to action for her audience.

# Full Text

00:00
all right guys so we delayed the second 
installment of the becoming Brigitte series   because after announcing that we were going 
to air the episode on our CandaceOwens.com  

00:09
website we underwent extensive DDOS attacks all 
weekend essentially our our servers were being  

00:15
overwhelmed then yesterday evening we received 
a second second strongly worded letter from the  

00:22
El Palace from Brigitte and Emmanuel Macron 
this time it's a very brief letter which we   are going to show you in its entirety later 
on in the show what can we say other than the  

00:31
macron's sure are not behaving like a couple 
who have absolutely nothing to hide so let's  

00:36
figure out why they are behaving the way that 
they are welcome back to our Becoming Brigitte Series so a lot of people were wondering with 
the first installment the entry to this series  

01:01
why are the French people allowing this to happen 
how could they allow all of these things to happen   and you're probably wondering how on Earth 
Brigitte and Emanuel Macron have pulled this  

01:10
off essentially this Mass suppression of the press 
so that none of us were even aware of all of this  

01:15
weird stuff happening in their country how is it 
that Emanuel Macron who was virtually unknown to  

01:21
the public a year before he came into Power 
managed to Scuttle the campaign of Francois   Fon the man who was a shoe-in essentially for for 
the presidency how did he do all of this well  

01:32
for English speakers it's a bit like the rise of 
Barack Obama sure yes Barack Obama was a Senator   and he therefore was involved in politics to some 
degree but his Ascension into the presidency did  

01:44
sort of in many ways come out of nowhere except 
Barack Obama was not married to someone who was  

01:49
more than two decades older than him you may 
know him Macron just to be very clear and I  

01:54
will state this again and again was just 14 
years old when he appeared in a school play  

02:00
at his school called La providance RIT at that 
time was a teacher at the same school who ran  

02:06
a Theater Workshop okay she was in fact 39 years 
old at this time and allegedly married with three  

02:14
children one of her children Lawrence was the 
same age and therefore in school with Emmanuel  

02:21
Macron okay so Story Goes that she saw him perform 
in a play and she was just swept away eventually  

02:29
unwilling to resist her feelings for the much 
younger Prince so much so that she eventually  

02:34
divorced her husband she broke up her family 
because of this of course this is objectively a  

02:40
very creepy story so how on Earth did they sell 
it to the French public that's where we need to  

02:45
begin here the answer of course as always is 
through a very intense propaganda campaign  

02:52
that is filled with lies and severe intentional 
misrepresentations as Xavier Poussard that is the  

02:58
journalist that broke this incredible story puts 
in in his forthcoming book he wrote this quote to  

03:03
sell this improbable story intense propaganda 
was deployed across all media television radio  

03:10
and the internet books praising Brigitte and Emanuel 
and glossy magazine covers saturated the public  

03:17
space the aim was to subliminally instill in 
the minds a storytelling designed by the cream  

03:24
of the Parisian Specialists of Public Image this 
pulpy narrative told the story of Emanuel Macron  

03:30
a precocious and virtuoso student at L LA 
providance in Aman the Press compared him  

03:36
to mozart who won over his teacher bit a 
dynamic beautiful and charismatic woman  

03:42
end quote so yeah they sold this as a story 
of triumph over Conformity right this aged  

03:49
defying love perhaps as we now know an early nod 
to the written works of macron's favorite author  

03:56
Andre GED who as we mentioned in a previous 
episode was a self-admitted pederast raped  

04:02
Muslim boys and he wrote about this openly and 
despite this he would wind up or at least his  

04:07
book would wind up um in Emanuel macron's first 
presidential portrait incredibly creepy on the  

04:15
14th of April 2016 when Paris match the magazine 
devoted its first cover to Brigitte the readers  

04:22
were told that one day in her heart everything 
secretly changes she attends Milan kera's play  

04:29
entitled jock a son Matra in which one of the 
ninth graders Emanuel macron is the hero he's  

04:36
already got his Eagle Eye they writ oh yes he's 
already got his Eagle Eye kind of honing in on  

04:43
Brigitte that's what we're told here's a by 
the way a little video of um Emanuel macron  

04:48
performing when he was younger uh in a play you 
can just take a look at this we can let this run

05:26
wonderful wonderful irresistible for an almost 
40-year-old woman uh who and had him join her  

05:32
Theater Workshop in the next school year now we 
should pause here to consider how terrifying it   is that the media as an entity has this kind of 
power to romanticize acts of sheer evil and then  

05:43
to Gaslight and Bully those who recognize it to 
be so those of us who say no there's something   very wrong with this picture anyways no less than 
60 newspaper covers were dedicated to Brigitte  

05:54
within a period of just 26 months Paris match 
alone thus far to date has dedicated 13 covers  

06:01
to Brigitte now I I would refer to that as sort of 
um a psychological strategy of oversaturation  

06:09
right if you give the public so much information 
whether it's true or false it becomes immediately  

06:15
implausible to the average person that there might 
be something hidden right because you're like well   there's so much information it becomes sort of 
the media bystander effect if so many people  

06:23
are covering the story then the the story must be 
covered it's already covered there's nothing left   for us to learn so I'm going to now tell you the 
official legend that was established about Brigitte  

06:33
Macron in these early days by the media it is as 
follows first and foremost they told the public  

06:39
that the age gap between them was that he was 
17 an outright lie uh and that that Brigitte at the  

06:47
time was 36 also an outright lie now let's go 
through the timeline of Brigitte's prior life which  

06:53
was asserted by this same media okay they tell 
us that in 1953 on April 13th 1953 ironically the  

07:02
same date uh that the MK Ultra program came into 
existence uh Brit trno made a name trno was born  

07:10
in Aman she was the youngest daughter of a family 
of confectioners who prospered in northern France  

07:18
then they tell us that after a strict Catholic 
Education with the Sacred Heart Sisters in 1974  

07:25
when she was 21 years old she married a man 
named Andre Louise o iier becoming then Brigitte  

07:31
oier married to a bank executive following in her 
husband's footsteps Brit oier began a career as a  

07:38
press officer at the Chamber of Commerce in Lil 
and then they went on to have three children one  

07:45
firstborn Sebastian in 1975 a son uh then they had 
Lawrence a daughter that's the one that was uh the  

07:52
same age as Emanuel Marron and attended school 
with him they had her allegedly in 1977 and then  

07:58
came t Tian you will come to recognize is really 
the only one of the children that speaks out and  

08:04
defends Brigitte Macron which is quite interesting they 
had her allegedly in 1984 and then The Story Goes  

08:12
that uh after becoming this press officer and 
working there in the at the Chamber of Commerce  

08:19
she decided to switch to teaching at some point in 
the mid1 1980s first in strawberg as a literature  

08:26
teacher at uh the Lucy B Protestant College then 
of course at La providance the Jesuit college  

08:35
back in her native Aman uh because her and Emanuel 
Macron are from the same place so in 1991 she went  

08:42
back there and of course while she was there she 
fell head over heels in love with the brilliant   student Emmanuel Macron now this entire story 
was being painted absent any pictures right and  

08:55
so as the Press was selling this they tried to get 
readers to imagine that Brigitte was just irresistibly  

09:03
sexy and hot right like she was this sort of 
1980s pinup doll just unbelievably like a Claudia  

09:11
shiffer type this is this was the image they were 
trying to paint in their head like she's older now   but oo if you had seen her when Emanuel macron 
saw her she was like a pinup a pinup and she was  

09:23
wearing short skirts they talked about how she she 
used to wear skirts and how all the boys were just  

09:28
drooling over her all these boys who happen to be 
going through puberty at the school fantasizing   about this hot Claudia shiffer type teacher um and 
of course the brilliant virtuoso Emanuel macron  

09:39
and her then began this sort of clandestine Affair 
years later in 2006 recognizing that she was  

09:48
hopelessly in love with Emanuel macron she made a 
huge decision to break up her family by divorcing  

09:54
her husband Andre Lis the banker and marrying her 
former student mcon just a year later in 2007 okay  

10:05
again that's the legend that was established 
by the media Now to control the public image of  

10:10
brigit the couple brought in well a woman known as 
Michelle marshan she goes by Mimi for short that's  

10:18
the woman I'm showing you right here on the left 
hand side walking next to brigit and she is known  

10:23
as the pope of celebrity press the popess of the 
celebrity press you do not cross Mimi I'm talking  

10:30
about this all week PR firms people that they're 
at the top she will break you down if she needs  

10:35
to you can see all sorts of Trials she's been 
involved in she has been accused of using tactics  

10:42
of blackmail and coercion we'll get into that in 
a little bit and her task was to essentially flood  

10:48
the public with these hyper selected photos of the 
wannabe presidential couple looking airbrushed and  

10:55
and fabulous you know just sell this idea that 
nothing weird happened in the past and so Mimi  

11:01
was able to enjoy essentially near exclusivity 
on Brigitte's image through her photo agency which  

11:07
is known as best image you will find as we get 
deeper in the series you yourself are going to   fall down this hole and you're going to start 
looking for photos and trying to verify things  

11:15
about Brigitte's past and you're going to see in the 
corner that a lot of these photos say best image  

11:21
yes that is Mimi maran's photo image business 
it means Mimi was in control of this image  

11:29
now as far as the conversations that were being 
had between Mimi and bit there was one person  

11:35
acting as an intermediary and that person's name 
is Xavier Neil he is a billionaire you should  

11:42
know one of the wealthiest men in France and uh 
I should mention that he is also the son-in-law  

11:49
of Bernard onno the CEO and the chairman of lvmh 
yes that lvmh Louis Vuitton moette and Hennessy  

11:59
in January of last year Bernard ano overtook Elon 
Musk to become the richest man in the world okay  

12:06
Bernard arno's children two of them were actually 
taught by Brit in school and you should know two  

12:15
of his children were taught by Brit in school 
later Brit developed a close relationship with   arno's eldest daughter who she didn't teach deline 
who would go on to become Brit's clothing provider  

12:26
through obviously Louis Vuitton's Artis director 
and stylist okay just to follow that Bernardo know  

12:33
has a daughter and she gets involved in styling um 
and addressing Brigitte Macron the first lady and she  

12:41
does this obviously through Louis Vuitton and 
Taps their artistic director to be the stylist  

12:47
that artistic director's name is Nicholas gesier 
now why am I telling you about that who cares what  

12:53
brijit is wearing well you should just know 
as another fun fact that this man is the main  

12:58
promoter of transgenderism and androgyny in the 
Fashion World he's huge okay not only um has he  

13:05
been according this is directly according to 
Out magazine deliberately hiring trans models  

13:12
and choosing them to open for Louis Vuitton's 
fashion show like when he picked a 23-year-old  

13:17
transgendered individual named Crow Kean to open 
for their 2018 show in which they premiered their  

13:25
spring summer collection um but gesier ALS also 
has taken it upon himself to launch the careers  

13:31
of a ton of transgender models all throughout the 
fashion industry like uh one person named Teddy  

13:37
Keen Leon was thanked uh Nicholas profusely 
who at the age of 23 became a household name  

13:44
after being discovered by Nicholas gasier um at 
the age of 21 he was discovered by the age of 23  

13:49
he was thanking him uh and so this is just the 
person that's dressing Brigitte I digress so what  

13:55
okay Brigitte's stylist specializes in transgenderism 
in the fashion World um as a creative director for  

14:01
lvmh coincidence you could say right fine okay 
the point here is also to demonstrate the kind  

14:08
of power that surrounds Brigitte because when we 
consider how it might be plausible for a story   this big to have been intentionally covered up 
by the mainstream media um yeah well it's kind of  

14:18
important to know who is the surrounding cast and 
how powerful these people could be uh the other  

14:23
point is that Xavier Neil going back to him that's 
Bernard Al no's son-in-law who was the go between  

14:29
between the wannabe presidential couple and Mimi 
Marsh our Pope press lady uh Xavier and Neil  

14:38
Xavier Neil and Mimi met through a shared lawyer 
because both of them have a bit of a checkered  

14:44
past okay Xavier in the 1980s helped develop uh a 
a chat service that was dedicated to cyber sex and  

14:53
it became incredibly lucrative for him and then he 
became part owner of a chain of peep shows and one  

14:59
of them was later found to be a front for a pro 
a prostitution ring and in 2004 he was arrested  

15:06
on charges of aggravated pimping I should be clear 
here that those charges were later dismissed but  

15:12
I do also here want to quote Xavier poussard book 
he says this a lot has been written about Xavier  

15:19
Neil the father of the free box and the twoo cell 
phone subscription plan essentially this is like  

15:27
um just to make it clear for English listeners 
it's almost like uh Verizon bundle this is this is  

15:32
how he became extraordinarily wealthy today he is 
a full member of the global hyper class connected  

15:38
to all the Silicon Valley big shots and propelled 
by Henry kravis to the board of directors of the  

15:44
powerful American Investment fund KKR however 
the role of its Storage St service DL free in  

15:52
hosting child pornography is still too little 
unknown and free has even been described by the  

15:59
Canadian Center for Child Protective Services as 
the largest source of child sexual abuse images  

16:08
okay now can go down that line you can look up 
what the uh Canadian child for child P protection  

16:15
project arachnid is and why they started going 
after this and that's connections to Xavier O'Neil  

16:21
but that's not what we're here to talk about I'm 
here to tell you about how he met Mimi marshan   through a shared lawyer because she was serving 
time MIM marshan after being accused of various  

16:31
things she had racked up a string of suspended 
prison sentences in the 1980s and spent 2 years  

16:36
behind bars awaiting trial over her involvement 
with her gangster boyfriend uh who is identified  

16:43
in her biography as hafed even though eventually 
she was not convicted and then eventually Xavier  

16:48
Neil gave her money to save best image in then in 
1998 she was handed another three-year suspended  

16:56
sentence over another former boyfriend and whole 
drug dealing operation and through that Xavier  

17:03
helped her out financially of course in 2024 when 
he saved her photo agency again best image and in  

17:08
turn in turn for him having saved best image or 
helped her out I am sure that she looks after the  

17:15
images of him and his associates in the public 
okay so just how Central was this woman Mimi in  

17:22
creating this image of Brigitte to the public okay 
this woman who was known to be a little bit of  

17:27
a gangster behind the scenes like I said you can 
look into her yourself Mimi Marsh in fact I think   the New York Times just did a takeown piece of 
her and all of her involvement well just over a  

17:37
year after mccrone was inaugurated the president 
of France Mimi had this picture of herself taken  

17:43
in the presidential office making a V for victory 
sign with her hands yeah because they were indeed  

17:51
victorious in having fooled the public about Brit 
that's what I would imagine that's all about but  

17:57
then something really interesting happened okay 
very interesting happened Brigitte and Emanuel shortly  

18:03
after that photo was taken made the decision to 
sort of carfully pull away from Mimi marshand  

18:10
their PR fixer woman because she was involved 
in another Scandal and you guys I'm telling you  

18:16
it just seems to be a lot of oopsies around this 
couple it's weird Okay so Mimi also shares another  

18:23
friend with Brigitte they have a mutual friend 
in a billionaire and that is named Mark ladri  

18:30
de larier okay Mark is so close to Brit to be very 
clear so close to Brigitte mccrone and he enjoys being  

18:38
photographed out with Brigitte macron so close that 
they decided to attend the production of a show  

18:43
together a show called star Mania you're going 
wow why do I remember Candace talking about star  

18:49
Mania on the last episode oh because that was the 
show that they attended together that was produced  

18:55
by Thomas Jolly where Brit then handpicked Thomas 
Jolly to do the Olympics so Mark lri was with her  

19:02
okay at that Premiere when they were like this is 
the right guy to throw on uh these Olympics which  

19:08
uh the or the Olympic show which had obviously 
transgendered individuals we had drag queens  

19:13
that were stting there was a lot going on that 
offends my Christian senses and I would call   it Satanic anyways you're probably wondering why 
Mimi's mutual friend with Brigitte caused a problem  

19:25
for the presidential couple in which suddenly 
they said we've got to back away away from Mimi  

19:30
well Mark that guy Mark ladri another billionaire 
happens to have a really troubled son named Jeremy  

19:37
and uh shortly after Mimi took that picture in the 
presidential office it was revealed that Mimi did  

19:43
her friend Mark a solid by keeping Jeremy's name 
and his face out of the press because she runs  

19:49
the Press like she's like a press gangster so to 
speak Jeremy his son uh was the former manager  

19:54
of a Children's Entertainment Company who was 
twice convicted once in 2008 and once in 2015  

20:02
and you're never going to guess what it was for 
child pornography cases and then again Beyond this  

20:08
time and recently 2004 and 24 um the mother of his 
children summoned police to their place in maresh  

20:16
out of fear after she went through his computer um 
and they have very young children the ages at that  

20:22
time were three in one I believe after discovering 
even more images on his computers investigators  

20:27
collected 4,000 images of children on his computer 
naked children that were being raped for that he  

20:36
has by the way gotten another slap on the wrist 
um what I was able to determine online and again  

20:42
obviously French is not my uh first language is 
that he's been sentenced to just eight months  

20:47
for that and that that sentence has been suspended 
meaning it won't happen until down the line that's  

20:53
the last I could find on it I'm happy to correct 
that if that information is wrong so that's three   child pornography convictions for Mark and Mimi 
helped cover up the one in 2015 and and so anyways  

21:04
covering up Jeremy's tracks and that conviction 
was a bad look for the newly presidential couple  

21:09
and so they began to pull away from her but 
Mimi is kind of one of these people like we were   talking about yesterday these PR agent that you 
just don't cross okay and she didn't like that she  

21:18
didn't like that people were starting to say that 
she was on the out that she was no longer allowed   into Elis Palace uh then a book was published in 
October 2018 called The Book of Mimi and it became  

21:31
even more clear that she was Persona n grada 
in the presidential Inner Circle and she was no  

21:38
longer invited to attend the Thursday meetings 
at the L and so what does a PR person do when  

21:43
they feel burned you know they drop a bomb in the 
press and it looks like she indeed Dropped a Bomb  

21:51
an explosion in the Press about Brit macron in 
the magazine called Closer okay Brigitte had somehow  

21:59
been spotted at the entrance to the American 
Hospital in Paris reportedly for undergoing  

22:07
cosmetic surgery under general anesthesia and the 
first lady was Furious about this publication okay  

22:13
she publicly condemned closer magazine for her 
favorite invasion of privacy okay understandable  

22:20
if you're at the hospital getting some work done 
her reaction though seemed like an overreaction  

22:27
especially to journalist Xavier poussard it just 
struck him as odd because a year earlier another  

22:33
magazine called the express had similarly outed 
her for under going under the knife with a doctor  

22:38
named Dr Sydney Ohana and yet she didn't care she 
didn't face any that doctor and the express did  

22:45
not face any public condemnation Brigitte was not mad 
at them so Xavier is going what particularly about  

22:51
this publication and closer made her freak out 
made her go so far as to set for the first time a  

22:57
precedent in the first lady came out and publicly 
condemned the Press so he began pouring over that  

23:05
article and closer trying to understand what did 
I miss what did I miss what's in here that set   her off and he found it you see while closer had 
not named the surgeon they didn't at all named the  

23:16
surgeon who worked on Brigitte they did this sort of 
petty thing where they left a massive undeniable  

23:21
clue as to who the surgeon was in the magazine 
they described the surgeon as a quote eminent and  

23:28
Medi Savvy plastic surgeon who would keenly quote 
Victor Hugo his favorite expression woman's flesh  

23:36
ideal clay well there was only one surgeon who 
had been featured in The Press with that quotation  

23:43
just a year earlier in Paris match and his name 
was Dr Patrick Bui he's a plastic surgeon at the  

23:50
American Hospital in Paris who in that Paris match 
feature which was entitled operation young again  

23:56
uh replied to a question that he was asked and he 
said woman's flesh ideal clay now why was this a  

24:04
bombshell enclosure or rather a a a threat that 
was made a shot that was fired if you will to Brigitte  

24:11
macron because in France Patrick Bui is known most 
eminently for one thing feminization surgery he is  

24:22
the king of transgendered feminization surgery to 
soften the face feature if you are a man trying to  

24:29
become a woman it will soften your face features 
with feminization surgery and if there was any  

24:35
question that was remaining in anyone's Minds as 
to whether or not he was indeed being used by Brit  

24:43
macron they needed to just wait until 2023 because 
here's a picture of them together yeah years later  

24:50
in 2023 Emanuel macron decided to award Dr 
Patrick buy with the French Legion of Honor  

24:58
a high distinction in the French Republic imagine 
the medal it's the medal of freedom in America  

25:04
he's being awarded that we're going to pause 
there because that is a lot of information for  

25:09
you to digest information for you to unpack and 
information for you to research again we are at  

25:14
the very tip of the iceberg when it comes to this 
couple and the connections and the power that they  

25:20
have and how they were able to execute this far 
in the public what we will show you in the next  

25:25
episode is how the story line begins falling 
apart and we can can bring up that timeline   again how this perfectly curated idea um of Brigitte's 
background absent any pictures people started to  

25:36
go wait a second something's not right here and it 
sort of begins with just a couple of pictures that  

25:42
are released of Brigitte macron in those years when 
she was allegedly a pinup doll and she didn't  

25:47
look anything like a pinup doll and uh she wasn't 
wearing short skirts she was wearing uh baggy  

25:54
suits and no it didn't seem like someone in which 
te teenagers would be falling over themselves here  

26:01
she is right here there she is in her teaching 
days that's the hot pinup Claudia schifferes and  

26:07
people began to go wait a second are we just being 
sold a bunch of lies and the answer of course is  

26:15
going to be yes but I want to first um get into 
showing you the letter that we received yesterday  

26:21
from Brigitte macron and Emanuel macron but first I am 
before we read that letter in its entirety going

27:59
don't even know what to say here I don't know what 
to say so obviously for those of you who have not   checked out the past episodes you should we will 
um here on YouTube we will put them all together  

28:09
so that you can see it as a series of everything 
that's happened with with Emanuel macron and Brigitte   mccrone uh they sent us a letter and essentially 
in that letter they did not address the substance  

28:19
of the claim that Brigitte macron was a woman but began 
to pick apart at other things that we had said and  

28:25
said this could be defamation because of this this 
could be defamation because of that we responded   to them and basically said look we're not in we're 
not in the business of lying we believe I believe  

28:34
rather kace believes that Brigitte macron was born a 
biological male we're not doing this for funsies  

28:39
obviously okay and um we're going to give you an 
opportunity to answer that these questions yes   or no very simple questions we went over in the 
first episode questions like did the first lady  

28:49
Brigitte macron give birth to three children yes 
or no you know was she born a biological male  

28:55
who is the person in this photo Etc Etc and they 
did not answer us at all and we gave them I think  

29:02
what would amount to 10 days more than 10 days 
perhaps to respond before we launched the first  

29:08
installment of our series that we got no such luck 
then after the first installment the introductory  

29:14
episode uh last night we received an email from 
their legal team here in the United States and I  

29:21
kid you not I'm just going to read it to you in 
its entirety because I've realized that they're   trying to assert the claim that we picked and 
chose what we read to you yeah it was a 100  

29:30
Page Letter we didn't have three hours and none 
of it answered our question as to whether or not   Brigitte Macron was a man we get that you're trying to 
pretend that mistakes about colorization you know  

29:40
could could amount to defam defamation we know 
your game so let's jump into this letter that   we received and I'll explain to you what they're 
referencing and what we said back to them in our  

29:49
letter um so you can see it starts with um letting 
us know that this is regarding or something in the  

29:56
corner there confidential not for publication or 
attribution I really fail at that uh then they  

30:02
say it's it's regarding false and defamatory 
statements about presidential emanuel macron and   Brigitte Macron they say we write again on behalf 
of our clients president and Mrs mrcon that's  

30:11
the last time I think you're going to hear really 
about Brigitte we were disappointed in your January   16th 2025 response to our December 3rd 2024 letter 
despite our warnings and with full knowledge of  

30:22
their falsity your client has doubled down on her 
defamatory allegations we're going to get to those   and indeed expanded the scope of her defamation we 
had wanted to spare Miss Owens the embarrassment  

30:33
of openly confronting her false claims but instead 
of doing the right and responsible thing it seems   she relishes in the public attention so basically 
they wrote me the first legal threat to spare me  

30:43
you guys they were just like we want to help 
you and let you know that some things you said   were wrong and so this letter is a warning 
to you how kind of this couple truly to find  

30:53
this in their heart let's keep reading since 
our letter Miss Owens has published several  

30:58
posts an additional broadcast podcast pardon 
further defaming the macron's to the extent that  

31:04
the macron's claims suffered from any of the legal 
deficiencies you pointed out in your letter which  

31:09
they did not miss Owens has eliminated any doubts 
about such claims and strengthened them with her   new statements most egregiously on January 13th 
2025 Miss Owens falsely implied that the mcon  

31:21
were responsible for the death of a journalist 
investigating them okay let's pause there because   you guys watched the first episode they're just 
lying here right there's just I literally told  

31:30
you that every journalist that tries to touch this 
story something happens to okay and it is a fact  

31:35
that Isabella fera was working on the story had 
messaged according to her friends saying that she  

31:40
had a bombshell About Emanuel macron and Brigitte
The French Press has reported on this and then she   was found dead floating in a river okay or a pond 
whatever it was and they the public said that she  

31:51
had drowned and her friends said that she was not 
suicidal and the public the Press said that she  

31:56
had maybe taken some pills I remember the point 
is is nowhere in the first episode did we say  

32:02
that Brigitte Macron and Emanuel macron assassinated 
this girl we told you what happened okay let's  

32:08
keep reading here that incendiary implication is 
factually false offensive and Incredibly damaging  

32:16
Miss Owens repeated this false claim on January 
31 31st 2025 and bolstered the implication because  

32:22
they're not saying I said it they're saying you 
implied it by stating that she meaning me did up  

32:28
on security after getting the letter from rron and 
the cause and because of things that we know about  

32:33
their Network and things that are happening like 
I said every journalist that tries to get this out   yes that is and not not that is not a lie that is 
the truth we have upped our security because and  

32:43
we were responding to the chat of people saying 
get yourself some good security and of course   when you have people walking around your property 
and you have young children and you understand the  

32:52
extent of the stakes that are in this getting an 
upping on your security that is my right okay you   don't get to tell me that I can't tell the public 
the truth about that let's keep reading to see  

33:01
what they're upset about in another outright lie 
Miss Owens has repeatedly stated that the macron's   admitted Mrs macron statutorily raped president 
mcon in our December 3rd letter that is a complete  

33:12
fabrication as no such admission was made within 
our December 3rd letter or anywhere else no to  

33:18
the contrary we showed exactly what you said 
where you admitted that aanuel mcon was 15 and   you admitted that uh bit was 39 and we said to out 
to the public that is therefore an admission that  

33:30
it is statutory rape because the laws at that time 
stated that there could be no consent if the adult  

33:36
had authority over the child and given the fact 
that that was a teacher and Emanuel Macron was   15 years old and not of the age of consent that 
that would constitute statutory rape so we didn't  

33:46
say that you wrote that this is statutory rape we 
said that you admitted to it whether knowingly or  

33:52
Not by saying what I believe to be the first time 
asserting in writing that their ages were 39 and  

33:57
15 and to be clear we are asserting that their 
ages were actually in fact 39 and 14 because 14  

34:04
years old undeniably was the age in which Emanuel 
macrone participated in that play let's keep   reading your client's recklessness in making these 
false and damaging assertions is staggering it  

34:17
goes on you spend most of your letter discussing 
actual malice but the well documented evidence  

34:23
of actual malice here is overwhelming and your 
client has only added to that record with her   public public statements after receiving our 
letter as we laid out in our December 3rd 2024  

34:32
letter Miss Owens relies on facially unreliable 
sources to perpetuate an inherently improbable  

34:39
conspiracy theory despite the evidence refuting 
its truth Miss Owens claims she's a journalist  

34:45
but repeatedly disregards journalistic standards 
in her reporting she also continues to profit from   these lies and blocking out business name and even 
recently stated that she would start reselling the  

34:55
man of the year t-shirt mock Mrs macron and just 
as Miss Owens claims that she does not have to  

35:01
credit the macron's a court similarly will not 
be obligated to credit her claims in the face   of overwhelming evidence to proing disproving them 
so they're saying literally a lot of nothing here  

35:10
other than it's an improbable conspiracy theory 
all they have to do is write Brigitte Macron was born a  

35:17
biological female we are telling you that is a 
fact they won't do that Brigitte Macron gave birth to  

35:25
three children their names are Lauren Sebastian 
and tone we are asserting that as a fact please  

35:30
correct the record in our letter to them we said 
we are happy to correct the record we are happy to  

35:35
tell the truth we even offered to fly to France to 
conduct the interview so that Brigitte could respond  

35:42
on record herself we said any time any date you 
let us know from here until I think we gave them   until March something we will get on a plane we 
will fly to you because we don't want to lie about  

35:52
this and we're asking you to answer these very 
and if you don't want me to come and you don't   want to invite me in the L Palace then please 
just answer these 21 questions so that we can  

36:00
include it in our reporting they are declining 
to do so and instead saying it's an improbable   conspiracy theory that's it that's what they're 
saying okay let's keep going because the Letter's  

36:08
almost over this is all it says since receiving 
our letter Miss Owens has supplied us with even   more evidence okay sorry actually just went over 
that um uh oh no that's right since receiving  

36:18
our letter Ms Owens has supplied us with even 
more evidence of her Reckless disregard of the  

36:24
truth actual malice and intent to further injure 
the macron's Owens received overwhelming written  

36:30
notice of the evidence contradicting her claims in 
our December 3rd 2024 letter and yet she continues  

36:36
to double down and expand her lies she has refused 
to retract any of the defamatory claims outlined   in our letter Miss Owens also quoted from portions 
of our letter but refused to present her audience  

36:45
with much of the sub substantive evidence 
refuting her claims all of this is blatantly  

36:51
obvious attempt to further defame and injure the 
macron's and hide the truth from the audience she   has rep repeatedly lied to about these issues 
so essentially what they are saying is we sent  

36:59
you a 100 Page Letter and we went over everything 
that could potentially be defamatory like I said   to you ignoring the substance is Brigitte a man yes 
or no a biological male yes or no was she born a  

37:09
biological male yes or no and starting to nitpick 
colorizations of photos and they're actually going   to list the two things again so I don't need to 
be redundant here they're going to list parts of  

37:18
a letter that that were in their initial letter 
that we did not present to the public which is   why we're showing you this entire letter because 
it's ridiculous you're going to see exactly their  

37:25
pattern of not add addressing the substance and 
always going to nitpick things that they say are  

37:31
defamatory so let's keep going with this letter it 
goes Miss Owens mistakenly believes that her false  

37:38
statements about the macron's are protected by her 
freedom of speech and religion or at least thinks  

37:43
that it will be useful to her cause to throw 
those terms around defamation is not entitled  

37:49
to first amendment protection because quote there 
is no constitutional value in false statements of  

37:56
fact and then they list a a lawsuit some Jurish 
Prudence there thus Miss Owens cannot publish  

38:02
here it comes guys an accusation that she knows 
has no evidence behind it as a fact to fit her  

38:08
desired storyline and then cloak herself in the 
First Amendment a defamation claim premist in part  

38:14
here we go on Miss owens's false claims that the 
macron's are involved with a satanic cult does not  

38:21
implicate any religious belief where no such group 
even exists so they're saying here and this idea  

38:28
guilty is charged they did a whole segment in 
their first letter about me saying speaking   about satanic and Cults implying that they were 
in a satanic cult and they're saying that that is  

38:37
defamation to talk about Satan talk about satanic 
cult is a form of defamation and they're asking me  

38:42
to correct the record I'm saying I'm not doing 
that because as a Christian okay I know that   satanic Cults do actually exist and for them 
to allege that I said that they couldn't exist  

38:51
that they don't exist is as completely insane 
and a violation of um my right to practice My  

38:56
Religion so I'm not not I'm going to hold the 
line on that I'm going to go hold the line when   I which I did tell you guys on speaking about my 
viewpoint and the Viewpoint shared by many that  

39:06
the Olympic ceremony was satanic that is even the 
main participant Barbara Butch okay a lesbian who  

39:15
was at the center of that laughed about the New 
Testament in her Instagram story and then pulled  

39:20
it down you don't get the right to tell me that 
you're going to sue me for defamation because I'm  

39:25
talking about Satanism in a context that makes 
you uncomfortable since you handpicked Thomas   Jolly to put on this performance my answer is 
no so let's keep reading your letter and get to  

39:34
the other point that you feel that I've taken 
away okay likewise the remaining false claims  

39:40
made by Miss Owens are not based on her religious 
beliefs just because she uses religious rhetoric   to gain followers yeah that's what I'm doing 
every Mass every Sunday I'm just trying to gain  

39:48
followers your equally ridiculous explanation to 
Excuse miss owens's false statement from legal  

39:54
liability that the statements are supposedly 
rhetorical hyper verbally also fail so my my  

39:59
um on this next portion my lawyer wrote back 
to them because they said another defamatory   claim was me saying Emanuel Macron is a psycho and 
they're alleging that that is a defamation again  

40:09
none of this is about the substance of the claim 
that b a man um but we're going to give you what   their what their response to is that first if Miss 
Owens sincerely believes that what she says which  

40:19
she repeatedly claims the statements are not 
rhetorical hyperbole statements that consist   of rhetorical hyperbole a vigorous epithet or 
loose figurative or hyperbolic language are  

40:28
protected because they cannot reasonably be 
interpreted as stating actual facts about an  

40:33
individual Miss Owens cannot simultaneously take 
the position that she believes the truth of her  

40:38
defamatory assertions and that those statements 
are exaggerations that no reasonable person would  

40:44
take seriously as statements of reported fact 
if anything this nonsensical argument in your   letter only further demonstrates that Miss Owens 
deliberately distorts the truth for shock value to  

40:52
our audience a further admission of her malice 
and financial incentive to defame the macron  

40:58
moreover the context of her statements flatly 
disproves any notion that Miss Owens was not   seriously maintaining an assertion of actual fact 
to the contrary Miss Owens repeatedly asserts that  

41:08
she is providing facts and recently noted a trove 
of evidence of her false claims Miss Owens stated   this clearly and eliminated any doubt that she 
was engaging in rhetorical hyperbole when she  

41:17
claimed on January 10th 2024 that she is exposing 
what she deems to be the truth previously she made  

41:24
the defamatory assertion that president M's 
a psychopath while citing research supposedly  

41:30
supporting her allegation and claims that Mrs 
macron's purported sexual abuse of President   macron turned him into a psychopath with her 
claiming to expose the truth that is supported  

41:40
by research no reasonable listener could possibly 
believe that Miss Owens was engaging in rhetorical   hyperbole not meant to be taken seriously so 
I'm showing you this full letter because it's  

41:48
important for you to understand this is the exact 
strategy that they have gone after reporters okay  

41:54
in in in France when you see suddenly the main 
media goes she won a defamation claim it's never   about whether or not Brigitte Macron is a man she's 
never won that ever it's always about this person  

42:04
identified the wrong person in the photo she's 
saying that Emanuel Macron was a psychopath   does she have the um the credentials is she able 
to as a non PhD in Psychiatry to assert that he's  

42:18
a psychopath I'm going to go to court and find 
out and then when they win and they get like   a you know a civil harassment charge the their 
media who I just explained to you in this episode  

42:27
how they control that media rushes to print that 
they she won a defamation suit have you heard them  

42:33
once throughout this entire entire letter simply 
assert that Brigitte Macron was in fact born a female  

42:41
have you heard them assert that Brigitte Macron did 
not the current first lady transition no it's  

42:47
petty little claims this this is and this is just 
the end of the letter here that I'm not hiding   anything from you let's keep going and yes it 
is true both of these things were in their first  

42:55
letter about him being a psychopath and about 
satanic Cults they wrote that your claim that  

43:00
macron that the macron's have not been damaged by 
your client false statements is further be lied by  

43:06
the second sentence of your January 16th letter in 
your words Candace is an international sensation a  

43:11
thank you lawyer thank you my I got a good lawyer 
he's so kind her false claims have reached an   international audience the views the likes the 
comments the downloads the shares of her false  

43:20
statements provide conclusive proof that Miss 
owens's Fabrications are believed and repeated it  

43:25
is self-evident that Miss Owens proliferation of 
these false claims has resulted in impairment of  

43:31
reputation and standing in the community personal 
humiliation mental anguish and suffering suffering  

43:38
so much so ladies and gentlemen that they won't 
just simply answer the basic question that we are  

43:45
asking are you Brigitte Macron were you Brigitte Macron 
born a biological female Circle yes or no please  

43:56
stop with these letters please anyways it wraps 
up by them demanding this rather bizarre demand  

44:03
lastly your letter do not acknowledge our legal 
hold demand for your convenience we repeat it   here till these issues are resolved please ensure 
that your principles and all of your sources are  

44:11
preserving and retaining emails and text messages 
audio Vis recordings yeah okay dummy it's all here   on YouTube okay like oh what do you think we're 
hiding we've already asserted what we think I've  

44:21
said it a thousand times I believe Brigitte Macron was 
born a biological male okay and then transition  

44:27
into a female that's that is my belief I don't 
know how many times I could say it what do you   think you're going to find in my messages like 
what what's your Smoking Gun here you got it you  

44:34
got it dude we're acknowledging it publicly we 
will keep all of our YouTube files we will keep  

44:40
all the video files we'll keep our text messages 
our logs our tweets okay our tweets so you can  

44:45
show that I meant what I said what I said then 
you can explain why it is you can't just answer   the questions again this is just an intimidation 
tactic they obviously have not answered any of our  

44:55
questions to put an end to this which completely 
removes them from this cleaning that they're being   so mentally anguished but they can't just simply 
assert the truth dancing around things that nobody  

45:03
cares about nobody cares she called Emanuel Macron 
psycho that is just that hurts but he didn't care  

45:10
obviously uh when the Algerian press referred 
to him as a homosexual psychopath they weren't  

45:16
sued it's coming after Candace now a lot of people 
have asserted that Emanuel macron is a psychopath   and have not been sued but he wants us to know 
he's really serious he's coming to Tennessee I  

45:24
think do it stop wasting your with these letters 
go file the lawsuit okay the entire world wants  

45:30
to know the answer to the question and I believe 
I already know the answer to the question like I   said we are peeling back the layers of this onion 
very slowly helping people to understand who is in  

45:39
your circle how we were able to pull this off how 
you were able to Gaslight the entire world what  

45:46
you're doing right now okay because this is what 
you do we're going to reveal your legal strategy   of not addressing the elephant in the room as 
you complain about things around it oh gosh  

45:57
she said psycho she said he's a psycho how could 
she say that he's so hurt he's anguished you're   pathetic Emanuel okay you're absolutely pathetic 
this this letter is pathetic so when you send me  

46:07
back a letter and then quote me saying that 
it's pathetic just know I'm going to stand by   that too okay I believe in Satanism I don't think 
it's a figment of anybody's imagination first and  

46:16
foremost so good luck with that in American 
Court especially in in the South where people   still have faith you know and uh good luck trying 
to prove that you're not a psycho when a t of  

46:27
people have reported in the press that you are 
Psychopathic and that they saw that during covid  

46:32
um tons of people wrote about that about your 
mental condition and you will never ever ever   get me to transform my opinion that you were 
groomed by the person you eventually married  

46:40
in 2007 Brigitte Macron I believe she's a man how 
many more times can I say it how many more ways  

46:46
can I say it should I say it in French should I 
should I learn a little bit of French to say it   in another way this is just getting ridiculous 
okay the entire public is now paying attention  

46:57
Emanuel and Brigitte and I know you're staying up late 
to watch this at the El Palace probably all in   a room you're probably standing next to your next 
PR agent now that you've sunk MiMi because things  

47:06
were becoming apparent about her history I know 
that you're worried about this not because of  

47:12
somebody calling you a psycho how thin skinned 
could a G7 leader get okay but you're worried   about the substance and we're going to get to the 
substance and the entire world is going to watch  

47:21
us do it so I conclude this Mr and Mr Macron by 
thanking you you for promoting this series in the  

47:28
only way that you know how by crying like little 
babies publicly and thinking that I'm going to  

47:34
keep this private or secret I believe in radical 
transparency I tell my followers everything  

47:39
because I view them as friends I don't even view 
them as fans I view them as people who like me are   concerned citizens who have a right to know who 
the hell is running our countries it's that simple  

47:50
and I'm very concerned about who is running your 
country very concerned about it I'm very concerned   about their ties to the American Media and I'm 
very concerned concerned that most people in  

47:58
the world are just hearing about this story which 
is demented okay and it gets more demented every  

48:03
episode so we're not going to stop and whoever it 
is behind the DDOS attacks you're not going to be   able to stop this those you that are watching 
we ask you to support our work as independent  

48:13

do that is to go to CandaceOwens.com you can give a  

48:18

48:35
are aware that everything that we do we we take 
tremendous risk but we feel that it is necessary  

48:41
risk to protect children and uh that's what this 
is about at the end of the day protecting children  

48:47
uh from people that we believe are predatory and 
I believe that Brigitte macron was a predator make   no mistake I believe she is a predator believe 
that she's manipulating the press and manipulating  

48:57
the uh courtrooms it's predatory manipulating 
journalists trying to shut down speech all of  

49:03
it's predatory so that is our conclusion you guys 
thank you so much for tuning in to episode one
