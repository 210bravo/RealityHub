Unconventional does not mean the Rx does not work.

Unconventional means the Rx has not made it into conventional textbooks.

What if I told you, your mitochondria mirror stellar electrostatic UV emissions, making cells inward-turned stars?   Sounds nuts until you remember all the bread crumbs I have left for you.  

I have mentioned on this forum and in blogs that the 2018 Nobel Prize was the tip of the spear of my massive Webinar done in 2018, and what is life.  Mourou's speech to the Nobel committee uncovers a vast amount of data on the nuclear transmutation of elements using CPA.  If you rewatch that webinar and are reading the DM series, you might begin to see why I hacked the periodic table 20 years ago after reading Russian literature.  

The 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics, awarded to Gérard Mourou and Donna Strickland for their work on chirped pulse amplification (CPA), highlights the creation of high-intensity, ultra-short laser pulses. This mimics what mitochondria do.  How many times have you heard me say the sun and mitochondria have a lot in common?  I believe your mitochondria are a biological cyclotron that can make an element as needed.  Humans flying in a plane at altitude during a solar minimum increases cosmic radiation, and this ruins the recursive loop that runs in you.    
  
In the Nobel experiments, CPA stretches, amplifies, and recompresses laser pulses (think coherent UPEs), enabling applications such as nuclear waste transmutation by bombarding isotopes to reduce their half-lives. Mitochondria may use time-stamped UPEs similarly, with [[Melanin]]’s recursive loop generating precise biophoton pulses to modulate mtDNA and transmute elements, mimicking CPA’s temporal precision at the nanoscale.

What Would the Mitochondrial Transmutation Sequence Look like? 

- UV photon from coherent UPE ejects K-shell electron, first ionizing the atom.
    
- This destabilized the Nucleus electrically.
    
- Then, a mitochondria-generated neutrino flips a proton to a neutron.
    
- An atom reconfigures into an isotope or a new element (e.g., cobalt, iron).
    
- The cell harvests the element via redox feedback.
    

If you realize the cell is doing this, adding new atoms to the cell is very, very unwise.  I think our government inside of DARPA learned this in the 1960s and that is how they started building the bioweapons program.
