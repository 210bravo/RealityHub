# Summary of [[Jack Kruse, MD|Jack Kruse]]'s Tweet Thread (1912514720537473206)

[[Jack Kruse, MD|Dr. Jack Kruse]] presents an intricate thread beginning on April 16, 2025, that builds upon Felix Scholkmann’s hypothesis of [[Myelin]] as a proton capacitor. Kruse introduces a photo-bioelectric framework, linking myelin’s evolution to UV light, oxygen dynamics, and quantum biological processes. This thread, spanning multiple posts, challenges centralized neuroscience and biophysics, advocating a first-principles approach to understanding sleep, nervous system complexity, and modern diseases like [[Multiple Sclerosis]] (MS) and type 1 diabetes (T1D). Below is a comprehensive breakdown of his arguments:

## 1. Photo-Bioelectric Foundation and [[Myelin]]’s Role
- Kruse aligns with Scholkmann’s idea that myelin stores energy as a proton capacitor during sleep and supplies it during wakefulness but expands it with a photo-bioelectric lens.
- He argues myelin’s evolution in jawed fishes (placoderms, ~425 million years ago) coincided with opsin expansion ([[Melanopsin]], encephalopsin, neuropsin), driven by a UV light surge post-Cambrian explosion.
- Myelin serves two purposes: optimizing membrane function for nerve conduction in the central and peripheral nervous systems (CNS/PNS) and acting as an energy-efficient proton capacitor, a role he ties to biophoton-mediated processes.

## 2. Evolutionary Context: From Sleep to Wakefulness
- Kruse posits that life’s default state was sleep, with wakefulness evolving as a response to increased UV light from the sun, which rose by 10-20% ~200 million years after the Cambrian explosion (~538 million years ago).
- This UV increase, peaking around the Devonian period, enhanced ultraweak biophoton production (400-700nm) in mtDNA, heme proteins, and [[Melanin]], fueling nervous system complexity in vertebrates.
- He suggests encephalization in mammals, particularly humans, relied on myelin to reduce sleep dependency, allowing greater cognitive and behavioral adaptability.

## 3. UV Light and Opsin Expansion
- Kruse details how the UV surge drove opsin diversification, with [[Melanopsin]], encephalopsin, and neuropsin becoming integral to the modern human brain’s photo-sensitivity.
- He connects this to the Great Oxidation Event (GOE, ~2.3 billion years ago), where oxygen levels shifted from a holocaust to a resource, setting the stage for UV-driven evolution 2 billion years later.
- The opsin expansion in jawed fishes enabled light-based signaling, with myelin evolving to harness these biophotons, supporting rapid nerve conduction and energy efficiency.

## 4. Myelin’s Lipid Composition and Disease Links
- Kruse emphasizes myelin’s lipid-rich structure—cholesterol, sphingolipids, and plasmalogens—interacting with UV light (200-350nm) and oxygen tensions.
- He argues this composition explains the latitude etiology of MS, where reduced UV exposure impairs myelin’s proton capacitor function, leading to white matter loss observed in autopsies.
- He notes similar white matter degradation in T1D, suggesting a shared UV-light deficiency mechanism, challenging dietary-focused theories in centralized medicine.

## 5. Biophoton Emission and Oxygen Dynamics
- Kruse highlights ultraweak biophoton emission as a cellular signaling mechanism, originating from mitochondrial oxidative processes and modulated by oxygen levels.
- Under hypoxia (e.g., post-GOE or post-Cambrian), increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) enhance biophoton output, influencing myelin’s energy storage and release.
- He suggests biophotons, absorbed by [[Melanin]] or heme proteins, optimize mitochondrial ATP production, reducing sleep needs and supporting wakefulness evolution.

## 6. Metabolic Adaptations and Citric Acid Cycle
- Kruse proposes that hypoxic conditions post-GOE triggered a reverse operation of the citric acid cycle, converting α-ketoglutarate to isocitrate to generate succinyl-CoA.
- This metabolic shift fed the mevalonate pathway, supporting cholesterol and sphingolipid synthesis for early myelin formation, a process rare in pre-vertebrate life.
- He argues this adaptation allowed life to exploit oxygen and UV light, laying the groundwork for myelin’s later sophistication in vertebrates.

## 7. Impact of Reduced UV Light on Health
- Kruse asserts that scarce UV light in modern environments impairs myelin’s proton capacitor function, necessitating alternative metabolic adaptations.
- This impairment leads to poor sleep and regeneration in MS and T1D patients, as biophoton emission weakens, disrupting mitochondrial efficiency.
- He contrasts this with ancestral conditions, where ample UV supported myelin’s role in reducing sleep dependency, enhancing survival.

## 8. Critique of Centralized Biology
- Kruse criticizes centralized biology and biophysics for ignoring UV light and oxygen’s roles in myelin evolution, focusing instead on membrane optimization alone.
- He calls the omission of ultraweak photon emission (UPE) spectra and oxygen tensions a critical flaw, urging research into how myelin’s lipid composition interacts with these factors.
- He advocates first-principles thinking, suggesting labs explore UPE modulation by oxygen to uncover myelin’s full bioenergetic potential, a direction he pioneered 20 years ago.

## 9. Supporting Evidence and Future Directions
- Kruse cites fluorescence data: pure cholesterol emits 350-400nm under UV (~240nm), glycosphingolipids 400-500nm when oxidized, and myelin proteins (tyrosine, tryptophan) 300-380nm, quenched by energy transfer to lipids or water.
- He connects “white” myelin to semiconductor-like properties, absorbing UV and emitting across visible spectra, hinting at quantum mechanisms yet to be explored.
- He recommends biophysicists study UPE spectra under varying oxygen tensions, tailoring myelin composition to environmental light, a research path he believes centralized science neglects.

## 10. Conclusion and Call to Action
- Kruse concludes that myelin’s evolution reflects a light-driven, oxygen-mediated story, with modern diseases like MS and T1D stemming from UV deficiency.
- He challenges the scientific community to adopt his decentralized thesis, warning that food-centric or biochemical models miss the biophysical reality he describes.
- The thread ends with an invitation to follow his “red light”—his insights—toward a deeper understanding of nature’s cellular game.

This thread presents a radical reinterpretation of myelin’s role, weaving UV light, biophotons, and oxygen into a narrative of evolutionary and health significance, urging a paradigm shift in biological research.
