## Summary

[[Anjan Katta]], founder and CEO of [[Daylight Computer]], discusses the health risks of blue light and [[Non-Native Electromagnetic Fields]] ([[nnEMFs]]) from modern screens, drawing on [[Steve Jobs]]’ early warnings about technology’s potential harms. Katta critiques Silicon Valley’s profit-driven tech culture, which prioritizes addiction over well-being, and introduces his Daylight Computer, a blue-light-free, flicker-free, sunlight-readable tablet designed to mitigate these effects. The episode explores the biological impacts of [[Non-Native Electromagnetic Fields|nnEMFs]], the manipulative design of modern technology, and Katta’s vision for a “solarpunk” future of health-focused, decentralized computing. Conspiracy discussions touch on Big Tech’s intentional harm and societal control, but avoid explicit globalist or [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] socialist narratives seen in other episodes (e.g., #277, #305).

### Key Concepts Discussed

1. Health Effects of [[Blue Light]] and [[Non-Native Electromagnetic Fields|nnEMFs]] (00:30:05, Steve Jobs Knew the Danger of Blue Light; 00:45:39, How Phone Scrolling Affects Your Breathing;,,):
    
    - [[Circadian Rhythm Disruption]]: Blue light from screens suppresses melatonin production, disrupting sleep and circadian rhythms, leading to insomnia, fatigue, and hormonal imbalances (e.g., cortisol, leptin). Katta cites studies showing blue light’s impact on sleep quality (Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, 2010).
    - Screen Apnea: Phone scrolling causes shallow breathing, termed “screen apnea,” increasing anxiety and stress by reducing oxygen intake and elevating cortisol (00:45:39;).
    - [[Mitochondrial Dysfunction]]: [[Non-Native Electromagnetic Fields|nnEMFs]], including blue light, disrupt mitochondrial function by altering cellular water structure and voltage-gated calcium channels, contributing to oxidative stress, inflammation, and chronic diseases like obesity and diabetes.
    - Neurological and Psychological Effects: Prolonged screen exposure fosters addiction, reduces focus, and increases anxiety, with Katta noting tech’s design to hijack dopamine pathways, making users “dumber, fatter, and sadder” (00:09:11, Modern Tech is Rotten;).
    - Eye Strain and Physical Health: Blue light and screen flicker cause eye strain, headaches, and potential long-term vision damage, exacerbated by [[Non-Native Electromagnetic Fields|nnEMF]] exposure (,).

2. [[Steve Jobs]]’ Warnings and Tech’s Harmful Design (00:30:05;,):

    - Katta references Steve Jobs’ awareness of technology’s downsides, noting Jobs restricted his children’s use of iPhones and iPads due to health and addiction concerns (). Jobs’ vision of computers as “bicycles for the mind” contrasts with modern tech’s addictive design ().
    - Modern devices are engineered to maximize engagement, using blue light and algorithms to exploit psychological vulnerabilities, prioritizing profits over health (00:02:23, Hindering vs. Helpful Technology).
        
3. Daylight Computer and Mitigation Strategies (00:36:23, Developing a Blue Light Free Computer; 01:06:51, Daylight Computer).

    - Katta’s Daylight Computer (DC-1 tablet, priced at $729) uses a proprietary Live Paper display that eliminates blue light, flicker, and [[Non-Native Electromagnetic Fields|nnEMF]] emissions, promoting focus and health (,). The sunlight-readable design encourages outdoor use, aligning with circadian rhythms ().
    - Strategies to reduce [[Non-Native Electromagnetic Fields|nnEMF]] exposure include using blue-light-blocking glasses, minimizing screen time, and adopting decentralized technologies like Nostr and [[Bitcoin]] distributed identity for user control (01:25:47, New Decentralized Computing Stack;).

4. Conspiracy Discussions and Big Tech’s Intentions (00:25:27, Amusing Ourselves to Death; 01:01:38, Banality of Evil;,):

    - Katta draws on [[Neil Postman]]’s Amusing Ourselves to Death, arguing that tech giants create a “Brave New World” scenario where users love their oppression through addictive technology, not Orwellian force (00:25:27;,). He suggests Big Tech intentionally designs devices to harm, citing Hannah Arendt’s “banality of evil” to describe engineers’ complicity in optimizing for addiction without questioning consequences (01:01:38;).
    - He implies a systemic agenda to keep users distracted and unhealthy, though he stops short of naming specific groups like [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] socialists or globalist entities (unlike #277 or #305). The “grey alien timeline” (00:49:51) metaphorically refers to a dystopian future driven by harmful tech, contrasted with a “solarpunk timeline” of health-focused innovation (00:56:09;).

5. Silicon Valley’s Resistance and Funding Challenges (00:17:55, Getting Laughed Out of Silicon Valley; 01:14:29, Raising Money / Venture Capital;):
 
    - Katta faced skepticism from Silicon Valley for prioritizing health over profit, funding Daylight through individual investors who shared his vision, not venture capital (). This reflects a broader industry bias against human-centric technology.
    
6. Philosophical and Cultural Critique (00:00:00, Hanuman the Monkey God; 00:56:09, The Solar Punk Timeline;):

    - Katta’s upbringing, influenced by his psychiatrist father and Hindu mythology (e.g., Hanuman), shaped his mission to align technology with human flourishing (00:00:00;). He advocates a “solarpunk” approach, balancing technology and nature, against Silicon Valley’s “accelerationist” push toward unchecked innovation ().

### Critical Examination

Katta’s claims about blue light’s health effects are supported by research showing circadian disruption and sleep issues (Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, 2010), but long-term links to chronic diseases like obesity or diabetes are less conclusive, requiring further study. The concept of screen apnea is emerging but lacks robust clinical validation. [[Non-Native Electromagnetic Fields|nnEMF]] effects on mitochondria are plausible, supported by studies on voltage-gated calcium channels (Bioelectromagnetics, 2016), but mainstream science debates their significance at typical exposure levels. Katta’s conspiracy narrative—Big Tech’s intentional harm—echoes critiques of addictive design (Amusing Ourselves to Death), but lacks evidence of a coordinated agenda beyond profit motives. His references to Jobs’ warnings are anecdotal, based on reports of Jobs’ parenting choices, not public statements.
