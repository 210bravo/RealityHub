PROLOGUE 


V incent Bugliosi was on another tirade. 


“Nothing could be worse than accusing a prosecutor of doing what you’re 
implying that I did in this case,” he barked at me. “It’s extremely, extremely 
defamatory.” 

It was a sunny day in February 2006, and we were in the kitchen of his 
Pasadena home. The place was cozy, with floral patterns, overstuffed 
furniture, and—literally—a white picket fence out front, all belying the 
hostility erupting within its walls. Bugliosi wanted to sue me. It would be, he 
soon warned, “a hundred-million-dollar libel lawsuit,” and “one of the 
biggest lawsuits ever in the true-crime genre.” If I refused to soft-pedal my 
reporting on him, I’d be powerless to stop it. 

“T think we should view ourselves as adversaries,” he’d tell me later. 

Vince—I was on a first-name basis with him, as I guess adversaries must 
be—was a master orator, and this was one of his trademark perorations. Our 
interview that day dragged on for more than six hours, and he did most of the 
talking, holding forth as expertly as he had when he prosecuted the Charles 
Manson trial more than thirty-five years before. Seventy-one and in 
shirtsleeves, Vince still cut an imposing figure, hectoring me over a Formica 
table strewn with legal pads, notes, tape recorders, pens, and a stack of books 
—all written by him. Wiry and spry, his eyes a steely blue, he would sit down 
only to leap up again and point his finger in my face. 

Riffling through the pages of one of his yellow legal pads, he read from 
some remarks he’d prepared. “I’m a decent guy, Tom, and I’m going to 
educate you a little about just how decent Vince Bugliosi is.” 

And so he did—reciting a prewritten “opening statement” that lasted for 
forty-five minutes. He insisted on beginning this way. He’d dragooned his 


wife, Gail, into serving as a witness for the proceedings, just in case I’d try to 
misrepresent him. Essentially, he’d turned his kitchen into a courtroom. And 
in a courtroom, he was in his element. 

Bugliosi had made his name with the Manson trial, captivating the nation 
with stories of murderous hippies, brainwashing, race wars, and acid trips 
gone awry. Vince was sure to remind me, early and often, that he’d written 
three bestselling books, including Helter Skelter, his account of the Manson 
murders and their aftermath, which became the most popular true-crime book 
ever. If he seemed a little keyed up that day, well, so was I. My task was to 
press him on some of his conduct in the Manson trial. There are big holes in 
Helter Skelter: contradictions, omissions, discrepancies with police reports. 
The book amounts to an official narrative that few have ever thought to 
question. But I’d found troves of documents—many of them unexamined for 
decades, and never before reported on—that entangled Vince and a host of 
other major players, like Manson’s parole officer, his friends in Hollywood, 
the cops and lawyers and researchers and medical professionals surrounding 
him. Among many other things, I had evidence in Vince’s own handwriting 
that one of his lead witnesses had lied under oath. 

I sometimes wonder if Vince could see what a bundle of nerves I was that 
day. I’m not a churchgoing person, but I’d gone to church that morning and 
said a little prayer. My mom always told me I should pray when I need help, 
and that day I needed all the help I could get. I hoped that my interview with 
Vince would mark a turning point in my seven years of intensive reporting on 
the Manson murders. I’d interviewed more than a thousand people by then. 
My work had left me, at various points, broke, depressed, and terrified that I 
was becoming one of “those people”: an obsessive, a conspiracy theorist, a 
lunatic. I’d let friendships fall away. My family had worried about my sanity. 
Manson himself had harangued me from prison. I’d faced multiple threats on 
my life. I don’t consider myself credulous, but I’d discovered things I thought 
impossible about the Manson murders and California in the sixties—things 
that reek of duplicity and cover-up, implicating police departments up and 
down the state. Plus, the courts. Plus—though I have to take a deep breath 
before I let myself say it—the CIA. 

If I could get Bugliosi to admit any wrongdoing, or even to let a stray 
detail slip, I could finally start to unravel dozens of the other strands of my 
reporting. Maybe soon I could get my life back, whatever that might look 


like. At the very least, I could know that I’d done all I could to get to the 
bottom of this seemingly endless hole. 

Sitting in his kitchen, though, and watching the hours wear on as Vince 
defended and fortified every point he made, my heart sank. He was 
stonewalling me. I could hardly get a word in edgewise. 

“Tt’s a tribute to your research,” he told me. “You found something that I 
did not find.” In the closest thing I got to a concession, he said, “Some things 
may have gotten past me.” But, he added, “I would never in a trillion years 
do what you’re suggesting. Okay? Never. My whole history would be 
opposed to that. And number two, Tom, even if I had the thought that you’re 
suggesting”—of suborning perjury—“it goes nowhere. It’s preposterous. It’s, 
it’s silly... Who cares? It means nothing!” 

Who cares? I’ve asked myself that a lot over the years. Was it worth 
investing so much of my time and energy in these, some of the most well- 
known, worn-out crimes in American history? How did I end up falling into 
this, anyway? I remember glancing over at Gail, Vince’s wife, during his 
long, stentorian “opening statement.” She was leaning against the counter 
looking exhausted, her eyelids drooping. Eventually, she excused herself to 
go upstairs and lie down. She must’ve heard it all a thousand times before, 
his scripted lines, his self-aggrandizement. When I’m down on myself, I 
imagine everyone feels like Gail did that day. Oh, no, not the Manson 
murders, again. We’ve been through this. We’ve processed this. We know 
everything there is to know. Don’t drag us back into this story. 

I was almost heartened, then, to see that Vince was so anxious. That’s 
what kept me going, knowing that I’d gotten under his skin. Why would he 
be so committed to stopping this? And if what I’d discovered was really 
“nothing,” why had so many of his former colleagues told me otherwise? 

Another one of my sources had tipped off Vince about my reporting, 
giving him the ludicrous idea that I believed he’d framed Manson. That was 
dead wrong. I’ve never been a Manson apologist. I think he was every bit as 
evil as the media made him out to be. But it is true that Stephen Kay— 
Vince’s coprosecutor on the case, and no friend of his—had been shocked by 
the notes I’d found in Vince’s handwriting, telling me they could be enough 
to overturn all the verdicts against Manson and the Family. That was never 
my goal, though. I just wanted to find out what really happened. “I don’t 
know what to believe now,” Kay told me. “If he [Vince] changed this, what 


else did he change?” 

I wanted to know the same thing, but Vince always found a way to change 
the subject. “Where does it go?” he kept asking. “What’s the point?” The 
point, as I saw it, was that an act of perjury called the whole motive for the 
murders into question. Vince was too busy patronizing me about my motives 
to take that into consideration. How could I dare insinuate that he’d done 
something wrong? How could I live with myself if I tarnished his sterling 
reputation? He liked to bring up “the Man in the Mirror,” as if he, and not 
Michael Jackson, had popularized the phrase. “You cannot get away,” Vince 
said, “you cannot get away from him!” I tried to steer the conversation back 
to Manson, but Vince was having none of it. He wanted to recite some 
“testimonials” about his good character, to “read them into the record.” 

Both of us had showed up that day with two tape recorders—I was as 
scrupulous as he was, and neither of us wanted to risk having an incomplete 
account of the conversation. Over and over, whenever the intensity mounted 
and Vince had something sensitive to say, he would demand that we go off 
the record, meaning each of us had to shut off two machines, sometimes just 
for a few seconds, only to turn them all back on again. Often he’d forget one 
of his, and I’d have to say, “Vince, you didn’t turn it off.” 

Off the record, he’d lash into me again, his eyes piercing under that silver 
crescent of hair. “If you do the book and it’s legally defamatory, you have to 
realize one thing,” he said. “You have to realize I have no choice. I have to 
sue you.” 

By the time I left his house, I had a headache from all his shouting, and 
the sun had set behind the San Gabriel Mountains. Gail had never bothered to 
come downstairs again. Outside, before I got to my car, Vince grabbed my 
arm and reminded me that a blurb from him could boost the sales of my book 
—and he’d be happy to offer one, provided the manuscript passed muster 
with him. “That’s not a quid-pro-quo offer,” he added. But it seemed like one 
to me. 

Driving away, I felt despondent. I’d just gone toe-to-toe with one of the 
most famous prosecutors and true-crime authors in the world. Of course I 
hadn’t broken him. I knew I wasn’t alone, either. Other reporters had warned 
me that Vince could be ferocious. One of them, Mary Neiswender of the 
Long Beach Press Telegram and Independent, told me that Vince had 
threatened her back in the eighties, when she was preparing an exposé on 


him. He knew where her kids went to school, “and it would be very easy to 
plant narcotics in their lockers.” Actually, I didn’t even need other sources— 
Vince himself had told me mere minutes before that he had no compunction 
about hurting people to “exact justice or get revenge.” 

As it turned out, my reprieve was short-lived. I arrived at my home in 
Venice Beach to find that he’d already left me a message, wanting to talk 
about “a couple of follow-up things.” I called him back and we talked for 
another few hours. The next day, we had another phone call—then another, 
then another. When he saw that I wouldn’t back down, Vince only grew more 
exasperated. 

“If you vaguely imply to your readers that I somehow concealed evidence 
from the Manson jury,” he told me on the phone, “whether you believe it or 
not, the only thing you’re going to be accomplishing is jeopardizing your 
financial future and that of your publisher.” Demanding an apology, he 
assured me that I was treading “in dangerous waters”: “It’s possible the next 
time we see each other I’ ll be cross-examining you on the witness stand.” 

Fortunately, that never happened. The next time I saw Vince, it was June 
2011, and he was striding past me in an auditorium at the Santa Monica 
Library, where he was giving a talk. He’d noticed me—his adversary—in the 
crowd and paused as he made his way forward. 

“Are you Tom O’ Neill?” 

“Yes. Hi, Vince.” 

“Why are you so happy?” 

I must’ve been smiling out of nervousness. “I’m happy to see you,” I said. 

Studying me a bit, he asked, “Did you do something to your hair?” 

“No.” 

“Tt looks different.” He kept walking. And that was it. We never spoke 
again. Vince died in 2015. Sometimes I wish he were alive to read what 
follows, even if he’d try to sue me over it. I feel foolish for having expected 
to get firm answers from him. I replay the scenario in my head, figuring out 
where I could’ve caught him in a lie, where I should’ve pressed him harder, 
how I might’ve parried his counterattacks. I really thought that, with enough 
tenacity, I could get to the truth under all this. Now, most of the people who 
had the full story, including Manson himself, have died, and the questions I 
had then have continued to consume me for almost twenty years. But I’m 
certain of one thing: much of what we accept as fact is fiction.

The Crime of the Century 


Two Decades Overdue 


My life took a sharp left-hand turn on March 21, 1999, the day after my 
fortieth birthday—the day all this started. I was in bed with a hangover, as I’d 
been after countless birthdays before, and I felt an acute burst of self- 
loathing. I was a freelance journalist who hadn’t worked in four months. I’d 
fallen into journalism almost by accident. For years I’d driven a horse and 
carriage on the night shift at Central Park, and over time, my unsolicited 
submissions to magazines like New York had led to bigger and better 
assignments. While I was happy, now, to be living in Venice Beach and 
making a living as a writer, I missed New York, and mine was still a 
precarious existence. My friends had obligations: they’d started families, they 
worked long hours in busy offices, they led full lives. Even though my youth 
was behind me, I was so untethered that I could sleep into the afternoon— 
actually, I couldn’t afford to do much else at that point. I felt like a mess. 
When the phone rang, I had to make a real effort just to pick it up. 

It was Leslie Van Buskirk, my former editor from Us magazine, now at 
Premiere, with an assignment. The thirtieth anniversary of the Manson 
murders was coming up, and she wanted a reported piece about the 
aftershocks in Hollywood. So many years later, Manson’s name still served 
as a kind of shorthand for a very American form of brutal violence, the kind 
that erupts seemingly from nowhere and confirms the nation’s darkest fears 
about itself. The crimes still held great sway over the public imagination, my 
editor said. What was it that made Manson so special? Why had he and the 


Family lingered in the cultural conversation when other, even more macabre 
murders had faded from memory? Premiere was a film magazine, so my 
editor wanted me to talk to Hollywood’s old guard, the generation that had 
found itself in disturbing proximity to Manson, and to find out how they felt 
with three decades of perspective. It was a loose concept; Leslie trusted me to 
find a good direction for it, and to shape it into something unexpected. 

I almost said no. I’d never been particularly interested in the Manson 
murders. I was ten years old when they happened, growing up in 
Philadelphia, and though my brother swears up and down that he remembers 
me keeping a scrapbook about the crimes, I can’t recall how they affected me 
in the slightest. If anything, I thought I was one of the few people on the 
planet who’d never read Helter Skelter. Like an overplayed song or an iconic 
movie, Manson held little interest to me precisely because he was ubiquitous. 
The murders he’d ordered were often discussed as “the crime of the century,” 
and crimes of the century tend to be pretty well picked over. 

But I needed the job, and I trusted Leslie’s judgment. We’d worked 
together on a number of stories at Us—it was a monthly magazine then, not a 
weekly tabloid—and a piece like this, pitch-black, would be a welcome 
departure from my routine as an entertainment writer, which called for a lot 
of sit-down meetings with movie stars in their cushy Hollywood Hills homes, 
where they’d trot out lines about brave career choices and the need for 
privacy. That’s not to say the work was without its twists and turns. I’d 
gotten in a shouting match with Tom Cruise about Scientology; Gary 
Shandling had somehow found a way to abandon me during an interview in 
his own home; and I’d pissed off Alec Baldwin, but who hasn’t? 

I had some chops, in other words, but not much in the way of 
investigative bona fides. For a recent story about an unsolved murder, I’d 
chased down some great leads, but because my case was mostly 
circumstantial, the magazine sensibly decided to play it safe, and the piece 
came out toothless. 

This time, I thought, I could do better. In fact, through the fog of my 
hangover, I remember thinking: this will be easy. I agreed to file five 
thousand words in three months. Afterward, I thought, maybe I could move 
back to New York. 

Twenty years later, the piece isn’t finished, the magazine no longer exists, 
and I’m still in L.A. 


“A Picture Puzzle” 


Before I interviewed anyone, I read Helter Skelter. I saw what all the fuss 
was about: it was a forceful, absorbing book, with disquieting details I’d 
never heard before. In their infamy, the murders had always seemed to exist 
in a vacuum. And yet, reading Bugliosi’s account, what had seemed flat and 
played out was full of intrigue. 

I made notes and lists of potential interviews, trying to find an angle that 
hadn’t been worked over. Toward the beginning of the book, Bugliosi chides 
anyone who believes that solving murders is easy: 


In literature a murder scene is often likened to a picture puzzle. If one 
is patient and keeps trying, eventually all the pieces will fit into place. 
Veteran policemen know otherwise... Even after a solution emerges— 
if one does—there will be leftover pieces, evidence that just doesn’t 
fit. And some pieces will always be missing. 


He was right, and yet I wondered about the “leftover pieces” in this case. In 
Bugliosi’s telling, there didn’t seem to be too many. His picture puzzle was 
eerily complete. 

That sense of certitude contributed to my feeling that the media had 
exhausted the murders. The thought of them could exhaust me, too. Bugliosi 
describes Manson as “a metaphor for evil,” a stand-in for “the dark and 
malignant side of humanity.” When I summoned Manson in my mind, I saw 
that evil: the maniacal gleam in his eye, the swastika carved into his forehead. 
I saw the story we tell ourselves about the end of the sixties. The souring of 
the hippie dream; the death throes of the counterculture; the lurid, Dionysian 
undercurrents of Los Angeles, with its confluence of money, sex, and 
celebrity. 

Because we all know that story, it’s hard to discuss the Manson murders 
in a way that captures their grim power. The bare facts, learned and digested 
almost by rote, feel evacuated of meaning; the voltage that shot through 
America has been reduced to a mild jolt, a series of concise Wikipedia entries 
and popular photographs. In the way that historical events do, it all feels 


somehow remote, settled. 

But it’s critical to let yourself feel that shock, which begins to return as 
the details accumulate. This isn’t just history. It’s what Bugliosi called, in his 
opening statement at the trial, “a passion for violent death.” Despite the 
common conception, the murders are still shrouded in mystery, down to some 
of their most basic details. There are at least four versions of what happened, 
each with its own account of who stabbed whom with which knives, who said 
what, who was standing where. Statements have been exaggerated, recanted, 
or modified. Autopsy reports don’t always square with trial testimony; the 
killers have not always agreed on who did the killing. Obsessives continue to 
litigate the smallest discrepancies in the crime scenes: the handles of 
weapons, the locations of blood splatters, the coroner’s official times of 
death. Even if you could settle those scores, you’re still left with the big 
question—Why did any of this happen at all? 


Something to Shock the World 


August 8, 1969. The front page of that morning’s Los Angeles Times 
described an ordinary day in the city. Central Receiving Hospital had failed 
to save the life of a wounded policeman. The legislature had passed a new 
budget for schools, and scientists were optimistic that Mars’s south polar cap 
could be hospitable to alien life. In London, the Beatles had been 
photographed crossing the street outside their studio, a shot that would 
become the cover of Abbey Road. Walter Cronkite led the CBS Evening News 
with a story about the devaluation of the franc. 

The space race was in full swing, and Americans were dreaming, 
sometimes with a touch of trepidation, about the science-fictional future. Less 
than three weeks earlier, NASA had put the first man on the moon, an awe- 
inspiring testament to technological ingenuity. Conversely, the number one 
song in the country was Zager and Evans’s “In the Year 2525,” which 
imagined a dystopian future where you “ain’t gonna need to tell the truth, tell 
no lies / Everything you think, do, and say / Is in the pill you took today.” It 
would prove to be a more trenchant observation about the present moment 
than anyone would’ve thought. 

Late that night at the Spahn Movie Ranch, a man and three women got in 


a beat-up yellow 1959 Ford and headed toward Beverly Hills. A ranch hand 
heard one of the women say, “We’re going to get some fucking pigs!” 

The woman was Susan “Sadie” Atkins, twenty-one, who’d grown up 
mostly in San Jose. The daughter of two alcoholics, she’d been in her church 
choir and the glee club, and said that her brother and his friends would often 
molest her. She had dropped out of high school and moved to San Francisco, 
where she’d worked as a topless dancer and gotten into LSD. “My family 
kept telling me, “You’re going downhill, you’re going downhill, you’re going 
downhill,’” she would say later. “So I just went downhill. I went all the way 
down to the bottom.” 

Huddled beside her in the back of the car—they’d torn out the seats to 
accommodate more food from the Dumpster dives they often went on—was 
Patricia “Katie” Krenwinkel. Twenty-one, from Inglewood, Krenwinkel had 
developed a hormone problem as a kid, leading her to overeat and fear that 
she was ugly and unwanted. As a teen, she got into drugs and started to drink 
heavily. One day in 1967, she’d left her car in a parking lot, failed to collect 
the two paychecks from her job at an insurance company, and disappeared. 

In the passenger seat was Linda Kasabian, twenty, from New Hampshire. 
She’d played basketball in high school, but she dropped out to get married; 
the union lasted less than six months. Not long after, in Boston, she was 
arrested in a narcotics bust. By the spring of 1968, she’d remarried, had a kid, 
and moved to Los Angeles. She sometimes introduced herself as “Yana the 
witch.” 

And at the wheel was Charles “Tex” Watson, twenty-three and six foot 
three, from east Texas. Watson had been a Boy Scout and the captain of his 
high school football team; he sometimes helped his dad, who ran a gas station 
and grocery store. At North Texas State University, he’d joined a fraternity 
and started getting stoned. Soon he dropped out, moved to California, and got 
a job as a wig salesman. One day he’d picked up a hitchhiker who turned out 
to be Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys—a chance occurrence that changed 
both of their lives forever. 

That night in the Ford, all four were dressed in black from head to toe. 
None of them had a history of violence. They were part of a hippie commune 
that called itself the Family. Living in isolation at the Spahn Ranch—whose 
mountainous five hundred acres and film sets had once provided dramatic 
backdrops for Western-themed movies and TV shows—the Family had 


assembled a New Age bricolage of environmentalism, anti-establishment 
politics, free love, and apocalyptic Christianity, rounded out with a vehement 
rejection of conventional morality. More than anything, they lived according 
to the whims of their leader, the thirty-four-year-old Charles Milles Manson, 
who had commanded them to take their trip that night. 

The four arrived at 10050 Cielo Drive, where the actress Sharon Tate 
lived with her husband, the filmmaker Roman Polanski. He was away in 
London at the time, scouting locations for The Day of the Dolphin, a movie in 
which a dolphin is trained to assassinate the president of the United States. 

The drive to Cielo would’ve taken about forty minutes. It was just after 
midnight when they arrived. Benedict Canyon was quiet, seemingly worlds 
away from the hustle and sprawl of Los Angeles. The house, built in 1942, 
had belonged to a French actress, who’d modeled it on the Norman country 
estates of her youth. A long, low rambler at the end of a cul-de-sac, invisible 
from the street, it sat on three acres of bucolic, isolated land. Nestled against 
a hillside on a bluff, it afforded views of Los Angeles glittering to the east 
and Bel Air’s fulsome estates unfurling to the west. On a clear day, you could 
see straight to the Pacific, ten miles out. 

Watson scaled a pole to sever the phone lines to the house. He’d been here 
before, and he knew where to find them right away. There was an electric 
gate leading to the driveway, but instead of activating it, the four elected to 
jump over an embankment and drop onto the main property. All of them were 
carrying buck knives; Watson also had a .22 Buntline revolver. Kasabian 
remained on the outskirts, keeping watch. The other three crept up the hill 
toward the secluded estate. 

At the top of the driveway they found Steven Parent, an eighteen-year-old 
who’d been visiting the caretaker in the guesthouse to sell him a clock radio. 
He was sitting in his dad’s white Rambler, having already rolled his window 
down to activate the gate control. Watson approached the driver’s side and 
pointed the revolver at his face. “Please don’t hurt me, I won’t say anything!” 
Parent screamed, raising his arm to protect himself. Watson slashed his left 
hand with the knife, slicing through the strap of his wristwatch. Then he shot 
Parent four times, in his arm, his left cheek, and twice in the chest. Parent 
died instantly, his blood beginning to pool in the car. 

Those four shots rang out through Benedict Canyon, but no one in the 
house at 10050 Cielo seemed to hear them. It was a rustic home of stone and 


wood, its clapboard siding often described, in the many newspaper stories 
soon to follow, as tomato red. Beside the long front porch, a winding 
flagstone path led past a wishing well with stone doves and squirrels perched 
on its lip. There was a pool in the back and a modest guesthouse. The yard 
had low hedges, immense pines, and welcoming beds of daisies and 
marigolds. A white Dutch door opened into the living room, where a stone 
fireplace, beamed ceilings, and a loft with a redwood ladder provided a warm 
ambience. 

Finding no open windows or doors, Watson cut a long horizontal slit in a 
window screen outside the dining room and gained entry to the house; he 
went to the front door to let Atkins and Krenwinkel in. In the living room, the 
three killers came across Wojiciech “Voytek” Frykowski, a thirty-two-year- 
old Polish émigré and an aspiring filmmaker, asleep on the couch with an 
American flag draped over it. Frykowski was coming off a ten-day mescaline 
trip at the time. Having survived the brutal Second World War in Poland, 
he’d gone on to lead an aimless life in America, and friends thought there 
was something “brooding and disturbed” about him; he was part of a 
generation of Poles who’d been put on “a crooked orbit.” 

Now, rubbing his eyes to make out the figures clad in black and standing 
over him, Frykowski stretched his arms and, apparently mistaking them for 
friends, asked, “What time is it?” 

Watson trained his gun on Frykowski and said, “Be quiet. Don’t move or 
you’re dead.” 

Frykowski stiffened, the gravity of the situation beginning to seize him. 
“Who are you,” he asked, “and what are you doing here?” 

“Tm the devil and I’m here to do the devil’s business,” Watson replied, 
kicking Frykowski in the head. 

In a linen closet, Atkins found a towel and used it to bind Frykowski’s 
hands as best she could. Then, on Watson’s instructions, she cased the house, 
looking for others. She came to a bedroom, the door ajar, where she saw a 
woman reclining on a bed, reading: Abigail Folger, twenty-five, the heiress to 
a coffee fortune. She’d been staying at the house with Frykowski, her 
boyfriend, since April. Now she glanced up from her book, smiled, and 
waved at Atkins, who responded in kind and continued down the hall. 

She peered into a second bedroom, where a man sat on the edge of a bed, 
talking to a pregnant woman who lay there in lingerie. The man, Jay Sebring, 


thirty-five, was a hairstylist. His shop in Beverly Hills attracted a wealthy, 
famous clientele; he’d been the first one to cut hair in a private room, as 
opposed to a barbershop. He’d served in the navy during the Korean War. An 
intensely secretive man, he was rumored to allow only five people to keep his 
phone number. 

On the bed with him was his ex-girlfriend, Sharon Tate, then twenty-six 
and eight months pregnant with her first child. She’d recently filmed her 
biggest role to date, in The Thirteen Chairs, and her manager had promised 
she’d be a star someday. Born in Dallas, Tate was the daughter of an army 
officer, and she grew up in cities scattered across the globe. Her beauty was 
such that she’d apparently stopped traffic, literally, on her first visit to New 
York. She’d been a homecoming queen and a prom queen; even at six 
months old, she’d won a Miss Tiny Tot contest in Texas. A film career, she 
hoped, would get her noticed for something beyond her good looks. There on 
Cielo Drive, at the home she called the “Love House,” Tate was optimistic 
about the future. She believed her child would strengthen her marriage to 
Polanski, who sometimes demeaned her. 

Having reported back to Watson, Susan Atkins retied Frykowski’s hands 
with a piece of nylon rope. She went to bring the others into the living room, 
returning with Folger at knifepoint, and then with Sebring and Tate. “Come 
with me,” she’d told them. “Don’t say a word or you’re dead.” 

In their shock and confusion, they offered the intruders money and 
whatever they wanted, begging them not to hurt anyone. Watson ordered the 
three who’d come from the bedrooms to lie facedown on their stomachs in 
front of the fireplace. Tate began to cry; Watson told her to shut up. Taking a 
long rope, he tied Sebring’s hands behind his back and ran a length around 
his neck. He looped the rope around Tate’s neck next, and then Folger’s, 
throwing the final length over a beam in the ceiling. 

Sebring struggled to his feet and protested—couldn’t this man see that 
Tate was pregnant? He tried to move toward Tate, and Watson shot him 
twice, puncturing a lung. Sebring crumpled onto the zebra-skin rug by the 
fireplace. Since they were all tied together, his collapse forced the screaming 
Tate and Folger to stand on their toes to keep from being strangled. Watson 
dropped to his knees and began to stab the hairstylist incessantly; standing up 
again, he kicked Sebring in the head. Then he told Krenwinkel to turn off all 
the lights. 


Tate asked, “What are you going to do with us?” 

“You’re all going to die,” Watson said. 

Frykowski had managed to free his hands. He lurched toward Atkins, 
attempting to disarm her, but she forced her knife into his legs, stabbing him 
constantly as they rolled across the living room floor, a tangle of limbs 
glinting with steel. He pulled her long hair. His blood was spraying 
everywhere, and he’d been stabbed more than half a dozen times, but 
Frykowski staggered to his feet. Atkins had lost her knife, so he made a run 
for the front door and, with Atkins still pummeling him, got as far as the 
lawn. Watson halted him with two bullets and then tackled him to the ground, 
pounding the butt of his gun against the back of his head again and again, 
with such force that the right grip shattered, and Frykowski’s skull cracked. 

Inside, Tate was sobbing. Then Folger, who’d lifted the noose from her 
neck, shot out the front door, too. She was halfway across the front lawn, her 
nightgown flowing behind her like an apparition, when Krenwinkel caught up 
to her and brought her knife down, stabbing her twenty-eight times. Watson 
joined in and Folger went limp, saying, “I give up. I’m already dead. Take 
me.” 

Drenched in blood and their own sweat, the two killers rose to see 
Frykowski, yet again, on his feet stumbling toward them. Soon they were 
stabbing him with the same mechanical precision, forcing steel through flesh, 
bone, and cartilage. The coroner tallied fifty-one stab wounds on the Pole, 
plus thirteen blows to the head and two bullet wounds. 

Atkins had remained in the house with Tate, who was whimpering, sitting 
on the floor—still in only lingerie, and still bound by the neck to the dead 
body of her former lover, Sebring. She was the only one still alive. She was 
due to give birth to the child, a boy, in two weeks. Watson came back inside 
and ordered Atkins to kill her. Tate begged her to spare her life, to spare her 
unborn child. “I want to have my baby,” she said. 

“Woman, I have no mercy for you,” Atkins responded, locking her arm 
around Tate’s neck from behind. “You’re going to die, and I don’t feel 
anything about it.” She stabbed her in the stomach. Watson joined in. The 
pair stabbed her sixteen times until she cried out for her mother and died. 

Atkins dipped her fingers into one of Tate’s wounds and tasted her blood. 
It was “warm, sticky, and nice,” she’d recall later. “To taste death and yet 
give life,” she said, “wow, what a trick.” She soaked a towel in Tate’s blood 


and brought it to the front door, where, following Watson’s instruction to 
“write something that would shock the world,” she scrawled the word “Pig.” 
Their work was done. 


When Watson, Atkins, Krenwinkel, and Kasabian returned to the Spahn 
Ranch early that morning, they went to their beds and slept soundly. “I was 
gone,” Atkins later recalled. “It was like I was dead. I could not think about 
anything. It was almost as if I passed out, blacked out... My head was blank. 
There was nothing in me. It was like I had given it all.” 

At 10050 Cielo Drive was a scene of such callous, barbarous devastation 
that it shook something loose in the national psyche. August 8, 1969, and 
August 9, 1969, suddenly seemed to describe different realities. Media 
accounts were quick to infer something more sordid than ordinary homicide, 
something occult. One paper called the murders a “blood orgy”; others 
reported “ritualistic slayings” and “overtones of a weird religious rite.” The 
facts were unavailable or misreported. Maybe drugs were involved, maybe 
they weren’t; maybe Sebring had been wearing the black hood of a Satanist, 
maybe he hadn’t. The big picture was one of supernatural ruin. An officer at 
the scene said the bodies looked like mannequins dipped in red paint. 
Another said, “It’s like a battlefield up there.” Pools of blood had soaked into 
the carpets. According to Time magazine, stray bullets were lodged in the 
ceiling. 

In Roman Polanski, whose films were arrantly, even proudly occultist, the 
public found someone onto whom it could project its fatalism. A popular 
press account said that, mere minutes before he learned of the murders, 
Polanski, at a party in London, had been discussing a friend’s death. “Eeny 
meeny miney mo,” he said, “who will be the next to go?” With that, the 
phone rang, and he was summoned to hear that his wife and friends had been 
brutally murdered. 


It wasn’t over. The next night at the Spahn Ranch, the same group convened, 
with three additions. There was the eighteen-year-old Steven “Clem” Grogan, 
a musician and high school dropout, and the nineteen-year-old Leslie “Lu- 
Lu” Van Houten, a former homecoming princess from Orange County who’d 
played the sousaphone in junior high. 


And there was Charles Manson. Their leader. 

The seven of them piled into the beat-up Ford on a search for more 
victims. After nearly three hours of restive driving through Los Angeles and 
its environs, Manson finally settled on a home in Los Feliz, at 3301 Waverly 
Drive, next door to a house he’d once stayed in. With no idea of who lived 
there, he broke into the house by himself, armed with a pistol and a knife. 
Others maintain that he brought Tex Watson with him. In any case, he 
spotted Leno LaBianca, forty-four, a grocery store owner, asleep on the 
couch, a newspaper over his face. Leno’s wife, Rosemary, thirty-eight, was in 
the bedroom. Rosemary was paranoid that people had been breaking in and 
moving their furniture around lately—and, like the whole city, she was 
spooked by the Tate murders the previous night. Even so, Manson was 
apparently able to walk right in the front door, and he tied up the couple by 
himself. Then he rejoined his acolytes at the bottom of the long driveway, 
where they were waiting in the car. 

Manson chose Watson and Krenwinkel, again, as his executioners. This 
time he added Van Houten to the mix. She’d never so much as struck another 
person before that night. He told the three of them to go inside and kill 
everyone. They had only buck knives. 

They burst into the house, separated the couple, and stabbed Leno twenty- 
six times; they cut the word “War” into his stomach and impaled a carving 
fork beside it, its handle jutting out of his belly. They left a steak knife 
protruding from his throat. Rosemary suffered forty-one stab wounds, many 
inflicted after she’d died. Before they left, the killers scrawled “Healter [sic] 
Skelter” in blood on the refrigerator—misspelling the Beatles song “Helter 
Skelter.” On the walls, they smeared “Rise” and “Death to Pigs” in Leno’s 
blood. 


“Almost Dead Inside” 


The bloodshed, in its primitive defiance—a pregnant star slaughtered, a man 
perforated with kitchen utensils—confirmed a sense of rupture in America. 
The decade’s subversive spirit had come on with too much fervor. Some 
reckoning was bound to come, or so it seemed in retrospect; the latent 
violence couldn’t contain itself forever. 


The nation was immured in these events: in the motive, the manhunt, and 
then, in 1970, the sensational nine-and-a-half-month-long trial. But Manson 
and his cohort weren’t brought to justice for nearly four months. With the 
suspects unknown and at large, rumors proliferated and the tension reached a 
fever pitch. For a while, the police maintained that the two sets of murders 
were unrelated; the LaBiancas were victims of a copycat attack. Even 
Truman Capote, whose In Cold Blood was only a few years old, fell into the 
speculative fervor, appearing on The Tonight Show to provide a “fantasy” 
explanation of the murders. He blamed them on one person, with the motive a 
fit of rage and a heaping portion of paranoia. 

As days turned into weeks and weeks to months, two separate teams of 
LAPD detectives—one assigned to Tate, the other to LaBianca—failed to 
share information, believing the crimes unconnected. As they lost valuable 
time pursuing false leads, doubt and ridicule followed them in the press. For 
almost four months, the police would say that they had no real idea who had 
committed some of the most appalling murders in the history of the country. 

Talk about the murders long enough, and inevitably someone will bring 
up Joan Didion’s famous remark from The White Album: “The sixties ended 
abruptly on August 9, 1969... The tension broke that day. The paranoia was 
fulfilled.” There’s the germ of truth in that. But the process wasn’t so abrupt. 
It began that day, but it wasn’t over, really, until December 1, 1969, when the 
police announced the crimes had been solved and the nation got its first 
glimpse of the killers. Here was the final fulfillment of paranoia, the last gasp 
of sixties idealism. 

At LAPD headquarters, the chief of police, Edward M. Davis, stepped up 
to an array of fifteen microphones and announced to a stunned crowd of two 
hundred reporters that the case was solved. Warrants were out for Charles 
Watson, Patricia Krenwinkel, and Linda Kasabian. More people would be 
named pending grand jury indictments. Davis added, to everyone’s 
astonishment, that the Tate and LaBianca murders were connected. The 
suspects may have been responsible for a series of other unsolved homicides, 
too. 

He didn’t name Manson or Susan Atkins that day because they were 
already in custody. In mid-October, Manson, with a welter of his followers, 
had been apprehended on auto-theft charges at the Barker Ranch, a hideaway 
in forbidding Death Valley; its seclusion surpassed even that of the Spahn 


Ranch. Atkins had been charged with another, unrelated murder—that of 
Gary Hinman, an old friend of Manson—and was being held at the Sybil 
Brand Institute, a jail for women in Los Angeles County, where she bragged 
to cellmates about her complicity in the Tate murders. Those offhand remarks 
broke the case open for the LAPD, who began to connect the dots they’d 
been staring at for nearly four months. 

Journalists dug into the story. Images and mug shots of Manson and the 
Family were emblazoned on front pages and TV screens around the world. 
The cognitive dissonance was intense. These weren’t the faces of hardened 
criminals or escaped lunatics. They were hippies, stereotypical flower 
children, in the bloom of wide-eyed youth: the men unshaven and long- 
haired, wearing beads and buckskin jackets; the women in blue jeans and tie- 
dyed tops, no bras, their hair tangled and unwashed. 

They talked like hippies, too, spouting an ethos of free love, eschewing 
monogamy and marriage in favor of sexual experimentation. They lived in 
roving communes, caravanning along the Golden Coast in Technicolor-bright 
buses and clunkers cobbled together from spare parts. They believed that 
hallucinogens strengthened the spirit and expanded the mind. They gave birth 
naturally and raised their children together in rustic simplicity. 

In other ways, though, their philosophy was gnostic, verging on 
theological. Time did not exist, they proclaimed. There was no good, no bad, 
and no death. All human beings were God and the devil at the same time, and 
part of one another. In fact, everything in the universe was unified, one with 
itself. The Family’s moral code, insofar as it existed at all, was riven with 
contradictions. While it was wrong to kill animals—even the snakes and 
spiders in their bunkhouses had to be carefully spared—it was fine to kill 
people, because a human life was inherently valueless. To kill someone was 
tantamount to “breaking off a minute piece of some cosmic cookie,” as Tex 
Watson later put it. If anything, death was something to be embraced, 
because it exposed your soul to the oneness of the universe. 

Where had these beliefs come from? The murderers had been raised and 
educated in solid, conventional American communities, but no one wanted to 
claim them. The Family, with its starry-eyed communalism, sexual frankness, 
and veneration of LSD, offered a screen onto which anyone could project his 
insecurities about the era’s politics and pressures. The promise of the hippie 
movement had been in its willingness to forgo cherished institutions in favor 


of the new and untested. After the Tate murders, it seemed that hippies and 
freaks were more than a risible sideshow: they could really undermine the 
status quo. Their promiscuity had always earned a lot of finger wagging from 
concerned moralists, while others had looked on with thinly veiled envy. 
Parents were worried that their kids would drop out, become hippies, and 
never get decent jobs. Everywhere, kids were hitchhiking. The consensus 
from the straight world was that hippies were mostly harmless—but you 
didn’t want to be one. While there had been isolated incidents of violence 
attributed to hippies, none of it was as horrific, premeditated, and systematic 
as the murders committed by Manson’s Family. And so much about the 
crimes was mired in uncertainty, from the motive to the body count. By some 
estimates, over that four-month period in 1969, as many as thirty-three people 
may have been killed simply because one man ordered it. This was something 
altogether different. 

On December 12, with the nation still reeling from the indictments, a 
piece in Time magazine drew specious parallels between hippies and 
violence. In the movement’s “invitation to freedom,” the magazine warned, 
“criminals and psychotics” blossomed as easily as innocents and pacifists did. 
But how, Time asked, could “children who had dropped out for the sake of 
kindness and caring, love and beauty, be enjoined to kill”? Dr. Lewis 
Yablonsky, a sociologist who’d written a book called The Hippie Trip, 
argued that many hippies were “lonely, alienated people”: 


Even when they act as if they love, they can be totally devoid of true 
compassion. That is the reason why they can kill so matter-of-factly... 
Many hippies are socially almost dead inside. Some require massive 
emotions to feel anything at all. They need bizarre, intensive acts to 
feel alive—sexual acts, acts of violence, nudity, every kind of 
Dionysian thrill. 


“The Mechanical Boy” 


And this Charles Milles Manson, whose face was suddenly everywhere—was 
he not the epitome of the Dionysian thrill seeker? A thirty-five-year-old ex- 
con, roughly half his life whiled away in federal institutions, had ensnared the 


lives and minds of his followers, mainly young women. Numbering variously 
between two to three dozen, the majority of the Family members had been 
under Manson’s influence for less than two years, some not even close to 
that. Yet all of them would do anything Manson asked, without question, 
including slaughtering complete strangers. He had cultivated extreme 
compliance. 

Manson was an unlikely candidate for a charismatic leader. Born in 
Cincinnati, Ohio, to a sixteen-year-old mother and a father he never met, he’d 
known little but privation and suffering. Few would be naturally inclined to 
look up to him, and in the most literal sense, not many could: he was only 
five foot six. 

Manson spent his earliest years in neglect. When he was still an infant, his 
mother would leave him to go on benders with her brother, during one of 
which the pair decided to rob a guy who looked wealthy. Within hours, 
they’d been arrested, and Manson’s mother was imprisoned for several years. 
He was eight when she was released, and they spent the next months with a 
succession of unreliable men in seamy locales, his mom racking up another 
arrest for grand larceny. Eventually, she pursued a traveling salesman in 
Indianapolis, marrying him in 1943 and trying to cut back on her drinking. 
Manson, not yet nine, was already a truant, known to steal from local shops. 
His mother looked for a foster home for him. Instead, he was made a ward of 
the state and sent to the Gibault School for Boys, a Catholic-run school for 
delinquents in Terre Haute, Indiana. He ran away. His mother took him back. 
The separation must have weighed on him, at least to go by his acolyte 
Watson, who later wrote that Manson had “a special hatred for women as 
mothers... This probably had something to do with his feelings about his own 
mother, though he never talked about her... The closest he came to breaking 
his silence was in some of his song lyrics: ‘I am a mechanical boy, I am my 
mother’s boy.’” 

The “mechanical boy” made short work of the Gibault School. Ten 
months in, he ran away again, turning to burglary to keep himself afloat. His 
crimes soon landed him in a correctional facility in Omaha, Nebraska. He ran 
away from there, too, and started breaking into grocery stores. At age 
thirteen, Manson was sent to the Indiana Boys School, a tougher institution, 
where he claimed the other boys raped him. He learned to feign lunacy to 
keep them at bay. And he kept running away: eighteen times in three years. 


In February 1951, when he was sixteen, Manson broke out again, this time 
with a pair of other boys. They drove a stolen car across state lines—a federal 
offense. When a roadblock in Utah brought their escapade to an end, Manson 
was sent to the National Training School for Boys, in Washington, D.C. Thus 
began a long stint in the federal reformatory system. From there, Manson 
went to the Natural Bridge Honor Camp, where he was caught raping a boy at 
knifepoint; to a federal reformatory in Virginia, where he racked up similar 
offenses; and to a reformatory in Ohio, where a run of good behavior earned 
him an early release in 1954, though caseworkers had taken frequent note of 
his antisocial behavior and psychic trauma. 

In less than a year’s time he had a wife, and a baby on the way. He took 
on various service jobs, but he couldn’t give up stealing cars, several of 
which he drove, again, across state lines. Those crimes, plus his failure to 
attend a hearing related to one of them, netted him a three-year sentence to 
Terminal Island, a federal prison in San Pedro, California. By the time he got 
out, in 1958, his wife had filed for divorce, and he turned to pimping to make 
a living. The following May, he was arrested yet again, this time for forging a 
government check for $37.50. This got him another ten-year sentence, but the 
judge, moved by the plea of a woman who said she was in love with him and 
wanted to marry him, suspended the sentence right away, letting him go free. 

Manson kept pimping, stealing cars, and scheming people out of their 
money. The FBI was surveilling him, hoping to bust him for violating the 
Mann Act, which forbade the transportation of prostitutes across state lines. 
They were never able to bring the charge, but when Manson disappeared to 
Mexico with another prostitute, he was found in violation of his probation, 
and the ten-year sentence he’d received earlier was brought into effect. The 
same judge who’d granted him probation now decreed: “If there ever was a 
man who demonstrated himself completely unfit for probation, he is it.” 

Stuck in prison for the long haul, Manson took up the guitar and dabbled 
in Scientology. The staff noted his gift for charismatic storytelling and his 
enduring “personality problems.” He made no secret of his musical 
aspirations. From behind bars, he observed, with great interest and envy, the 
meteoric rise of the Beatles. 

When he was released at age thirty-two, he’d spent more than half his life 
in the care of the state. He preferred life in prison, he said, so much so that he 
asked if he could simply remain inside. “He has no plans for release,” one 


report said, “as he says he has nowhere to go.” 


“Bloodthirsty Robots” 


Reading early press accounts of Manson and the Family, I found it hard to 
separate hyperbole from veracity. Manson was often made out as an artful 
seeker—‘“an evil Pied Piper,” as one paper put it, with reserves of obscure 
power. About a week after the Family’s arrests, a photograph of a wild-eyed 
Charles Manson, looking for all the world like a modern-day Rasputin, 
appeared on the cover of Life magazine. Inside the issue, the “Manson 
women,” many of them barely teenagers, posed with babies slung over their 
slender shoulders. They spoke of their love and undying support for 
“Charlie,” whom they deemed the second coming of Christ and Satan in one. 

The media had already started to label the Family “a nomadic band of 
hippies” and a “pseudo-religious cult”; the New York Times, striking a 
dramatic note, claimed that they “lived a life of indolence, free sex, midnight 
motorcycle races and blind obedience to a mysterious guru inflamed with his 
power to control their minds and bodies.” 

The underground press, though, had a swell of sympathy for Manson. 
People thought he was innocent, that his status as a left-leaning communard 
had been overblown. Tuesday’s Child, an L.A. counterculture paper geared 
toward occultists, named Manson their “man of the year.” Some didn’t even 
care if he was behind the murders. Bernardine Dohrn, of the Weather 
Underground, put it most outrageously: “Offing those rich pigs with their 
own forks and knives, and then eating a meal in the same room, far out! The 
Weathermen dig Charles Manson.” 

I watched the first television footage of Manson. Cameras followed as 
bailiffs led him to a pretrial hearing, shackled, stooped, and glaring. I saw 
few traces of his fabled charisma, but I understood how his unsocialized air 
of pseudomysticism and jailhouse aggression seemed authentic. Manson 
brought a rollicking exhibition of controlled insanity whenever he appeared 
before the bench. He quarreled with the judge, arguing that he should be 
allowed to represent himself. The “girls,” for their part, mimicked their 
leader’s behavior, publicly battling the judge and their court-appointed 
defense attorneys at every opportunity and refusing to obey even the most 


fundamental rules of courtroom decorum. 

That Manson had been apprehended in Death Valley—as abyssal a place 
as any in the United States—made him all the more transfixing. Reporters 
played up the Rasputin comparison, emphasizing his desert-wanderer 
sorcery. He was a “bearded, demonic Mahdi,” wrote one journalist, who led 
“a mystical, semi-religious hippie drug-and-murder cult.” Another described 
him as a “bushy-haired, wild-bearded little man with piercing brown eyes,” 
with the Family “a hippie-type roving band.” Manson’s malevolence was 
seemingly inexplicable. Even in the doodles that he left behind on a 
courtroom legal pad, psychiatrists saw “a psyche torn asunder by powerful 
thrusts of aggression, guilt, and hostility.” 

Beneath this spectacle, I could glimpse the public’s truer, more profound 
interest in the case, the same puzzle that would consume me: How and why 
had these people devolved into criminals? And, more pointedly, could it 
happen to any average American child—could anyone go “too far”? 

The trial started in July 1970. The jury was sequestered at the Ambassador 
Hotel, where, two years earlier, Bobby Kennedy had been assassinated. The 
Superior Courthouse in downtown Los Angeles became the center of a media 
circus unlike any the nation had ever seen. The six defendants—Charles 
Manson, Patricia Krenwinkel, Susan Atkins, Leslie Van Houten, Steve 
Grogan, and Linda Kasabian—received the kind of scrutiny known only to 
the most famous celebrities in the world. (Tex Watson was tried separately 
from the other Family members; he’d fled to Texas and had to be extradited 
to California.) 

Vincent Bugliosi became the public face of the state, and Manson’s de 
facto foil. Though you’d never know it to look at them, the two were the 
Same age—Manson was actually Bugliosi’s senior by three months. Both 
were thirty-five when the trial began. But Bugliosi, with his three-piece suits 
and his receding hairline, was the very picture of the straight world, with its 
authority and moral gravity; sometimes he looked old enough to be Manson’s 
dad. 

In Helter Skelter, Bugliosi claims an aversion to “the stereotyped image of 
the prosecutor” as “a right-wing, law-and-order type intent on winning 
convictions at any cost.” But that’s exactly how he came across. In file 
photographs he’s often haloed in microphones, his solemn pronouncements 
helping the world make sense of the senseless. Journalists lauded his “even- 


toned arguments.” 

With his opening statement, Bugliosi, no less colorful a character than 
Manson, made what was already a sensational case even more so. The motive 
he presented for the murders was spellbindingly bizarre. In Bugliosi’s telling, 
it crossed racism with apocalyptic, biblical rhetoric, all of it set to a melody 
by the Beatles—“the English musical recording group,” as he primly referred 
to them: 


Manson was an avid follower of the Beatles and believed that they 
were speaking to him through the lyrics of their songs... “Helter 
Skelter,” the title of one of the Beatles’ songs, meant the black man 
rising up against the white establishment and murdering the entire 
white race, that is, with the exception of Manson and his chosen 
followers, who intended to “escape” from Helter Skelter by going to 
the desert and living in the Bottomless Pit, a place Manson derived 
from Revelation 9. 


Nothing like this had ever been heard in a courtroom. People kill one another 
for all kinds of reasons, but they’re usually personal, not metaphysical. 
Seldom had threads like these—racism, rock music, the end times—been 
woven together in a single, lethal philosophy. When Paul Watkins, a former 
Family member, took the stand to elaborate on Helter Skelter, the details 
were even more jarring. Watkins spoke of “a big underground city,” secreted 
away in a hole wide enough that “you could drive a speedboat across it.” 
From the book of Revelation, the Family knew the city would have no sun 
and no moon, and “a tree that bears twelve different kinds of fruit.” 
Subsisting on that fruit in their subterranean Elysium, the Family would 
multiply into 144,000 people. 

As insane and illogical as it sounded, Bugliosi explained, Manson’s 
followers subscribed to his prophecy of Armageddon as if it’d been delivered 
from the Holy Mount. They were willing to kill for him to make it a reality. 

But none of this explained why Manson had chosen the Tate and 
LaBianca homes as his targets. Manson had known the former tenant at the 
Tate house, Terry Melcher, a record producer and the son of Doris Day. 
Melcher had flirted with the idea of recording Manson, who had dreams of 


rock stardom, but he decided against it. Sometime in the spring before the 
murders, Manson had gone looking for Melcher at the house, hoping to 
change his mind, but a friend of the new tenants told him that Melcher had 
moved out. Manson didn’t like the guy’s brusque attitude. Consequently, the 
house on Cielo Drive came to represent the “establishment” that had rejected 
him. When he ordered the killings, he wanted to “instill fear in Terry 
Melcher,” Susan Atkins had said, sending a clear signal to the stars and 
executives who’d snubbed him. As for the LaBianca house: Manson had once 
stayed in the place next door. That house was no longer occupied, but it was 
no matter. The neighbors, Manson decided, would suffice as targets, because 
they, too, no matter who they were, symbolized the establishment he sought 
to overthrow with Helter Skelter. 

The trial was the longest and most expensive in U.S. history at the time. It 
wasn’t as straightforward as it might seem, because Manson himself hadn’t 
actually murdered anyone. He hadn’t set foot in the Tate home at all, and 
though he’d entered the LaBianca home, he left before his followers killed 
the couple. That meant Manson could be convicted of first-degree murder 
only through a charge of conspiracy. According to the legal principle of 
vicarious liability, any conspirator was also guilty of the crimes committed 
by his coconspirators. In other words, if the prosecution could prove that 
Manson had ordered the killings, he would be guilty of murder, even having 
not laid a finger on any of the victims. Bugliosi had to show that Manson had 
a unique ability to control his followers’ thoughts and actions—that they 
would do whatever he asked, even kill complete strangers. 

It would have been a complicated case even had things proceeded 
smoothly. But the Family did all they could to throw sand in the gears. On the 
very first day of the trial, Manson showed up at the courthouse with an X 
carved into his forehead, the wound so fresh it was still bleeding. The next 
day, Atkins, Krenwinkel, and Van Houten arrived with their own bloody Xs. 
The women skipped down the courtroom hallways, three abreast, holding 
hands, singing nursery rhymes that Manson had written. They laughed at the 
photographers who jostled to get their pictures. During the trial, if Manson 
took umbrage at something, they took umbrage, too, mimicking his profanity, 
his expressions, his outbursts. 

The judge, Charles Older, would often threaten to remove Manson. On 
one occasion, Manson returned the reproach: “I will have you removed if you 


don’t stop. I have a little system of my own... Do you think I’m kidding?” 
Grabbing a sharp pencil, he sprang over the defense table, flinging himself 
toward Older. A bailiff intervened and tackled him, and the girls jumped to 
their feet, too, chanting unintelligible verses in Latin. As he was dragged 
from the courtroom, Manson remained defiant, shouting, “In the name of 
Christian justice, someone should cut your head off!” It was a glimpse of the 
raw pugilism that ran beneath Manson’s philosopher-guru facade. The judge 
began to carry a .38 revolver under his robes. 

Things were no more orderly outside the courtroom, where, at the corner 
of Temple and Grand, members of the Family gathered each morning to hold 
sidewalk vigils. Barefoot and belligerent, they sat in wide circles, singing 
songs in praise of their leader. The women suckled newborns. The men 
laughed and ran their fingers through their long, unwashed hair. All had 
followed Manson’s lead and cut Xs into their foreheads, distributing 
typewritten statements explaining that the self-mutilation symbolized their 
“X-ing” themselves “out of society.” 

Bugliosi called the defendants “bloodthirsty robots”’—a grandiloquent 
phrase, but an apt one. It captured the unsettling duality of the killers: at once 
animal and artificial, divorced from emotion and yet capable of executing the 
most intimate, visceral form of murder imaginable. Tex Watson would later 
hymn the detached, automated ecstasy of stabbing: “Over and over, again and 
again, my arm like a machine, at one with the blade.” Susan Atkins told a 
cellmate that plunging the knife into Tate’s pregnant belly was “like a sexual 
release. Especially when you see the blood spurting out. It’s better than a 
climax.” And behind them was Manson, who lived for sex even as he 
described himself as “the mechanical boy.” 


“A Stage of Nothing” 


After seven grueling months, the first phase of the trial drew to a close, and 
the jury, after ten days of deliberation, arrived at unanimous guilty verdicts. 
Now, in the second phase, the prosecution had to present an argument for 
putting the defendants to death. Their case, and the defense’s 
counterarguments, led to some of the most unnerving testimony yet, 
including a kind of symposium on LSD—not as a recreational drug, but as an 


agent of mind control. This death-penalty phase of the trial entertained some 
of the same questions that engrossed and vexed me for the next two decades. 
Had Manson really “brainwashed” people? If so, how? And if one person was 
truly under the psychological control of another, then who was responsible 
for that person’s actions? 

For the first time, the three convicted women—Atkins, Krenwinkel, and 
Van Houten—took the witness stand. One by one, they explained their roles 
in the murders, absolving Manson of any complicity and proclaiming their 
utter lack of remorse. The families of the victims looked on in stunned 
silence as the women described their loved ones’ final moments in clinical 
detail. To kill someone, the women explained, was an act of love—it freed 
that person from the confines of their physical being. 

Almost unblinkingly, Susan Atkins recalled how Tex Watson had told her 
to murder Tate: “He looked at her and he said, ‘Kill her.” And I killed her... I 
just stabbed her and she fell, and I stabbed her again. I don’t know how many 
times I stabbed her.” Did she feel animosity toward Tate or the others? She 
shrugged. “I didn’t know any of them. How could I have felt any emotion 
without knowing them?” She knew that what she was doing “was right,” she 
added, “because it felt good.” 

Patricia Krenwinkel said she’d felt nothing when she stabbed Abigail 
Folger twenty-eight times. “What is there to describe? It was just there, and 
it’s like it was right.” Why would she kill a woman she didn’t even know? 
“Well, it’s hard to explain. It was just a thought and the thought came to be.” 

““Sorry’ is only a five-letter word,” Leslie Van Houten told the 
courtroom. “It can’t bring back anything.” She’d helped stab Rosemary 
LaBianca forty-one times. “What can I feel?” Van Houten said. “It has 
happened. She is gone.” 

As unrepentant as the women were, Bugliosi had his work cut out for him 
when it came to securing the death penalty. His reasoning relied on a seeming 
contradiction. He’d argued during the first phase of the trial that the women 
were “brainwashed zombies,” totally in Manson’s thrall. Now he had to 
prove the opposite: that they were as complicit as Manson was. Although 
they were “automatons,” Bugliosi said, “slavishly obedient to Manson’s 
every command,” the women still had, “deep down inside themselves,” such 
“bloodlust” that they deserved the death penalty. 

The defense argued that the women were merely pawns. Manson had used 


an almost technologically precise combination of drugs, hypnotism, and 
coercion to transform these formerly nonviolent people into frenzied, 
psychopathic killers. At that point, scientists in the United States had been 
studying LSD for only a little more than a decade—it was far from a known 
quantity. Manson, the defense said, had used the drug to ply his 
impressionable followers, accessing the innermost chambers of their minds 
and molding them to his designs. 

Former members of the Family have often recounted Manson’s systematic 
“brainwashing” methods, beginning with the seduction of new recruits by 
“bombarding” them with love, sex, and drugs. On the witness stand, Paul 
Watkins outlined the near weekly orgies that Manson orchestrated at the 
Spahn Ranch. The leader would hand out drugs, personally deciding 
everyone’s dosages. And then, as Bugliosi writes in Helter Skelter, 


Charlie might dance around, everyone else following, like a train. As 
he’d take off his clothes, all the rest would take off their clothes... 
Charlie would direct the orgy, arranging bodies, combinations, 
positions. “He’d set it all up in a beautiful way like he was creating a 
masterpiece in sculpture,” Watkins said, “but instead of clay he was 
using warm bodies.” 


If any of those bodies had “hang-ups” or inhibitions, Manson would 
eliminate them. He’d force someone to do whatever he or she most resisted 
doing. “One thirteen-year-old girl’s initiation into the Family consisted of her 
being sodomized by Manson while the others watched,” Bugliosi wrote. 
“Manson also ‘went down on’ a young boy to show the others he had rid 
himself of all inhibitions.” 

Tex Watson, in his 1978 memoir Will You Die for Me?, tells a similar 
story. “There was a room in the back of the ranch house totally lined with 
mattresses,” he wrote, essentially set aside for sex. “As we had any 
inhibitions we still weren’t dead, we were still playing back what our parents 
had programmed into us.” 

Having made them feel freed and wanted, Manson would isolate his 
followers from the world beyond the ranch, giving them daily tasks to 
support the commune and forbidding them from communicating with their 


families or friends. His was a world without newspapers, clocks, or calendars. 
Manson chose new names for his initiates. “In order for me to be completely 
free in my mind I had to be able to completely forget the past,” Susan Atkins 
testified. “The easiest way to do this is to have to change identity.” 

Their induction was complete after they participated in lengthy LSD 
sessions—often stretching over consecutive days, with no breaks—during 
which Manson only pretended to take the drug, or took a much smaller dose. 
Clearheaded, he manipulated their minds with elaborate word games and 
sensory techniques he’d developed in the two years since his release from 
prison. With only negligible downtime between acid trips, detachment was 
all the easier. Every experience led the Family to drift further from reality 
until, eventually, even basic contradictions seemed tenable: death was the 
same as life, good was no different from bad, and God was inseparable from 
Satan. 

Paul Watkins believed that Manson wanted to use LSD “to instill his 
philosophies, exploit weaknesses and fears, and extract promises and 
agreements from his followers.” And it worked. Watkins recalled an instance 
in which Manson told Susan Atkins, “I’d like half a coconut, even if you 
have to go to Rio de Janeiro to get it.” Atkins “got right up and was on her 
way out the door when Charlie said, ‘Never mind.’” Manson excelled, 
Watkins said, at “locating deep-seated hang-ups.” He “took up residence in 
people’s heads,” leaving them with “no point of reference, nothing to relate 
back to, no right, no wrong—no roots.” They lived in a “new reality” 
summoned by LSD, which left them “melt-twisted and free of pretension in 
timeless spirals of movement.” 

Ironically, as his followers became more and more robotic, Manson taught 
them that people in the straight world “were like computers,” the Family’s 
Brooks Poston wrote. Their worldviews were simply a matter of society’s 
programming, and any program could be expunged. On the stand, Susan 
Atkins described Sharon Tate as an “IBM machine—words came out of her 
mouth but they didn’t make any sense to me.” 

For a Family novitiate, the goal was to burn yourself out, to take so much 
LSD and listen to so much of Charlie’s music that you returned “to a purity 
and nothingness” resembling a new birth, Tex Watson wrote. This was called 
going “dead in the head,” and it let you incorporate into the collective, 
sharing “one common brain.” 


Bugliosi had to use a little prosecutorial hocus-pocus to tell stories like 
these. He argued that the Manson women had been psychologically 
compromised, but he didn’t assert that Manson had actually created his 
killers. Despite Manson’s talk about “reprogramming,” there was no template 
for one person’s ever having done such a thing to another. Instead, Bugliosi 
purported that Manson’s followers must have had some preexisting homicidal 
impulse buried in their subconsciouses. Manson had learned to recognize and 
exploit that impulse, but even so, each woman was responsible for her 
actions. Then as now, this position fascinated and perplexed me: it posited a 
form of brainwashing in which the brainwashed were still, to some degree, 
“themselves.” 

When it came time to decide on the death penalty, though, the defense 
called a series of psychiatric experts who disagreed. Manson had 
brainwashed his followers, they said, and those followers couldn’t be 
culpable for the murders. LSD had given him a portal to the most labile parts 
of the subconscious. The scientists explained how acid could break down and 
reconstruct someone’s personality—how a sober “guide,” intended to lead 
someone peacefully through the many hours of an acid trip, could abuse the 
role, inserting violent ideals and beliefs into their minds. With repetition and 
reinforcement, these beliefs took root and flourished even when the followers 
were sober. Throw in other coercive techniques like sensory deprivation and 
hypnosis—both of which Manson embraced—and it was possible to rewrite 
someone’s moral code such that she acknowledged no such thing as right or 
wrong. 

Dr. Joel Fort, a research psychiatrist who’d opened the nation’s first LSD 
treatment center, was one of the defense witnesses. He believed that Manson 
had used LSD to produce “a new pattern of behavior for the girls,” resulting 
in “a totally neutral system which saw death or killing in a completely 
different way than a normal person sees it,” free of “social concern, 
compassion, [and] moral values.” 

In one of the most remarkable exchanges in the trial, Manson’s attorney, 
Irving Kanarek, asked Dr. Fort if “a school for crime” could exist, peopled 
with social rejects and fueled by LSD: “Let us say with your knowledge of 
LSD, you have a school for crime, and then you take them here and you 
program them to go out and commit a murder here, there, everywhere... Are 
you telling us that this can be done, that you can capture the human mind by 


such a school for crime?” 

“I am indeed telling you that,” Fort said. And he’d never seen anything 
like it. He compared it to a government’s ability, through the nebulous 
powers of patriotism, to condition soldiers to kill on its behalf. 

What no one brought up was how someone like Manson, with little formal 
education and so much prison time under his belt, had mastered the ability to 
control people this way. Whether you thought it was full-on brainwashing or 
merely intense coercion, the fact remained: He’d done it. No one else had. 
This remains the most enduring mystery of the case. It’s the one that still 
keeps me up at night. And while all this back-and-forth about LSD is 
provocative, it feels like an insufficient explanation. 

In Helter Skelter, Bugliosi grapples with this unfathomable riddle: How 
did Charles Manson, a barely literate ex-con who’d spent more than half his 
life in federal institutions, turn a group of previously peaceful hippies— 
among them a small-town librarian, a high school football star, and a 
homecoming princess—into savage, unrepentant killers, in less than a year? 
Bugliosi conceded that he still didn’t have the answer. “All these factors 
contributed to Manson’s control over others,” he writes, 


but when you add them all up, do they equal murder without remorse? 
Maybe, but I tend to think there is something more, some missing link 
that enabled him to so rape and bastardize the minds of his killers that 
they would go against the most ingrained of all commandments, Thou 
shalt not kill, and willingly, even eagerly, murder at his command. 

It may be something in his charismatic, enigmatic personality, 
some intangible quality that no one else has yet been able to isolate 
and identify. It may be something that he learned from others. 
Whatever it is, I believe Manson has full knowledge of the formula he 
used. And it worries me that we do not. 


In the end, Manson and his followers got the death penalty anyway. Bugliosi 
said that they had, “coursing through their veins,” the willingness to kill 
others. For the jury, as for the public, that was a much more comfortable 
truth: these people were an aberration. Brainwashing, complete loss of 
agency—these were difficult to contemplate, let alone to accept. 


“When you take LSD enough times you reach a stage of nothing,” 
Manson had said in court. “You reach a stage of no thought.” No one wanted 
to dwell on that. Ingrained evil, teased out of young women by a mastermind 
—that was something. And something was better than “a stage of nothing.” 

When the jury delivered death sentences to the four defendants—Manson, 
Krenwinkel, Atkins, and Van Houten; Kasabian had become a witness for the 
prosecution and was granted immunity—the three women sprang to their 
feet. Their heads were freshly shaved, as Manson’s was. They’d enlarged the 
Xs on their foreheads, as Manson had. And they were livid. 

“You have judged yourselves,” Patricia Krenwinkel screamed at the jury. 

“Better lock your doors and watch your own kids,” Susan Atkins warned. 

“Your whole system is a game,” Leslie Van Houten shouted. “You blind, 
stupid people. Your children will turn against you.” 

Out on the street, Sandy Good, one of Manson’s fiercest loyalists, looked 
into a TV camera and said, “Death? That’s what you’re all going to get.” 

With that, the Family was swept off the national stage, and the public 
could relegate these grisly crimes to the past. Seven people had been brutally 
murdered. But the nation was confident that we knew how and why, and that 
the evil people were behind bars.

An Aura of Danger 


“Live Freaky, Die Freaky” 


When I started interviews for my Premiere piece, in April 1999, much of 
what you’ve just read was unknown to me. I’d gotten through Helter Skelter, 
and I knew the murders had left a mark on Hollywood, but that was about all. 
In a few years I’d develop a deep obsession with the case; I’d have the trial 
transcript at my fingertips and binders full of press clippings at my disposal. 
But in the beginning, I was flummoxed. 

Helter Skelter had captured the story definitively. Its author had ensured 
that Manson was locked away. How could a magazine feature top that? 
Leslie, my editor, had given me leeway in finding an angle. But her first 
suggestion—how did the crimes change Hollywood?—wasn’t enough for me, 
and I suspected it wouldn’t be enough for her, either. 

My earliest weeks of interviews pulled me in wildly different directions. 
At first, I was compelled by the way the murders had sundered friendships in 
Hollywood, revealing strong opinions about the era’s morality, or lack 
thereof. As I cycled through Hollywood cliques, I found that I was reigniting 
thirty-year-old rumors and rivalries. Everyone, over time, assigned the blame 
for the crimes a little differently. I was dealing in memories that had survived 
decades of erosion. Even my most reliable sources were shaky on the details. 
As for the unreliable sources, I kept reminding myself that many of them 
were washed-up Hollywood personalities, often in their dotage. Their 
memories had warped to accommodate their bruised egos, their ulterior 
motives, and, above all, their sense that they were at the center of any story 


worth telling. 

A lot of the contradictions I heard centered on the house at Cielo Drive, 
and the decadent scene there in the months before the murders. That house 
still signified a lot in Hollywood. For some, the death of Sharon Tate and her 
friends aroused as much fear as it did grief. 

After the murders, the media had blamed Hollywood’s “unreality and 
hedonism,” as the New York Times’s Stephen Roberts put it, for having 
fostered an atmosphere where mass homicide was all but guaranteed. 
Roberts, then Los Angeles bureau chief of the Times, talked to a lot of 
Hollywood people in those first weeks. Bugliosi quoted him in Helter 
Skelter: “All the stories had a common thread: That somehow the victims had 
brought the murders on themselves... The attitude was summed up in the 
epigram: ‘Live freaky, die freaky.’” 

The problem was, thirty years later, no one could agree on who had 
brought the “freakiness” into the home, and why. I had to wonder if there was 
a conspiracy of silence in Hollywood. It had taken months for the LAPD to 
crack the case. In that time, Manson and the Family had almost certainly 
killed others. If Hollywood hadn’t circled the wagons, it seemed there was a 
good chance the investigation could have ended sooner. So many of the 
people I spoke to had strong ideas about why these murders had happened— 
and yet none of them had spoken to the police, and many remained unwilling 
to go on the record with me. 

The one thing everyone seemed to agree on—everyone outside of the 
DA’s office, that is—is that Bugliosi’s Helter Skelter motive didn’t add up. It 
had worn thin with police and Hollywood insiders, and it was wearing thin 
with me, too. I tried to unpack this idea that Manson chose the Cielo house to 
“instill fear” in Terry Melcher, the record producer whose rejection had 
apparently so enraged Manson that he activated a race war. 

One problem was that Melcher, by all accounts, had no idea that this was 
why the Family attacked his former home. They never told him that they 
wanted him to be afraid—they didn’t follow the murders with any kind of 
communication to him. According to Bugliosi, Melcher never realized the 
crimes had anything to do with him until months later, when the police got in 
touch with him. How was this motive supposed to work if Melcher was never 
apprised of it? 

The grander scheme underlying Helter Skelter—to start a massive race 


war by making it look as if Black Panthers were behind the murders—didn’t 
land, either. Although Manson was clearly a racist, and while he had a wild, 
eschatological philosophy, no one believed even for a second that black 
militants were behind these killings, as he’d hoped it would seem. 

So was the Family just too dumb, or too drugged, to pull it off? Or was 
there another reason for the murders that had nothing to do with race wars 
and scaring Melcher? It seemed to me that the Manson murders had garnered 
much of their infamy—and Bugliosi much of his fame—from the Helter 
Skelter motive. A hippie race war spawned by an_acid-drenched, 
brainwashing ex-con: it was such a fantastical conceit that the murders lived 
on in pop culture. With a more commonplace explanation—a drug burn, say, 
or Hollywood infighting—they would’ve faded into history after a few years, 
and Bugliosi would never have written the most popular true-crime book of 
all time. 

With an eye on other possible motives, I focused on three questions in my 
first weeks of reporting. First: Did the victims at the Tate house have 
something to do with the killers? 

Second: Had Terry Melcher known who the killers were immediately after 
the crimes, and failed to report them to the authorities? 

Third, and most sensationally: Were the police aware of Manson’s role in 
the crimes much earlier than it seemed—had they delayed arresting the 
Family to protect the victims, or Melcher and his circle, from scrutiny? 

Here, as neatly as I can tell it, is what I learned in the early, frantic weeks 
of my reporting. Just as important is what I didn’t leam—which goes a long 
way toward explaining how a simple three-month magazine assignment 
turned into a twenty-year obsession. 


“The Dancing Was Different” 


Julian Wasser, a photographer for Life magazine, was my first interview. 
Almost right away, I felt the kind of cognitive dissonance that followed me 
through my reporting. Pd meet my sources at a fancy restaurant of their 
choice—in this case, Le Petit Four, a sunny sidewalk café in West 
Hollywood—and, within minutes, as the conversation turned toward 
violence, the plush setting would feel totally incongruous. Such was the case 


with Wasser, who told me over a tuna niçoise salad about one of the saddest 
days of his life. 

Days after the murders, as part of an editorial for Life, Wasser had 
accompanied Roman Polanski on his first return visit to the house on Cielo 
Drive. One of Wasser’s pictures from that day is a study in grief. Polanski, in 
a white T-shirt, sits slumped and devastated on the front porch of his home, 
his eyes carefully averted from the faded word “Pig” written in his wife’s 
blood on the front door. 

“Tt was too soon,” Wasser told me. He’d shadowed Polanski as he moved 
through the bloodstained rooms. It wasn’t a home anymore; it was evidence. 
“There was fingerprint-dusting powder all over the bedroom and the phones, 
and there was blood in the carpet. It was thick like Jell-O.” And there was so 
much of it that it hadn’t even dried yet, Wasser said. “You could still smell 
it... Salty, carnal.” The odor reminded him of a slaughterhouse. 

Right away, Wasser regretted the assignment. But Polanski wanted him 
there, even at his most vulnerable moment. It wasn’t an exercise in vanity, at 
least not entirely. Hoping to help solve the murders, Polanski had invited 
along a psychic, Peter Hurkos, whose alleged clairvoyance had made him a 
minor celebrity. Wasser was enlisted to provide duplicates of his photos to 
Hurkos, who could glean “psychic vibrations” from them. 

Polanski led them to the nursery, which Tate had carefully furnished and 
decorated in anticipation of the baby. “Roman went over to the bassinet and 
just started crying. I said, “This is such a private moment, I shouldn’t be 
here,’ and he said, ‘Please, don’t take any more pictures right now.’ It was 
just the saddest thing I’ve ever seen in my whole career. I’ve never seen 
anything, in my mind, so intrusive, even though he had invited me... The 
enormity of it,’ Wasser added, “going into this pregnant woman’s bedroom 
and seeing her intimate area covered with fingerprint powder and realizing 
what happened there.” 

Hurkos, it turned out, didn’t share Wasser’s sense of solemnity. A week 
before the Life story ran, pirated reproductions of Wasser’s photos appeared 
on the front page of the tabloid the Hollywood Citizen News. The psychic had 
sold his copies, vibrations and all. 

Wasser described the “great fear” that descended on Los Angeles after the 
murders. “I lived in Beverly Hills. If you went to someone’s house they 
wouldn’t let you in. The normal selfishness and paranoia was magnified a 


hundredfold. It was another reason for not answering your door.” 


I heard a lot of that in my first interviews. Sales of burglar alarms and 
security systems had apparently soared after the murders, and people were 
quick to ditch their drug stashes. There’s a famous, anonymous line from 
Life, from the very article featuring Wasser’s pictures, actually: “Toilets are 
flushing all over Beverly Hills; the entire Los Angeles sewer system is 
stoned.” 

Others took more drastic precautions. At the funerals of his friends Tate 
and Sebring, Steve McQueen carried a pistol in his belt, his publicist Warren 
Cowan told me. The actor was in the throes of an anxiety that pervaded 
Hollywood, where everyone suspected that the killer might be among them. 
Dominick Dunne, the Vanity Fair journalist known for his reporting on the 
entertainment industry, told me, “Hollywood did change... The dancing was 
different. The drugs were different. The fucking was different.” He and his 
wife were so frightened that they sent their kids to stay with their 
grandmother in northern California. 

Tina Sinatra, Frank’s daughter, said that her father had hired a security 
guard. “He was there from sundown to sunrise for months,” she explained. 
“Mom fed him to death, I think. He was uniformed with a gun and he sat in 
the kitchen all night. I can remember the whole tone of this city afterward... 
it defined fear.” 

In 1999, apparently, that fear was still alive and well, at least among 
Hollywood’s A-list, many of whom declined to speak to me, even though 
thirty years had passed. I was rebuffed by the intimates of Tate, Polanski, and 
Sebring—sometimes with vehemence, sometimes with tersely worded emails 
or phone calls. “No interest.” “Doesn’t want to be involved.” Or just the one 
word: “No.” Warren Beatty and Jane Fonda said no. Jack Nicholson and 
Dennis Hopper, both reputedly close to Tate and Polanski: no, no. Candice 
Bergen, Terry Melcher’s girlfriend at the time of the murders, said no, too— 
as did David Geffen, Mia Farrow, and Anjelica Huston, among others. 

As the rejections piled up, I had my own bout of paranoia. Had some 
memo gone out? My request had asked simply if they’d like to discuss the 
aftereffects of the murders on their community; it didn’t feel like I was 
prying. And Premiere, since it was dedicated entirely to the movie business, 


usually garnered some enthusiasm from this crowd. Bruce Dern: no. Kirk 
Douglas: no. Paul Newman: no. Elliott Gould, Ann-Margret, Hugh Hefner: 
no, no, no. All told, more than three dozen people turned me down. Some 
were household names, but plenty of the decidedly nonfamous found reasons 
to decline, too. It was looking like I’d have a story about Hollywood with no 
one from Hollywood in it. 

Hoping for something more revelatory, I went to less well-known names. 
Peter Bart, the longtime editor in chief of Variety, had been close to Polanski, 
and what he told me gave me some semblance of a lead. 

“T must confess that that crowd was a little scary,” Bart said, referring to 
Polanski and Tate’s circle. “There was an aura of danger around them... there 
was an instinctive feeling that everyone was pushing it and things were 
getting out of control. My wife and I still talk about it,” he said. “Anybody 
who underestimates the impact of the event is full of shit.” 

This was my first taste of the “live freaky, die freaky” view: the idea that 
Polanski’s circle, with its bacchanalian parties and flexible morals, had 
brought about their own murders. I thought there might be something here. 
After all, the murders had been solved and the victims had done seemingly 
nothing to instigate them—but Bart, and others I’d soon speak to, still 
claimed that their lifestyles were to blame. 

I had to get closer to those who’d known Sharon and Roman, anyone 
who’d attended these supposedly lurid parties. But the rejections kept 
coming. Pd been in touch with Diane Ladd’s manager, having heard that 
Ladd, who’d been married to Bruce Dern at the time of the murders, ran in 
some of the same circles as Tate and Polanski. Her manager promised to set 
up an interview. The next day she called back, saying that Ladd had had an 
“emotional, visceral reaction.” The manager said, “I don’t know what 
happened with Diane back in the sixties, but she adamantly refused to have 
anything to do with the piece. She even told me that if her name was in it, she 
was going to contact her attorney.” 

Peter Fonda gave me yet another no. Not long afterward, I came across 
him at a gas station in the middle of the Mojave Desert, of all places, some 
five hours outside L.A. True to form, he was in leathers and on a Harley. I 
approached him with my business card and tried to explain the story as 
succinctly as possible. He seemed receptive. But later, when I followed up 
again, the answer was still: no. 


I mentioned the rash of rejections to Peter Bart. His observation stayed 
with me, especially as the months wore on and I began to see that Manson 
might have been more plugged into Hollywood than anyone cared to admit. 
“Just the fact that they’re all saying no,” he said, “is fascinating.” 


Bugliosi’s First Slip 


There was one major player who agreed to talk to me: Vincent Bugliosi. Not 
only did he sign on for an interview, he invited me to his new home in 
Pasadena, the same one where, years later, he would threaten to “hurt [me] 
like [I’d] never been hurt before” if I published my findings. 

There was no sign of that animosity during our first meeting. On a sunny 
spring day, Bugliosi gave me six hours of his time, driving me around to 
show me various landmarks related to the crime and enjoying a long lunch 
with me in one of his favorite restaurants. I was flattered to have captured his 
attention—here was the man who’d put away one of the monsters of the 
twentieth century. Later I would question the motive behind all his 
generosity. 

A prosecutor makes a lot of enemies over the course of his career, and 
Bugliosi, I’d learn, made more than most, both in and out of the DA’s office. 
But considering that he’d once fielded death threats from Manson himself, he 
lived in a surprisingly unprotected home, quintessentially suburban. He and 
Gail, his wife of forty-three years, were still moving in when I visited that 
April of 1999; Bugliosi, white haired, lean, and blue eyed, greeted me with a 
firm handshake and a litany of apologies for the unpacked boxes. In the 
living room, flowers of all kinds, dried, artificial, and real, burst from pots 
and vases. 

Their kitchen, adorned with Gail’s chicken and rooster tchotchkes, 
could’ve been right out of a fifties sitcom. Bugliosi picked up a hairless cat 
that brushed against his leg—a rare Siamese breed, he told me. The cat’s 
name was Sherlock, “because he snoops everywhere.” Gail put out a plate of 
cookies and a pair of iced teas for us. 

Bugliosi was a fast talker. He sent a tsunami of words in my direction, 
sometimes jumping out of his chair for no apparent reason. Gail, an island of 
repose by comparison, busied herself at the kitchen counter. I caught her 


rolling her eyes as her husband told me that the movie version of Helter 
Skelter, from 1976, “was number one that year” and “had the biggest ratings 
in TV history, prior to Roots.” He’d essentially been on a thirty-year victory 
lap, and he had his talking points down cold. It was hard to get him off script. 
As he drove me around that day, he was still reliving his encounters with 
Manson in the courtroom. Sometimes it seemed he was quoting almost 
verbatim from Helter Skelter. On the surface, he seemed chatty and 
forthcoming, but everything he said—for hours—was canned. 

Still hoping for a good angle, I tried to probe, however gently, at the holes 
Pd noticed in Helter Skelter. For one, how had the cops missed so many 
clues in the case—why hadn’t they solved it much sooner? As he did in his 
book, Bugliosi blamed sloppy police work. They never would’ve cracked the 
case without him, he told me. 

I wanted his take on the Cielo house’s caretaker, William Garretson, 
who’d been the only one on the property to survive that night. Garretson 
lived in the modest guesthouse separated from the main home. His story was 
so unlikely that, at first, he’d been the LAPD’s number one suspect. He 
swore that his stereo had been playing loud enough to drown out the murders. 
He’d heard no part of the brutal slaughter, even though the screaming and the 
gunshots had occurred only sixty feet from his bedroom window. And 
Bugliosi concurred, albeit reluctantly. The police, he reminded me, had 
conducted sound tests that supported Garretson. 

I moved on to Terry Melcher. If Manson had wanted to teach him a 
lesson, why did he order the killings of people who had no real connection to 
him, other than that they’d lived at the same address at different times? 
Melcher didn’t know any of the victims at the Tate house. I couldn’t even 
find evidence that he’d met any of them. Plus, by Bugliosi’s own account, 
Manson sent his followers to the Cielo house knowing full well that Melcher 
didn’t live there anymore. 

Bugliosi dodged those questions, instead reiterating the terror that 
Melcher felt during the trial and for years afterward—fearing that Manson or 
someone from the Family still wanted him dead. Could he put me in touch 
with Melcher? The mere fact that I’d asked seemed to unnerve him a bit. He 
said I’d have a hard time getting him to talk. Later, when I did manage to 
track down Melcher, I’d find out why. 

As the sun was setting after many hours of talk, I asked Bugliosi if he 


could share anything with me about the case that had never been reported 
before—the journalist’s Hail Mary. I could see by the furrow of his brow that 
he was really thinking about it. I pulled a book from my bag: Barney 
Hoskyns’s Waiting for the Sun, a history of L.A.’s music industry. I’d been 
reading it for research—what with all the rejections I’d gotten, I had a little 
more free time on my hands than I’d expected—and I wanted Bugliosi to 
look at a passage I’d highlighted. Hoskyns alleged that a few S&M movies 
had been filmed at the Tate house, and that a drug dealer had once been tied 
up and flogged against his will at a party there. Other sources, including Ed 
Sanders’s 1971 book The Family, had made the same claims, but Bugliosi 
had conspicuously omitted the anecdote from Helter Skelter. 

Bugliosi seemed to be in the midst of some kind of internal debate. After 
what felt like a long silence, he told me to turn off my recorder. “This can 
never be attributed to me,” he began. “Just say it’s from a very reliable 
source.” (Pl explain later in the book why I’m treating this as an on-the- 
record response. ) 

When he’d joined the case, the detectives told Bugliosi they’d recovered 
some videotape in the loft at the house on Cielo Drive. According to 
detectives, the footage, clearly filmed by Polanski, depicted Sharon Tate 
being forced to have sex with two men. Bugliosi never saw the tape, but he 
told the detectives, “Put it back where you found it. Roman has suffered 
enough. There’s nothing to gain. All it’s going to do is hurt her memory and 
hurt him. They’re both victims.” 

It was a tawdry aside, I thought, and anyway, Bugliosi had reported most 
of this episode before. In Helter Skelter, he wrote that the cops had recovered 
a tape of Roman and Sharon “making love,” and that it had been discreetly 
returned to their home. Polanski had found it not long after, on the same visit 
with Julian Wasser and the psychic. He “climbed the ladder to the loft,” 
Bugliosi writes, “found the videotape LAPD had returned, and slipped it into 
his pocket, according to one of the officers who was present.” 

The more I thought about it, the more startled I was that the footage was 
so sordid. It gave yet more weight to the “live freaky, die freaky” motto. And 
soon after, it occurred to me: if Polanski had coerced Sharon into sleeping 
with two men, and filmed it, wasn’t that spousal abuse? “Roman’s a sicko,” 
Bugliosi had said. “He was making her do it.” Was it rape? If Bugliosi was 
telling the truth—and that was a big if, I soon acknowledged—the tape 


seemed like something that could’ve raised Polanski’s profile as a suspect, 
and something, therefore, that the police should’ve retained as evidence. 

I hoped that I could verify Bugliosi’s story. It was the first piece of new 
information I’d found so far. In my haste to keep reporting, I failed to see that 
the revelation came with a slipup on his part, one that would take me more 
than six years to recognize. He couldn’t have told the detectives to put the 
tape back in the loft. As a DA, he wasn’t assigned the Tate murder case until 
November 18, 1969, months after Polanski’s August 17 return visit to the 
house. 

In the early phases of a case, police need to talk to DAs like Bugliosi to 
authorize search warrants. If he’d learned about the tape from the detectives 
back in August—if he’d been the one, as he claimed, who ordered its return 
to the house—then something in the police investigation had necessitated his 
involvement much earlier than he’d ever acknowledged. Maybe it was 
something trifling; maybe it was something he felt he’d had to cover up to 
protect some celebrities’ reputations. The point was, we’d never know, 
because it was something he’d hidden from his readers. Though I hadn’t 
caught this mistake, there were more variations to come. When I finally 
found them, it would change the whole tenor of our relationship. 


Ugliness and Purity 


Helter Skelter opens with a famous sentence: “It was so quiet, one of the 
killers would later say, you could almost hear the sound of ice rattling in 
cocktail shakers in the homes down the canyon.” The first half of the book, 
concerning the police investigation, traffics in the dread of that sentence. 
Given Bugliosi’s revelation to me, it was the first place I started looking for a 
break. If he had changed one detail about the case, could he have changed 
others? That question would recur throughout my entire investigation. 

The LAPD had assigned two separate teams of detectives to the cases, one 
for the Tate murders and one for the LaBiancas. Despite the similarities in the 
crimes, the LAPD had concluded, as mentioned earlier, that the LaBiancas 
were the victims of a copycat crime. After all, there was seemingly little 
common ground between the luxe Beverly Hills set at Cielo and the suburban 
couple in Los Feliz. 


The police fanned out in what would become the largest murder 
investigation in Los Angeles history. The LaBianca team operated in relative 
anonymity; the press couldn’t muster much interest in their case, at least not 
when Sharon Tate’s killer was on the lam. On the other side of town, by 
contrast, the Cielo crime scene was like a carnival. The LAPD had assigned 
twenty-one men to the case. Helicopters hovered over the hilltop property. 
Guards stood watch around the clock at the entry gate. 

Detectives moved to lock down their initial suspect right away. William 
Garretson, the lone survivor of the night’s massacre, was dragged out of the 
guesthouse sleepy-eyed, shirtless, and barefoot, shoved into a patrol car, and 
driven straight to headquarters, where he was read his rights and charged with 
five murders. Garretson, only nineteen, couldn’t explain why he hadn’t heard 
anything that night, except to say it might have been because he had the 
stereo on. For three days, he was on front pages around the world as he 
languished behind bars. Finally, police concluded he was just a slow kid in 
the wrong place at the wrong time. 

In those same first twenty-four hours, the Tate detectives got a tip. A 
friend of the victims had been telling people that he knew who the murderers 
were; convinced that his knowledge would get him killed, the friend had gone 
into hiding. He was Witold Kaczanowski, an artist and Polish émigré who’d 
known the Tate crowd through his countryman Voytek Frykowski. Police 
tracked him down through Roman Polanski’s manager. Lured by the promise 
of twenty-four-hour police protection, Kaczanowksi finally consented to be 
interviewed. 

He believed that Frykowski had been involved in the drug trade with a 
host of career criminals and other unsavory characters. One of these was a 
man named Harris “Pic” Dawson, who had, at a recent party, threatened to 
kill Frykowski. Remember how Susan Atkins wrote the word “Pig” on the 
front door of Cielo Drive, in Sharon Tate’s blood? Kaczanowski thought that 
word was “Pic,” as in Pic Dawson. 

The police found him credible, especially because they’d learned about 
another altercation at the Cielo house that past spring, when Tate and 
Polanski had thrown a going-away party. (Although the couple had moved in 
only on February 15, by the end of March they had to leave for separate film 
jobs in Europe, where they’d remain for most of the summer.) At their 
farewell party, attended by more than a hundred guests, three gate-crashers 


had behaved so aggressively that Polanski had them kicked out. They were 
Billy Doyle, Tom Harrigan, and Pic Dawson. 

Hoping to ask Polanski about these three, police anxiously awaited his 
return from London, scheduled for the evening of August 10, the day after the 
bodies had been discovered. Polanski flew back to L.A. under heavy 
sedation, with his longtime producer Gene Gutowski and two friends, Warren 
Beatty and Victor Lownes. At the airport, he was spirited through a side exit 
to a waiting car while Gutowski read a statement to the throngs of press. 

The chairman of Paramount Pictures had arranged a suite for Polanski on 
the studio lot—a place where he could avoid the prying eyes of the press, and 
the killers, too, if they were out to get him. But before he arrived at 
Paramount, Polanski had his car stop at a Denny’s parking lot for a hushed 
conversation with Kaczanowski. Bugliosi never reported this in Helter 
Skelter. The media never knew about it. To me, it was something to explore. 

After they chatted at Denny’s, Kaczanowski got in the car and headed to 
Paramount with the director; they talked all the way to the lot. When the 
LAPD arrived at the studio that evening, they were barred from entering 
Polanski’s suite until he’d finished the debriefing. Bugliosi didn’t find that 
worth mentioning; he only wrote that “Polanski was taken to an apartment 
inside the Paramount lot, where he remained in seclusion under a doctor’s 
care. The police talked to him briefly that night, but he was, at that time, 
unable to suggest anyone with a motive for the murders.” 

Polanski’s friends Lownes and Gutowski confirmed the secret Denny’s 
meeting in interviews with me. Both defended it as a simple exchange of 
information between two longtime friends. And yet Polanski, in a polygraph 
exam with the LAPD, had denied knowing Kaczanowski at all. 

Sensing there was more to the story, I sought out Kaczanowski, who, like 
so many others connected to the victims, had never spoken to reporters about 
the murders. Over the phone, somewhat to my surprise, he promptly agreed 
to discuss the case with me. Yes, he said, the Denny’s meeting had happened, 
but, despite its seeming urgency, there was nothing so furtive about it. He’d 
only answered some of Polanski’s questions about Frykowski’s possible drug 
dealing. Kaczanowski emphasized that his suspicion—that Pic Dawson had 
targeted Frykowski—sent the police on a months-long chase that amounted 
to nothing. 

And yet it was easy to see how Frykowski may have gotten in over his 


head in those months before the murders. It was a turbulent time at the Cielo 
house, I learned—much more fraught than Bugliosi had reported. When Tate 
and Polanski left, they gave Frykowski and Abigail Folger the run of the 
place, and things got weird. The couple threw parties all the time. The door 
was open to anyone and everyone. The crowds grew rowdier, the drugs 
harder—not just pot and hash, but an abundance of cocaine, mescaline, LSD, 
and MDA, which was then a new and fairly unheard-of synthetic. Frykowski 
was especially enamored of it. 

Dawson, Doyle, and Harrigan, the same trio who’d been booted from the 
party in mid-March, were now regular guests at the house, sometimes staying 
for days at a time. They also supplied most of the drugs. By July, the three 
men, all international smugglers, had cornered the market on MDA, which 
was manufactured in Doyle and Harrigan’s hometown, Toronto. Frykowski 
wanted in. Although he didn’t have much cash—Folger, his heiress 
girlfriend, kept him on a tight leash financially—he negotiated a deal with his 
new friends, making himself a middleman between them and Hollywood. 

Soon after we spoke on the phone, Kaczanowski visited Los Angeles. I 
met him in the backyard of his friend’s home in West Hollywood. A 
handsome man with a craggy face, thick black hair, and robust blue eyes, he 
spoke with a heavy accent and a reserved, contemplative air. Though it was 
maybe three in the afternoon, he opened a bottle of red wine and poured us 
each a generous glass. 

He’d been the last of Frykowski’s friends to see him alive. The two had 
gotten together at his gallery just hours before the murders; he’d intended to 
visit the Tate house that night, but he was too tired. Frykowski had called him 
around midnight, likely just minutes before the killers arrived, to try to talk 
him into coming over. 

Now he showed me a large manila envelope full of old ephemera, 
including Frykowski’s airline ticket to the United States, dated May 16, 1967, 
and a reference letter Polanski had written for him on Paramount stationery. 
These artifacts seemed to transport Kaczanowski. The sixties, he said, were 
often on his mind. 

“T can close my eyes and I feel that it’s still 1969. I hear people’s voices, I 
see their faces,” Kaczanowski said. He was amazed at how the usual 
indicators of class and status had disappeared in Hollywood at the time, 
where “the most extreme ugliness with total purity was mixed up.” This 


blurriness was the inevitable outcome of the open-door policy they’d all 
subscribed to at the end of the decade. “Totally primitive, uneducated people” 
could dress and act like visionary artists. “And you couldn’t know absolutely 
who was who. You could have a Manson and you could have a great poet and 
it was impossible to make a distinction.” 

Accordingly, Kaczanowski remembered “so many strange people” 
coming and going from the house on Cielo Drive, where he would sometimes 
stay with Frykowski for days at a stretch. “I didn’t trust them,” he said of the 
guests. “They walked so freely through the place.” He would ask Frykowski 
who these people were, and the answer always came with degrees of removal 
—they were friends of this guy, or friends of friends of so-and-so. That was 
why, after the murders, he felt he’d gotten a bead on who the killers were: the 
same set of drug dealers that Bugliosi mentions passingly in Helter Skelter. 

“I remember Voytek telling me that they threw Pic Dawson out of a 
party,” he said, taking a sip of wine. “They told Pic Dawson to take his 
backpack and fuck off.” Kaczanowski remembered another party, a few 
weeks before the murders, where he’d had to kick out two very drunk guys. 
At the gate, “they were standing on the other side, looking at Voytek and me, 
and they said, ‘You sons of bitches, we will be back, and we will kill you.’” 

All the months of partying with Frykowski had a cumulative effect. He 
met so many threatening characters that, when his friend turned up dead, he 
was convinced one or more of them was to blame. He’d wondered if 
Frykowski, or even Polanski or Sebring, had ever encountered Manson or his 
followers. His concern and uncertainty still felt raw. Here was someone 
who’d been so close to the victims that he’d held on to their possessions for 
all these years—and he still couldn’t rule out the possibility of a revenge 
motive. As I sat across from him, the elaborate puffery of the Helter Skelter 
motive, and all the panicked headlines that came with it, seemed to recede 
into the afternoon smog. 

If Frykowski were alive, I ventured, and Kaczanowski could ask him one 
question, what would it be? Looking down into his wine, he said quietly, 
“Did you ever meet anybody from the group of people who came to kill 
you?” 


“He Who Dies with the Most Toys Wins” 


Having finished what would be her final film, The Thirteen Chairs (also 
known as 12 + 1), Sharon Tate came back to the Cielo house in July 1969, 
more than seven months pregnant. She wanted to have her baby in the house 
she loved. But Polanski, who was supposed to have returned by then, 
deferred his homecoming. He needed to continue scouting locations for his 
next film. Assuring her that he’d be back in time for the baby’s arrival, he 
asked his old friend Frykowski to stick around with Folger and keep Tate 
company. 

That, at least, is the version Bugliosi provides. Once I’d heard from him 
about Polanski’s tape and the seedier side of Cielo, I started pushing harder in 
my interviews, and diverging stories developed. Polanski’s intimates said that 
Tate was grateful for the company. She didn’t want to be alone in the 
secluded estate, especially at the end of her pregnancy. As for Polanski 
himself, his friends described him as careful, conservative, even square, and 
deeply in love with his wife. If he said he had to stay on in London for work, 
then that’s what he was doing. 

Others remembered it differently. Tate had been horrified at the scene that 
greeted her upon her return to Los Angeles. She was leery of Folger and 
especially of Frykowski, whom she suspected of drug dealing—she wanted 
the couple, and the crowd attached to them, out of her house. As I won the 
confidence of some of her closest friends, they came out with intensely 
disturbing stories. Her marriage was in shambles, they said, and many of 
them didn’t want her to fix it—they wanted her to leave it. 

Polanski had established a pattern of abuse, emotional and physical. The 
Sharon Tate they knew, warm and vivacious, was diminished in his presence. 
“The difference in Sharon was incredible,” said Elke Sommer, the German 
actress who appeared with her in The Wrecking Crew. She “just wasn’t 
herself when she was with him. She was in awe, or frightened; he had an 
awesome charisma.” 

That meant that Polanski could walk all over her. One friend, who called 
him “one of the most evil people I ever met,” said that he had smashed Tate’s 
face into a mirror, and, on another occasion, forced her to watch a recording 
of him having sex with another woman. He cheated on her constantly, and he 
made sure she knew about it. Another friend remembered an incident in 
which Polanski had asked his wife to wear the same dress that one of his 
other lovers had worn; when she appeared in her own dress instead, he threw 


her into the pool in front of their friends. Others said that Polanski hosted 
orgies at the house without his wife’s knowledge or consent. 

Dominick Dunne, who’d been close to Tate, Polanski, and Jay Sebring, 
was confident on that point. “I never went to their orgies, but I know they 
existed, and I think Jay was in on it, too,” he said to me. The director James 
Toback—who would himself be disgraced, nearly twenty years later, by more 
than two hundred allegations of sexual assault—was even more certain. One 
night, Warren Beatty had invited him to a party at the Tate house. Toback 
brought Jim Brown, a football all-star who’d become an action-film hero. At 
the party, people began to whisper about an orgy. “I was going to be included 
because I was with Jim,” Toback told me, “and I was certainly up for it, but 
Jim declined.” 

And yet: “James Toback is full of shit and always has been,” Paul Sylbert, 
a production designer and a friend of Polanski, told me. “Nothing crazy went 
on up there. There were no orgies, not that I ever have been to, and I was up 
there frequently.” He conceded that Polanski was “peculiar,” but “whatever 
his kinkiness was, it was on a small scale and quite private. He might’ve been 
hinting at orgies, but there were never any.” 

Orgies or no, at a certain point Tate felt that she’d suffered enough. As the 
humiliations accumulated, she approached Elke Sommer for her advice. 
Sommer remembered telling her, “I’d take the next heavy object, whether it’s 
an iron or a frying pan or a spade out in the yard, and I’d just brain him.” 

Tate wasn’t about to do that, but she did, on a few occasions, warm to the 
idea of leaving Polanski. Sommer thought she was always too much in her 
husband’s thrall to follow through. “There was a tremendous sickness when I 
worked with Sharon,” Sommer said, “a horrendous sickness surrounding her 
relationship. She was quite lost.” 

A number of Tate’s friends were quick to mention the undesirable 
company she kept—with Frykowski and Folger at the top of the list. 

Tate “couldn’t stand them,” said Joanna Pettet, another actress who’d 
become close to her. The two had had lunch together at the house on the day 
of the murders. Pettet was surprised to see Frykowski and Folger, whom 
she’d never met before, walking around like they owned the place. “I asked, 
who are these people? Why are they here? She said, ‘Roman didn’t want me 
to be alone.’” Tate tolerated the pair only because her husband insisted on it. 
On the phone with Polanski, so depressed that she fell into tears, she 


complained that the two had brought too many drugs into the house, too 
much chaos. But Polanski refused to turn them out. She asked constantly 
when he would come home, but he kept postponing his return trip. Moreover, 
she’d tried to stay with him in London, and he wouldn’t let her—he didn’t 
want her there. 

Pd gone to great lengths to track down Pettet, who had quit the movie 
business in the nineties. She lived in the high desert beyond Palm Springs, 
where she was something of a recluse, with no phone. It had dawned on me 
that I might be able to reach her through the Screen Actors Guild—they 
would have her address on file, since they were responsible for mailing her 
residual checks. Through them, I sent her a long letter, and she agreed to 
meet me for lunch at a strip mall near her house. She was slightly 
apprehensive when she first arrived. Then fifty-seven, she cut a striking 
figure, dressed head to toe in denim, with dark glasses that obscured her 
piercing eyes, until she felt comfortable enough to remove them. 

“I lost it when Sharon was killed,” she said. “I had to be hospitalized and 
missed the funeral.” She made no attempt to conceal her contempt for 
Polanski. “I hated him,” she said flatly. As others had, Pettet described a 
marriage in which he exuded an almost casual cruelty toward his wife. For 
four months in the summer of ’67, Pettet had stayed with the couple at a 
rented beach house, and she began to notice how often Polanski bossed Tate 
around. He had a malicious streak; sometimes it reached Pettet herself. “He 
would throw a brick in the pool and watch my dog dive for it and try to 
retrieve it. He stood there laughing. The dog wouldn’t give up.” 

After Sharon’s funeral, Polanski called Pettet. “On the phone he was 
strange with me, cold as ice. There was no despair. And I was sobbing.” He 
wanted to know what she’d told the police. It made her wonder what was 
behind her friend’s murder. “At the time I suspected it was maybe friends of 
his who did it. All I know is, he never came [when she asked him to come 
back], and she was here.” 


Figuring that Polanski’s confidants would want to tell a different story, I 
coaxed Bill Tennant, his manager, into talking to me. Tennant had never 
given an interview about the murders, in part because the events of 1969 had 
sent his life into a tailspin. He’d had the somber task of identifying the bodies 


at the Tate house. A 1993 piece in Variety (by Peter Bart, as coincidence 
would have it) described Tennant’s fall from grace. Through the sixties and 
seventies, he’d found great success in Hollywood, discovering the script for 
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and agenting Peter Fonda’s deal for 
Easy Rider. But Bart had found him, “a gaunt, battered figure,” “sleeping in a 
doorway on Ventura Boulevard.” A cocaine addiction had done away with 
his marriage and his money, leading him to trade “even the gold inlays in his 
teeth for a fix.” In Bart’s assessment, “the shock of the Manson murders 
began unraveling him.” 

I tracked down Tennant in London, where he was sober, remarried, and 
managing Michael Flatley, the Lord of the Dance. He’d become a born-again 
Christian, but he displayed little compassion or forgiveness for Polanski, his 
onetime client and friend. “Roman is a shit,” he said. Echoing what I’d heard 
from other friends of the couple, Tennant said there were two versions of 
their story. “Which one do you want to tell?” 

On one hand, Polanski had fallen into dissolution in London, where he 
was working on a movie and sleeping around while, back in California, his 
pregnant wife was putting together a home. Tate “wound up getting murdered 
because he was fucking around in London,” he said. But that was just one 
side of it. 

“The other story is sitting in the Bel Air Hotel with Roman after the 
funerals and having to address his financial situation, which was not very 
good,” Tennant said, “and Roman looking across the table at me and saying, I 
wish I had spent more. I wish I had bought more dresses. I wish I had given 
more gifts. So what story do you want to tell? The one about this little prick 
who left his wife alone... with Jay Sebring and Gibby [Folger] and Voytek, 
these wankers, these four tragic losers, or do you want to talk about a poor 
kid, Roman Polanski?” 

Tennant resisted the idea that the murders represented a loss of innocence 
for Hollywood. “There was nothing innocent about it,’ he said. “It was 
retribution.” The big value in Los Angeles when he was there, Tennant said, 
was this: “He who dies with the most toys wins. I think it’s pretty self-serving 
to call that period, and what was going on, innocent... What’s innocent about 
drugs? What’s innocent about promiscuous sex?... You tell me where the 
innocence was.” Within a week of the murders, Polanski was “partying it up” 
with Warren Beatty, he added. The brutal reality was that “nobody cared or 


gave a shit about Sharon Tate. Not because they weren’t nice but because she 
was expendable. As expendable as an actor whose option comes up and gets 
dropped.” 

After his wife’s murder, Polanski stayed on the Paramount studios lot as 
much as he could. It was the only place he felt safe. And not just from the 
killers or the media—from the LAPD. “You found the police surveillance 
units and you found that the police in Los Angeles knew everything about 
everybody,” Tennant said: “that there was a kind of FBI-slash-CIA aspect of 
the Los Angeles Police Department, and that they knew everything there was 
to know.” 

Although he had no way of knowing it in 1969, Tennant wasn’t being 
paranoid when he wondered how the LAPD knew so much about his friends. 
Many law enforcement agencies, including the LAPD, the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff’s Office, and the FBI, had maintained units to surveil and 
even infiltrate groups that they considered subversive or threatening. At this 
stage, I wasn’t inclined to view law enforcement with anything approaching 
suspicion. Even so, I was beginning to see the official version of the case 
with a jaundiced eye. 


“In California, Everybody Has a Tan” 


I found it difficult to sort through the stories coming out of the house on 
Cielo Drive. Picture a spiderweb so dense with connections and tendrils that 
it looks like a solid sheet of fabric. That’s what I felt I was working with. The 
Hollywood cliques that had seemed, at the start, so discrete and isolated were 
all mixed up with one another, much more than Bugliosi had made it appear. 
Plus, then and now, people weren’t always willing to be up-front about who 
they hung out with. 

Tate was right to be wary of Frykowski, assuming she had been. He’d 
fallen in with a dangerous crowd. Many of the “primitive” people that 
Kaczanowski met had extensive rap sheets, and their names kept coming up 
when people mentioned the gravest excesses of Cielo Drive. Pic Dawson, 
who’d threatened Frykowski’s life and been thrown out of Polanski’s party, 
had been the subject of Interpol surveillance for drug smuggling as early as 
1965. The young son of a diplomat, he’d gained entrée in the Polanski crowd 


through his friendship with Cass Elliot, one of the singers in the popular 
sixties group the Mamas and the Papas. Like most of the men in the troubled 
singer’s life, he’d used her for her money and connections. Elliot’s 
biographers would later write that her infamous 1966 London arrest—she’d 
been caught stealing hotel towels and keys—was actually a ruse to force her 
to share information about Dawson’s drug-smuggling operations. Dawson’s 
colleagues in the drug business, Billy Doyle and Tom Harrigan, also wormed 
their way into Polanski’s circle through Mama Cass. 

According to police reports, Dawson, Doyle, and Harrigan—all twenty- 
seven, and all romantically involved with Elliot—were joined by a fourth 
partner, “Uncle” Charles Tacot, a New Yorker who was more than a decade 
older. A former marine, the six-foot-six strongman was renowned for his 
prowess with knives; he was rumored to have maintained ties to military 
intelligence, and he’d been selling drugs in Los Angeles since his arrival in 
the mid-1950s. Curiously, despite their many years of drug peddling and 
several drug arrests among them, only Doyle had ever been convicted of any 
crime—and his conviction was later overturned and changed to an acquittal 
on his record. Like Charles Manson, the four men seemed to have little fear 
of law enforcement. 

Helter Skelter paid only passing attention to these guys. They were among 
the few figures in the book who were given pseudonyms. Although Bugliosi 
noted Pic Dawson’s death threat against Frykowski, he omitted an even more 
disturbing incident, one that makes a revenge motive much more plausible— 
and that reveals the extent to which the victims were mixed up in the seamier 
side of the counterculture. 

As the story goes, at some point in the months before the murders, the 
residents of Cielo threw one of their endless parties, with Frykowski and 
Sebring leading the charge. Billy Doyle showed up and, in the spirit of the 
times, drank, smoked, and snorted himself to unconsciousness. Frykowski 
and Sebring, and maybe Witold Kaczanowski, too, wanted to get even with 
Doyle for something. Some say he’d sold them bad drugs. So, before a crowd 
of onlookers, they lowered Doyle’s pants, flogged him, and anally raped him. 

This has become the kind of apocrypha that Manson conspiracy theorists 
can’t get enough of. It’s the same incident referenced in Barney Hoskyns’s 
Waiting for the Sun, the book I showed Bugliosi that day after our lunch. The 
story feels almost mythological, in its ugliness and in the extent to which its 


most basic details—who, what, when, where, why—are in flux. Candice 
Bergen, in an interview with the LAPD a few weeks after the murders, said 
that it was a rape, most likely at Sebring’s place or at his friend John 
Phillips’s (also of the Mamas and the Papas); Dennis Hopper told the Los 
Angeles Free Press that it was at the Cielo house. He described it as “a mass 
whipping of a dealer from Sunset Strip who’d given them bad dope.” Ed 
Sanders, in The Family, reports that Doyle was “whipped and video- 
buggered,” and the location varies depending on which edition of the book 
you’re looking at. 

So what really happened? I hesitated to report on this in 1999; it felt like 
another lurid departure from Manson, and it’s not as if my deadline afforded 
me time to explore every strange byway. But it bothered me that Bugliosi had 
left this out, and that so many people close to the victims regarded it as a 
flashpoint in the case. It was another instance of the resilience of the “live 
freaky, die freaky” mind-set. Plus, even if Pic Dawson, Billy Doyle, and the 
other dealers hadn’t murdered anyone, they could still be behind the crimes, 
or adjacent to them. If I could connect them to Manson, for instance— 
couldn’t they have contracted him for the murders? And if they were selling a 
lot of drugs to anyone who’d died at the Tate household, might there have 
been some kind of cover-up at work? 

So, down I went. 


Thanks to Kaczanowski and a few others who spoke with the LAPD, 
detectives were quickly suspicious of Doyle and his companions after the 
murders. And Doyle himself was getting around quite a bit at the time. He 
was back and forth between Los Angeles, Jamaica, and his native Toronto. It 
was in this last city that police caught up to him in late August. I wouldn’t get 
a transcript of the LAPD’s interview until many years into my investigation, 
but it’s worth including here because it gives his side of the story. And Doyle 
is quotable—there’s something almost farcically hard-boiled about him. 

In short, he told the LAPD’s Lieutenant Earl Deemer that he didn’t 
remember being raped, but he couldn’t be sure; it might’ve happened 
anyway. He recalled going over to see Frykowski at the Cielo house on the 
night in question, sometime in early July. Frykowski, thinking it would be a 
funny prank, slipped some mescaline in his champagne. Folger and 


Kaczanowski were there, too. “It was out at the swimming pool,” Doyle told 
Deemer, “and there was two cases of champagne by the pool... And 
apparently [Frykowski] put some in my drink, and I said, Jesus... I am 
high... Iam really out of my bird.” 

He wanted something to bring him down, and Frykowski was happy to 
oblige, producing some pills that he said belonged to Sharon Tate. Doyle 
swallowed “about eight of them,” and soon enough, as Frykowski started to 
laugh at him, he realized that the pills were something else entirely, and that 
he was dealing with some wild people: 


They were crazier than hell. I didn’t realize they were so crazy. I am 
using the word ‘crazy,’ I mean drug-induced crazy... in California, 
everybody has a tan. Now, if people don’t have a tan, they look a little 
different. You can see things in their face[s] that a tan covers up... 
They were all tan and looked healthy. They looked very straight to me 
when I first got there. And, uh... I don’t remember much more than 
that. 


His observation about California, where “everybody has a tan,” reminded me 
of Kaczanowski’s remark: it was impossible, back then, to separate geniuses 
from charlatans. Everyone blended in. 

Of course, by most reckonings, Doyle himself would count as one of the 
charlatans. He admitted that he was a naturally paranoid person. In recent 
months he’d developed a coke habit, which only exacerbated the paranoia. 
Convinced that someone, somewhere, was out to get him, he started carrying 
a gun. It didn’t help that he often bragged about how much cocaine he had, 
especially when there were women around. “They all wanted to get laid,” he 
said to Deemer, “and the price of admission was a nose full of coke, and I 
learned that.” He would show up at parties with a silver coke spoon and tell 
everyone he had “pounds of it.” His good friend Charles Tacot said, “‘For 
Chrissakes, Billy, what do you tell people that kind of stuff for?’ And I said, 
‘I want to get laid, Charles.’” 

That day, higher and higher on drugs that he couldn’t even name, Doyle 
became convinced that Frykowski meant to harm him. So he pulled out his 
gun and pointed it at the Pole, threatening to kill him. Frykowski, the bigger 


man—and the more sober, too, if only by a hair—wrested the gun from him. 

Here Doyle’s memory got hazy; he apparently lapsed into 
unconsciousness, and Voytek called up Charlie Tacot, asking him to come 
collect his deranged friend. It was possible, Doyle conceded, that Frykowski 
or Kaczanowski had raped him after that. He admitted that he might’ve told 
his friend Mama Cass something to that effect. “I was unconscious,” he told 
Deemer. “I wasn’t sore the next day... not there. But I was sore everywhere 
else.” 

In another LAPD officer’s account of that interview, Doyle puts it even 
more frankly: “I was so freaked out on drugs I wouldn’t know if they’d 
fucked me or not!” 


It took a lot of asking around, but eventually I tracked down both Billy Doyle 
and Charles Tacot. (As for the other two: I’d learned Dawson had died of a 
drug overdose in 1986, and Harrigan was nowhere to be found.) Neither had 
given an interview before, and though they could be cagey, they were also 
eager to relive their underworld glories. Both were old men now, but they 
were still operators who acted as if they were at the height of their criminal 
powers. Impressively foulmouthed, both of them threatened to have me killed 
at various points in our interviews, although I didn’t take either seriously. 

In our first phone call, Tacot filled in some of the blanks from Doyle’s 
story. He remembered driving over to pick up Doyle, who was passed out 
somewhere on the Cielo Drive property. His belt had been split, apparently 
with a knife. A friend who’d come along for the errand said, “I think Voytek 
fucked him.” 

They took Doyle, still unconscious, to Mama Cass’s place in the 
Hollywood Hills. Tacot remembered thinking, “If we don’t take care of him, 
he’s going to go back there and have a beef. I carried him out, laid him by a 
tree, went back to my car and got about twenty feet of welded link chain, 
which I had in there for somebody else, originally. I put it around his ankle 
and a tree with a good padlock and snapped it all together—so I know he’s 
not going anywhere. Cass was in the hospital at the time. She said, ‘Get the 
Polaroid! Get the Polaroid!” 

Doyle came to a few hours later, still very high, and simmering with rage. 
“Tm going to shoot that motherfucker,” Tacot remembered him saying. 


“And I said, ‘No, no, we’re leaving town. We’re going to Jamaica... but first 
you’re going to get sober and you’re going to be on this fucking tree until you 
are.’” 

I asked Tacot: “Do you think Voytek did fuck Billy?” 

“Yeah, that’s why Billy was so pissed at him,” Tacot said. “Voytek would 
have been killed if I hadn’t intervened.” 

“Would Billy have hired killers?” I asked, thinking of Manson. 

“No. He would’ve taken all the pleasure himself.” 

In his interview with the police, Doyle had allowed that he was furious at 
Frykowski and his set. “When I was chained to the tree,” he said, “they were 
the object of my rage. Which was an unreasonable and unnatural rage.” To 
calm him down, Doyle said, Tacot had “chained a sign to the tree that said 
“You are loved.’” Doyle was stuck there for more than a day. 

After that, Tacot told me, the pair headed off to Jamaica, where apparently 
they were making a movie about marijuana. (No footage from this film has 
ever surfaced. Others have said the two were involved in a large narcotics 
deal.) On August 9, while they were away, “Manson goes up and kills those 
people and everyone’s looking for [Doyle],” Tacot said. He and Doyle were 
suspects within days. “I picked up the phone one day and the Toronto Star 
informed me that me and Billy were in the headlines: two wanted for 
murder.” A couple of days later, back in the United States, “I took a lie- 
detector test,” Tacot told me. “They knew I had nothing to do with it. Billy, 
too. He was in Jamaica with me. We were cleared, out of the country. You 
can’t kill somebody long-distance.” 

True enough, but you could arrange for someone else to do the killing. 
Tacot adamantly denied that he and Billy Doyle knew Manson—they’d never 
even met the guy. Nor, he said, had they sold drugs to anyone staying at the 
Tate house. 

“We were consultants,” he said. “We’d tell them if it was okay or not.” 

“Tf the drugs were okay?” 

“Yeah.” He added, “Billy was fucking a whole bunch of broads up there.” 

“Did you ever hear about any orgies?” I asked. 

“If you want to consider Billy fucking the broads an orgy.” 


Charlie Tacot wasn’t exactly the picture of virtue. I wanted to find other 


people who’d known him, who could say if he’d known Manson. It wasn’t 
hard. Seemingly everyone in town had partied with Tacot at some point. 
Corrine Calvet, a French actress who’d worked in Hollywood since the 
forties, had one of the most alarming stories of them all. Calvet was as 
famous for her turbulent life as her film roles. She’d starred opposite James 
Cagney in What Price Glory? In the fifties, she married Johnny Fontaine, a 
mobster-turned-actor who’d been a pallbearer at the gangster Mickey 
Cohen’s funeral. A purported Satanist, she’d been sued in 1967 by a longtime 
lover who accused her of “controlling” him with voodoo. 

I met Calvet at her beach-facing apartment in Santa Monica. Solemn and 
unsmiling, in heavy makeup, her gray hair swept back, she got right to the 
point. 

“The only thing that I can tell you about this Manson,” she said, her 
accent inflecting the words with glamour and gravity, “is that Charlie Tacot 
brought him and the girls to a party at our house. Two hours after they were 
there, I caught Charlie Manson taking a piss in my pool. I told Charlie Tacot 
to get them out of here and they left. After the tragedy happened, the FBI 
came by and told me I was next on their list to be killed.” 

When I expressed shock at this, her eyes narrowed. With genuine malice, 
she said, “Maybe you are new at this. When I tell you something, don’t 
question it! I don’t say it unless it is true.” 

I explained that Tacot had denied ever having met Manson or anyone in 
the Family. “Maybe he has good reason to say that,” Calvet said, letting her 
words hang in the air. She was certain: “Charlie knew them.” 

I pressed her again. Was she sure that Tacot brought Manson and the girls 
to her party? 

“Well, I would not put my hand in the fire, saying that Charlie brought 
them over, but Charlie knew them.” 

I tried to get more out of Calvet, but the rest of the interview was frosty. 
When I asked her for specific dates, or even years, she grew exasperated, 
throwing her hands up in disgust. “I do not know years, do not ask me.” 
Before long, she’d had it with me altogether. “I want you to leave now,” she 
said. And I did. 


Thinking I could eventually get Tacot to let his guard down, I began to visit 


him at the Santa Anita Convalescent Center in Temple City. His health was 
failing, and he had trouble walking. I found him lying in bed naked, a sheet 
pulled just above his groin; he was bald, with a silver mustache, bony arms, 
and a gravelly voice. I noticed a fading tattoo on his forearm. On the wall 
he’d hung a photo of his granddaughter at her senior prom. Later, when he 
rose to get exercise using a walker, I saw how tall he was: six foot six and rail 
thin. Although his faculties were waning, he was sharp. He still commanded 
enough authority to boss around the short orderly who assisted him. 

Tacot shared his room with another patient, and he seemed to resent the 
enfeebling atmosphere of the place—“too much groaning around here,” he 
said—so I offered to drive him to his favorite restaurant, Coco’s, a California 
chain known for its pies. Taking him out to lunch was an elaborate procedure. 
People from the rest home wheeled him out to my car, lifted him in, and put 
the wheelchair in the trunk. Once we were at Coco’s, however, I had to lift 
Tacot into the wheelchair myself—an intimate maneuver for two near 
strangers. Humiliated, he began to threaten me, albeit ineffectually. “Do you 
realize who you’re dealing with?” he rasped as I attempted to hoist him out of 
my passenger seat. “I could have you hurt, or killed!” 

In Coco’s, with food in front of him, he calmed down a bit, and soon we 
were having a freewheeling if combative conversation about the murders and 
Hollywood in the sixties. Tacot had lived in Los Angeles since the mid- 
1950s, when he moved there from Mexico with his wife. He had two 
daughters, one of whom, Margot, would later confirm a lot of her father’s 
story: he was a drug dealer, she said, who operated on the fringes of the 
music and acting world. Although he would often get arrested, she said, 
“nothing ever stuck. Someone always took care of it for him.” 

Tacot continued to deny ever having known Manson, and he bridled at the 
insinuation that he had anything to do with the crimes. The Tate murders, he 
went on, led to “the most fucked-up investigation I’ve ever seen in my life.” 
He had sued the Los Angeles Times for announcing him as a suspect. Any 
effort to implicate him, he said, was probably just the LAPD covering up for 
their bad police work. 

As he grew more comfortable, Tacot made an unexpected revelation: at 
the time of the murders, he worked for an intelligence agency—he wouldn’t 
say which—and reported to Hank Fine, a veteran of the army’s Military 
Intelligence Service (MIS). This had been a [[WWII|World War II]]-era operation so 


secret that it wasn’t even acknowledged by the federal government until 
1972. Fine, a Polish émigré whose true name was Hersh Matias Warzechahe, 
was “an assassin who shot people for the government,” Tacot claimed. 

Thinking the old guy was fantasizing, I barely followed up on the 
revelation. But he, and later Billy Doyle, would often reference Fine, only to 
refuse to answer any questions about him. When I looked into him, I learned 
neither man had been lying. Tacot also described his friend Doyle—they 
were still close—as “a dangerous man. He’d kill you in a fucking minute. 
Both of us are second-generation intelligence. 

“Don’t write this stuff,” he implored me. “You’ll get killed. These are 
very dangerous men, they’ll find you and kill you.” (That was a warning Pd 
hear a lot from various parties over the years.) Tacot reminded me that 
Bugliosi, when he wrote Helter Skelter, had given pseudonyms to him and 
his friends, and not just for the sake of politeness. “He was afraid American 
intelligence would kill him if he exposed us,” Tacot claimed. He added that 
Bugliosi was “an asshole” who’d never interviewed him or Billy. “Vincent 
Bugliosi knows to keep his mouth shut. I’d’ve got him killed. I didn’t tell him 
that—didn’t have to.” 

I tried to get Tacot on the subject of Frykowski, who was, to my mind, the 
victim with the shadiest cast of characters around him. Frykowski was on 
drugs all the time, Tacot said. Contradicting what he’d told me on the phone, 
he said that Frykowski had sold MDA, but only to close friends. 

I didn’t take Tacot out again, but I kept calling and visiting him. I found 
him evasive, or senile, or a little of both. And the more I asked around about 
him, the more he seemed to vanish into the mist of the sixties. Some people 
told me, with certainty, that Tacot had been an assassin for the CIA, that he 
was a “gun freak” and an incredible marksman. (In his 2006 autobiography, 
Since Then: How I Survived Everything and Lived to Tell About it, the 
musician David Crosby identified Tacot as a “soldier of fortune” who taught 
him how to shoot a gun.) Others said that he was an ex-marine who’d served 
in Korea and used to show off his impressive knife-throwing skills. I heard 
that he grew pot in Arizona; that he was a child molester; that he was a coke 
smuggler; that he was an uncredited screenwriter; and that his intelligence 
ties were all fictitious. And the strange thing was, none of this was entirely 
implausible. About the only thing everyone could agree on was that Tacot 
had been involved in a lot of schemes—that he’d been a drug dealer and, 


even more, a drug user. But then, as one source put it, “Hey, man, aren’t 
you?” 

When I looked into Hank Fine, the MIS guy Tacot had said he’d reported 
to, I learned that, like everything Tacot said, there was at least a kernel of 
truth to it. Fine, who’d been a movie PR man from the 1940s until his death 
in 1975, had been in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the 
counterintelligence agency that oversaw the MIS and evolved into the CIA 
after [[WWII|World War II]]. His work often seemed to combine Hollywood and 
spycraft. Eddie Albert, the star of the sixties sitcom Green Acres, told me that 
Fine had sent him on undercover missions to Mexico during the war; from his 
sailboat, the actor had photographed German landing sites and military 
training grounds. Though I found no proof, the consensus among Fine’s 
associates was that he’d continued working in espionage operations through 
the sixties. His only child, Shayla, told me that his public-relations gig was a 
cover—and, yes, she said, Tacot had reported to her father. What kind of 
work were they doing? She never knew, except that it was classified. 

Whenever I saw Tacot, I returned to the subject of Fine. “Don’t mention 
that name anywhere!” he barked, seeming genuinely disturbed. When I asked 
why not, he said, “None of your fucking business! You’re fucking with the 
wrong people!” 

Or was I fucking with lowlifes who only wanted to present an illusion of 
importance? I really couldn’t say. And when I finally was able to talk to Billy 
Doyle, things didn’t get any clearer. 


Tacot gave me Doyle’s number. “He’s a retired old man just like me,” he 
said, “and he may not want to talk too much. Don’t push him if he doesn’t.” 
But Doyle liked an audience, just as he had in 1969. I called him often at 
his home in Toronto, and he talked for hours, sometimes rambling at such 
length that I would turn off my recorder to save tape. Just when he was trying 
my patience, he’d say something provocative and I’d have to switch the 
recorder back on and try to get him to repeat it. He had a short temper, and 
when he exploded, usually out of nowhere, it could be hard to calm him 
down. One time, when he didn’t like my line of questioning, he told me, “I 
was shooting targets at a thousand yards yesterday,” implying that I could 
soon be one of them. Another time, when I’d tried to get some specifics about 


Hank Fine, Doyle yelled, “Go in the bathroom, swallow the gun, and pull the 
trigger!” When he wasn’t angry, he sometimes got a kick out of teasing me: 
he would make a major revelation and then retract it the next time we spoke. I 
got the sense that he sometimes trusted me enough to tell the truth, only to 
realize later that he shouldn’t have done that. 

Doyle believed that Polanski and Frykowski were Polish spies, the former 
subverting American democracy with his decadent films. He was sure that 
Polanski had something to do with the killings. (It went both ways: I’d heard 
that Polanski thought Doyle had something to do with the killings.) He 
denied that he’d ever been a drug dealer. I read him passages from the police 
report, in which he’d confessed to, even bragged about, having vast amounts 
of cocaine. But even after that, he denied it to me. He wouldn’t be stupid 
enough to carry two pounds of coke on a plane, he said. When I asked him 
about MDA, the drug that he and Voytek had allegedly bought in large 
quantities, he said he’d never even heard of it. He relented when I read him 
some quotes from the transcript—okay, fine, he’d taken it. 

I brought up his and Tacot’s alibi for the night of the murders: they’d been 
in Jamaica, you’ll recall, filming “a pot movie.” Doyle admitted that the 
movie was a ruse. He and Tacot had really been doing intelligence work 
there, he said, as part of some effort to keep Cuba out of Jamaica. 

“Dead white men will pull your tongue out if you tell this shit,” he said. 
“You have to understand that the government doesn’t want to have any 
exposure on the Jamaican thing—there never was a Jamaican thing. They 
don’t want to know about it.” When I asked why, he said, “How the fuck do I 
know? I’m a Canadian citizen. I went with Charles on an adventure. I thought 
we were going to do a movie.” 

“But that’s not what you were really there for, and you knew it.” 

“That’s right.” 

It’s an exchange that illustrates how cryptic Doyle could be—and how he 
reveled in it. I had to ask about the story behind his alleged rape. He said that 
never happened, either. 

“Charles was spreading the rape story to have fun at my expense,” he 
explained. “Even my mom and dad asked if I was raped.” And yet he 
betrayed the same uncertainty he’d shown to the cops so many decades ago, 
telling me that he’d had a friend take photos of him naked so he could 
examine his rear end. 


Similarly, he told me that Corrine Calvet was dead wrong when she said 
that Tacot had brought Manson to her house. “That’s a lie,” he said, noting 
that Tacot and Calvet had once dated. “She will say anything to grasp at 
stardom. Men with badges and guns have raised these questions before,” he 
added, “not police, FBI, sitting in D.C.” That in itself was astonishing to me; 
I hadn’t heard that the FBI had investigated the murders, but I would find out 
later that it was true. 

I suggested that I didn’t believe him about Calvet. “You are going to 
come to a horrible truth,” he said. “Be nervous that you may have discovered 
the truth and you won’t like it.” 

As spurious and slimy as he could be, I found him believable when he 
repeated that there was more to the murders than had been reported. Later, 
when Id interviewed so many people that some of them had started to 
compare notes, he said something really impenetrable. “The community has 
looked at this as a settled thing until you started talking to us.” 

“What community?” I asked. “Who?” 

“The ties that bind.” 

Eventually, Doyle became convinced that I was Roman Polanski’s private 
investigator. It was never clear to me how much he actually believed this, but 
it was enough to make me back away from him. I sunk a lot of hours into 
cultivating sources like Tacot, Doyle, and the crowd surrounding them. 
They’d been so close to the Tate murders that they were suspects, and yet 
they’d assumed no role in the mythology surrounding the events of August 9. 
Bugliosi, like the LAPD, had summarily acquitted them of any involvement 
in the killings—they were his book’s classic red herring. But I still wasn’t 
convinced. In their sleazy, run-of-the-mill criminality, their motivations 
seemed much more viable than a lofty idea like Helter Skelter. The more I 
talked to them, the more I recognized certain inadequacies in Bugliosi’s 
story, which had curtailed so many explanations in favor of the most 
outlandish one. 


A Haircut from Little Joe 


I wanted to keep one eye open to the possibility that Tacot, Doyle, and their 
associates had some link to the Manson group. After all, in The Family, Ed 


Sanders had written that it was likely that Mama Cass Elliot knew Manson 
through her drug connections—it seemed probable that Doyle and Tacot were 
pivotal there. Plus, Elliot had been friends with Frykowski and Folger; and 
Elliot’s bandmates were close to Polanski and Tate. In other words, everyone 
knew everyone else, and nobody wanted to talk about it anymore. 

Maybe I could suss out the connections there, but I was less enthusiastic 
about these supposed ties with intelligence agencies—except that I was about 
to get another push in that direction. Dominick Dunne, the Vanity Fair 
journalist who’d been friends with Tate, Polanski, and Jay Sebring, had given 
me a tip: get a haircut from a man named Joe Torrenueva. 

Nicknamed Little Joe, Torrenueva had been eighteen, fresh out of barber 
school, when Jay Sebring took him under his wing as an apprentice 
hairstylist. That was in 1961. Sebring, not yet thirty, was already one of the 
biggest names in fashion, having revolutionized men’s grooming. He was the 
first to “style” men’s hair rather than simply cut it. He patented a “Sebring 
method,” through which “your hair is shaped and conditioned to stay natural 
between visits,” as promotional materials explained, and he introduced a line 
of hair-care products. (Sebring wasn’t his given name; he was born Thomas 
Kummer and renamed himself after a racetrack in Florida he liked.) 

Sebring saw his clients in a private room with only one chair. When 
Torrenueva began working for him, he was charging an unheard-of twenty- 
five dollars for a haircut—the going rate was a buck fifty. But his customers 
were happy to pay a premium, and in turn, he catered to their whims. Sebring 
traveled every few weeks to Las Vegas, where his clients included Frank 
Sinatra and several casino owners. Torrenueva always went with him, and in 
those quiet rooms, as the scissors snipped and tufts of hair gathered on the 
floor, he saw the casual intimacy between Sebring and his clients, who 
confided in him even when Little Joe was within earshot. 

Now, like his mentor, to whom he referred in hushed, almost reverential 
tones, Little Joe was a “barber to the stars.” He saw his clients in a private, 
oak-paneled room in Beverly Hills. His price was a hundred bucks. Dunne 
had told me that if I bided my time and didn’t press him too hard, Joe might 
open up about the murders. When I showed up, he seemed aware of my 
ulterior motive. Slight and soft-spoken, he sighed and paused before nearly 
every sentence. 

Joe was convinced that Sebring’s murder had to do with something more 


than hippies trying to ignite a race war. Sebring, he told me, had been 
involved with mob guys from Chicago and Las Vegas. He cut their hair, 
partied with them in Vegas. Then, after the murders, Little Joe got a call from 
General Charlie Baron, a casino executive and mobster, who told him, “Don’t 
worry, Little Joe, you’re going to be all right.” He presumed that the murders 
had been a drug deal gone wrong, and that Jay and Frykowski had been 
targeted. 

That was all I got. I needed more information. I’d have to get another 
haircut. 

I let a month go by, so I really needed one, and soon enough I settled into 
Little Joe’s leather chair again. 

Charlie Baron’s call haunted him to this day. It came “right after” the 
murders, Torrenueva said, before anyone had any notion of who’d committed 
them. “You didn’t do anything to anybody,” he said Baron told him. 
“Nobody’s going to do anything to you.” The implication was that Baron and 
his associates were well aware of who committed the crimes, and why. 

But then Joe was done snipping. So I went back for a third haircut. 

“Charlie Baron was very close to Jay,” Joe told me in our third 
conversation. He added: “Charlie killed people.” When Baron was a young 
man during Prohibition in Chicago, he “shot two guys who were going to kill 
him for fixing a fight.” He later went to Havana to run casinos for Meyer 
[[Meyer Lansky|Lansky]], another mob figure. When he returned to the United States, he was 
Lansky’s eyes and ears at the new Sands Casino in Vegas. 

Baron was hardly an outlier in Sebring’s shop, which was a “nest of 
mobsters and criminals,” Torrenueva said. But it was Baron who scared Little 
Joe the most, even before his phone call. Despite Baron’s known mob ties, he 
had some type of security-intelligence clearance with the federal government. 
He always packed a gun, and he was close with a cabal of right-wing military 
intelligence and Hollywood figures, many of whom had been Sebring’s 
clients. Little Joe alleged that they “did terrible things to black people,” and 
that “it was Charlie who did the worst things.” 

I couldn’t get him to elaborate on that. But I did ask him why, if he was 
following the Tate murder investigation and knew that the police had no 
leads, he didn’t tell the cops about his call from Baron. Because he was too 
close to higher-ups in law enforcement and intelligence, Joe said. 

He added yet another intriguing name to the list of Baron’s associates: 


General Curtis E. LeMay, a legendary fighter pilot who’d implemented the 
carpet bombing of Japan during World War II. A notorious hawk, LeMay had 
served as chief of staff of the U.S. Air Force under Presidents Kennedy and 
Johnson. In 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, he’d tried to organize a 
coup against Kennedy among the Joint Chiefs of Staff; he wanted to force the 
military to flout the president’s orders and bomb the Soviet missile bases 
they’d found in Cuba. 

It was a lot of names to process, and the implications were dizzying. I had 
one question that Torrenueva was especially reluctant to answer. Why would 
Sebring—at the time, arguably the best-known men’s hairstylist in the world 
—involve himself in crime? He had so much to lose, and clearly he was 
thriving. 

But he hadn’t been, Torrenueva was pained to say. “The deals kept falling 
through. He was a bad businessman.” 

“Do you think he sold drugs?” I asked, aware that Frykowski had possibly 
been doing the same. 

“Tt wouldn’t surprise me.” 

Sebring’s problems had multiplied throughout the sixties. He’d clash with 
other barbers who wanted to unionize. In 1963, a group of his stylists had 
defected, en masse, to start their own business. At other times, he’d had to 
hire bodyguards because some guys had come into the shop and “roughed 
up” several employees, Torrenueva said, for reasons that were never shared 
with him. Sebring carried a gun, and “he shot someone once who came to his 
house and was giving his father a rough time at the door.” 

The bottom line: Sebring, like Frykowski, had a lot more going on at the 
time of his murder than had ever been revealed. Whatever it was, Little Joe 
thought it had more to do with his death than any hippie/race-war motive did. 
Which meant that, in addition to drug dealers and Hollywood’s seedier 
hangers-on, I had to account for mobsters, ex-military figures, and 
intelligence agents in my reporting. I was already worried about wandering 
into the weeds—now I risked veering off the map entirely. 


Coda: Down the Rabbit Hole 


I was writing a story about Charles Manson that had, so far, very little of 


Manson in it. It was more about the way that events, in all their messy reality, 
boiled down to canonical fact; the way that a narrative becomes the narrative. 

I had to decide if stories like Little Joe’s, Charlie Tacot’s, and Billy 
Doyle’s were worth looking into, and, as a responsible journalist, if I was 
justified in dragging my magazine into it. It definitely meant asking for an 
extension from Premiere and risking, in the final publication, looking like a 
fool. No matter how you viewed them, these were conspiracy theories. But I 
was riveted by the stuff I’d turned up that contravened the Manson story as 
we knew it. For better or worse, it felt like there was something covered up 
all these years, ripe for exposure. Maybe with the passage of time, people 
who knew about these things might divulge them at last. 

I was starting to figure out that Bugliosi had sifted so many stories out of 
Helter Skelter—to make his narrative about the conviction of the mad hippie 
guru and his zombielike followers easier and cleaner. If that were merely an 
editorial choice, so be it. But if he’d changed things to protect people, or to 
shore up holes in the investigation, then I felt justified in digging deeper. It 
seemed impossible that a story like Little Joe’s, heavy with intelligence 
agencies and organized crime, could coexist alongside the Helter Skelter 
motive. I knew that, in the late sixties, intelligence agencies regarded 
dissident youth movements as the greatest threat to the nation’s security, and 
they’d marshaled their efforts accordingly. Insofar as hippies, musicians, and 
movie stars played a role in those movements, I could see how the broadest 
outline of Little Joe’s story could have some truth to it. But even a hardened 
national-security reporter would have trouble verifying his claims, and that I 
was not. 

These were the concerns I faced by the summer of 1999. The obvious 
answer would be: keep pushing. The only problem was, my deadline was fast 
approaching. I owed Premiere five thousand words, and I’d written zero.

The Golden Penetrators 


Instilling Fear 


Maybe I was naive to think I could discover what was going on at the Tate 
house in the months before the murders. People had been trying to untangle 
that rats’ nest of rumors for thirty years, and not with a magazine deadline 
looming in front of them. Now Id determined to my satisfaction that 
Frykowski and Polanski had a lot to hide, and that their connections to the 
drug trade could’ve put them plausibly in Manson’s orbit. Beyond that, my 
sense of Manson’s link to Hollywood was still too tenuous for my liking. 
And if I felt that Bugliosi’s Helter Skelter motive was only a high-profile 
contrivance, I needed to find the bald truth it concealed. Hoping for a better 
angle, I focused on one figure who was among the most perplexing in the 
case: Terry Melcher. 

Without Melcher, there would have been no murders at 10050 Cielo 
Drive. He was the clearest link between Manson and the Hollywood elite. A 
music-industry bigwig, he’d promised Manson a record deal only to renege 
on it. The official story was that Manson, reeling from the rejection, wanted 
to “instill fear” in Melcher—so he chose Melcher’s old house on Cielo Drive 
as the site for the first night of murders. He knew that Melcher didn’t live 
there anymore. He just wanted to give the guy a good scare. 

This was a vital point in the case. According to Bugliosi, Manson never 
went to the house the night of the murders—he just sent his followers there 
and told them to kill anyone they found. To convict Manson of criminal 
conspiracy, then, and get him a death sentence, Bugliosi had to establish a 


compelling, premeditated reason that Manson had picked the Cielo Drive 
home. Terry Melcher was that reason. 

Melcher testified that he’d met Manson exactly three times, the last of 
which was around May 20, 1969, more than two months before the murders. 
After Manson’s arrest, Melcher became so frightened of the Family that 
Bugliosi had to give him a tranquilizer to relax him before he testified. “Ten, 
fifteen years after the murders I’d speak to him and he was still convinced 
that the Manson Family was after him that night,” Bugliosi had told me. 

If Manson had wanted to kill Melcher, he could have. He had Melcher’s 
new address in Malibu. Gregg Jakobson, a musician and a friend of the Beach 
Boys, had testified at the trial that Manson called him before the murders, 
asking him if Melcher had a “green spyglass.” 

“Yes, why?” Jakobson answered. 

“Well, he doesn’t anymore,” Manson said. The Family had “creepy- 
crawled” Melcher’s Malibu home—that’s what they called it when they 
dressed up in black and sneaked around rich people’s places—and stolen the 
spyglass. When Melcher himself testified, he confirmed that he’d noticed it 
missing around “late July or early August.” Candice Bergen, his girlfriend, 
had noted the disappearance, too. 

Over the years, Manson researchers have generally agreed that Melcher 
was stretching the truth. Karina Longworth, whose podcast You Must 
Remember This devoted a whole season to Manson, said in one episode that 
Melcher “was vague about the details of his meetings with Manson, and 
probably shaved a couple of visits to the ranch off the official record.” 

It would be one thing to fudge the numbers a bit—it’s easy to see why 
someone would want to understate their relationship with Charles Manson. 
But I became convinced that this was graver than that. I found proof that 
Melcher was much closer to Manson, Tex Watson, and the girls than he’d 
suggested. A year before the murders, he’d even lived with a member of the 
Family at the house on Cielo Drive. 

There was a strong likelihood that Melcher knew, immediately after the 
crimes, that Manson was involved—but he never told the police. I found 
evidence that Melcher lied on the stand, under oath. And Bugliosi definitely 
knew about it. Maybe he’d even put him up to it, suborning witness perjury. 

Just like the omissions about Polanski’s sex tape and Frykowski’s episode 
with Billy Doyle, this raised questions about Bugliosi’s motives. Did he 


change the story to protect Melcher, a powerful record producer and the only 
child of one of Hollywood’s most beloved stars? Had he streamlined certain 
elements for the jury’s sake, in the interest of getting an easy conviction? Or 
was this part of a broader pattern of deception, of bending the facts to support 
a narrative that was otherwise too shaky to stand? Helter Skelter (the motive) 
and Helter Skelter (the book) seemed more illusory by the day. 

Chasing the Melcher angle further imperiled any chance of hitting my 
deadline. It soured my relationship with Bugliosi; it brought on the first of 
many lawsuit threats; and it turned my fascination with the case into a full- 
blown obsession. But it convinced me more than anything that I was onto 
something—that the full story behind the Manson murders had never been 
properly told. 


“T Live with 17 Girls” 


The story of Manson and Melcher starts with Dennis Wilson. By the summer 
of 1968, Wilson, then twenty-three, had reached an impasse. He’d become 
world famous as the drummer for the Beach Boys, helmed by his brother 
Brian; now the band was in decline, edged out by more subversive acts. He 
and his wife, Carole, had recently divorced for the second time. She wrote in 
court filings that he had a violent temper, inflicting “severe bodily injury” on 
her during his “rampages.” 

The couple had two young children, but Dennis decided to rusticate as a 
bachelor. He moved into a lavish, Spanish-style mansion in Pacific Palisades, 
once a hunting lodge owned by the humorist Will Rogers. The home boasted 
thirty-one rooms and a swimming pool in the shape of California. He 
redecorated in the spirit of the times—zebra-print carpet, abundant bunk beds 
—and hosted decadent parties, hoping to have as much sex as possible. 

One day, Wilson was driving his custom red Ferrari down the Pacific 
Coast Highway when two hitchhikers, the Family’s Ella Jo Bailey and 
Patricia Krenwinkel, caught his eye. He gave them a quick lift. When he saw 
them again soon afterward, he picked them up a second time, taking them 
back to his place for “milk and cookies.” History hasn’t recorded what kind 
of cookies they enjoyed, or whether those cookies were in fact sex, but 
whatever the case, the girls told Manson about the encounter. They weren’t 


aware of Wilson’s clout in the music industry—but Manson was, and he 
insisted on going back to the house with them. 

After a late recording session, Wilson returned to his estate to find the 
Family’s big black bus parked outside. His living room was populated with 
topless girls. Whatever alarm he felt was eased when their short, intense, 
unwashed leader, Manson, sunk to his knees and kissed Wilson’s feet. 

This night ushered in a summer of ceaseless partying for Wilson. Manson 
and the Family set up shop in his home, and soon Manson recruited one of 
the group’s deadliest members, Tex Watson, who picked him up hitchhiking. 
The Family spent their days smoking dope and listening to Charlie strum the 
guitar. The girls made the meals, did the laundry, and slept with the men on 
command. Manson prescribed sex seven times a day: before and after all 
three meals and once in the middle of the night. “It was as if we were kings, 
just because we were men,” Watson later wrote. Soon Wilson was bragging 
so much that he landed a headline in Record Mirror: “I Live with 17 Girls.” 

Talking to Britain’s Rave magazine, Wilson offered disjointed remarks 
about his new friend, whom he called “the Wizard.” “I was only frightened as 
a child because I didn’t understand the fear,” he said. “Sometimes ‘the 
Wizard’ frightens me. The Wizard is Charles Manson, who is a friend of 
mine who thinks he is God and the devil. He sings, plays and writes poetry 
and may be another artist for Brother Records,” the Beach Boys’ label. 

This last bit excited Manson, who was desperate to leverage his 
connection with Wilson into a music career. The two cowrote a song, “Cease 
to Exist,” whose lyrics claimed that “submission is a gift.” (Later that year, 
the Beach Boys recorded it as a B side, changing the title, finessing the lyrics, 
and dropping Manson’s songwriting credit—a snub that fueled his anger 
toward the establishment.) Manson fraternized with some of the biggest 
names in music. Neil Young remembered meeting him and the girls at 
Wilson’s place. “A lot of pretty well-known musicians around L.A. knew 
Manson,” Young later said, “though they’d probably deny it now.” 

Among these was Terry Melcher. He and Wilson had pledged allegiance 
to the “Golden Penetrators,” a horny triumvirate they’d formed with their 
friend Gregg Jakobson. The Penetrators, who’d painted a car gold to 
celebrate themselves, aimed to sleep with as many women as they could. 
Wilson’s ex-wife referred to them as “roving cocksmen.” Obviously, then, 
Melcher would want to rove over to Wilson’s house—it was full of 


promiscuous young women. Sometime in that summer of ’68, at one of 
Wilson’s marathon parties, he crossed paths with Manson for the first time. 
After another such party, Melcher rode back to Cielo Drive with Wilson, and 
Manson came along in the back seat. As Melcher later testified, Manson got a 
good look at the house from the driveway. 

When the end of summer came, things went south with Wilson, who’d 
finally grown tired of footing the bill for the endless party: upward of 
$100,000 in food, clothes, and car repairs, plus gonorrhea treatments. 
According to Bugliosi, Wilson was too frightened of Manson to throw him 
out. Instead, he simply up and left in the middle of the night, leaving the 
messy business of eviction to his landlord. 

But it must’ve been more complicated than that. Wilson gave three 
interviews in which he raved about Manson and the girls—and all of those 
interviews date to the winter and summer of 1969, nearly a year after he and 
the Family had supposedly parted ways. Why would Wilson brag about his 
connections to a man he’d just schemed to escape? 

The only sure fact is that Manson and his group decamped to the Spahn 
Ranch in late August 1968. Wilson moved into a Malibu beach house with 
Gregg Jakobson, who’d also recently split from his marriage. 


Having drifted from Wilson—his best shot at a record deal—Manson knew 
he had to hitch his wagon to Terry Melcher’s star. As his chances at fame 
dwindled, his mood darkened. He became obsessed with the Beatles’ White 
Album, released in late November 1968, and started to preach about the 
prophecies of a race war embedded in its lyrics. Things only got worse in the 
winter of ’69, when he arranged for Melcher to come out and hear his music. 
Manson prepared meticulously for the prospective meeting, but Melcher 
stood him up. 

On March 23, a desperate Manson went searching for Melcher, thinking 
he’d goad the producer into a record deal. He found his way back to the 
house at Cielo Drive, having remembered that Melcher lived there. Instead, 
Sharon Tate’s personal photographer, Shahrokh Hatami, intercepted him. 
Hatami had never heard of a Terry Melcher. He told Manson to go to the 
guesthouse and ask the owner of the property, Rudolph Altobelli, who 
explained curtly that Melcher no longer lived there and hadn’t left a 


forwarding address. 

Manson prevailed on Gregg Jakobson—still a friend, and still a fan of the 
girls—to book another session with Melcher. This time, it worked. That May, 
Melcher made the winding drive to the Spahn Ranch and auditioned Manson 
in person, visiting twice over four days. 

Manson had rounded out a dozen or so of his best songs with backup 
singing from the girls. Performing in a gully in the woods, the girls sprawled 
on the ground and gazed up at their leader, who sat astride a rock with his 
guitar. “I wasn’t too impressed by the songs,” Melcher would later testify. “I 
was impressed by the whole scene... by Charlie’s strength, and his obvious 
leadership.” As a courtesy, the producer complimented Manson, saying that 
one or two of his songs were “nice.” He had no intention of offering a 
recording contract, but he saw how the Family’s rustic, cultish lifestyle would 
lend itself to a TV documentary. Melcher suggested that his friend Mike 
Deasy, whose van was outfitted to make field recordings, could come out to 
the ranch and capture another performance. 

Before Melcher could get out of there, a foreman at the ranch came 
stumbling out of a pickup truck. Drunk and belligerent, he was dressed like a 
cowboy, fingering a holstered gun—the same one that would later be used at 
the Tate murders. Manson stepped up to him and shouted, “Don’t draw on 
me, motherfucker!” socking him in the gut, taking his gun, and continuing to 
pummel him. 

It spooked Melcher. Here was a peace-and-love cult with naked girls 
roaming the old Western sets, and yet the constant threat of violence loomed 
over the place. It needed to be documented in all its oddity. A few days later, 
Melcher returned with Deasy and Jakobson, and the Family repeated their 
audition. But what had seemed spontaneous now felt rehearsed. Deasy 
returned a few more times, until he had a frightening LSD trip with Manson 
and vowed never to go back. 

It was all getting too toxic. Melcher conveyed his rejection through 
Jakobson, and that was the end of that. Manson’s last brush with greatness 
was gone, and he became full-on apocalyptic. Melcher never went back to the 
ranch or saw anyone from the Family again. Or so he said under oath, 
anyway. 


After the murders, as Hollywood panicked and the LAPD chased down leads, 
the Golden Penetrators realized that they hadn’t quite washed their hands of 
Manson. This is where their story began to feel unbelievable to me. Manson 
wasn’t charged with murder until late November. But Wilson, Jakobson, and 
Melcher had good cause to suspect him back in August, right after the 
killings. By then, they were frightened of Manson, though Helter Skelter does 
little to indicate their terror. When I saw how much they knew—and how 
quiet they’d kept, when their information would’ve helped police solve the 
case—I realized just how flimsy the Helter Skelter motive was. Its 
unforgettable grandiosity may have hidden a more prosaic truth: that a few 
rich guys had gotten in over their heads with an unstable ex-con. 

First, Wilson and Jakobson knew that Manson had shot a black man 
named Bernard Crowe about five weeks before the Tate murders. And 
Jakobson, who testified that he’d talked to Manson “upward of a hundred 
times,” was well acquainted with his friend’s bizarre race-war predictions. 
Manson warned him that “whiteys” in the affluent homes of Bel Air would be 
“cut up and dismembered,” and that the murderers would smear the victims’ 
blood on the walls, “scatter [their] limbs, and hang them from the ceiling.” 
And yet, when a group of affluent whites really was cut up, and Sharon Tate 
was hanged from the ceiling of her home in Bel Air, Jakobson apparently 
didn’t make the connection. 

Nor did it occur to him in mid-August, when he witnessed Manson’s 
violence firsthand. Manson broke into Jakobson’s home in the middle of the 
night, shook him awake, and produced a bullet. “Tell Dennis there are more 
where this came from,” he said. On the witness stand, Jakobson compared 
Manson that night to a caged bobcat: “The electricity was almost pouring out 
of him. His hair was on end. His eyes were wild.” 

A few days earlier, Manson had shown up at Wilson’s house, too, 
demanding fifteen hundred dollars. When Wilson refused to give him the 
money, Manson threatened him: “Don’t be surprised if you never see your 
kid again.” 

After Manson’s arrest, Wilson fell into a deep depression, spurring his 
problems with drugs and alcohol. Later, he told the Beach Boys’ authorized 
biographer, David Leaf, “I know why Charles Manson did what he did. 
Someday PII tell the world. Pll write a book and explain why he did it.” He 
never got the chance. In 1983, three weeks after his thirty-ninth birthday, an 


acutely drunk Wilson dove from the deck of his boat into the chilly waters of 
Marina del Rey and accidentally drowned. Within days, a rock journalist 
wrote in the San Francisco Chronicle about a jarring exchange he’d had with 
Wilson. “Me and Charlie, we founded the Family,” Dennis had said, apropos 
of nothing. 

The Golden Penetrators, then, had an abundance of reasons to accuse 
Manson of the Tate—LaBianca murders—immediately. They believed he’d 
shot someone dead. He’d threatened two of them with violence. They knew 
he stockpiled guns and knives at the ranch. And the slaughter at Melcher’s 
old house was exactly the kind he’d predicted, down to the most chilling 
detail. Shouldn’t they have connected the dots? Was it possible that there was 
a conspiracy of silence among them? 


“Asshole Buddies” 


Rudi Altobelli, the owner of the house on Cielo Drive—Tate and Polanski’s 
landlord, and Terry Melcher’s before that—became one of my best sources. It 
was thanks to him that I started looking into Melcher’s story in the first place. 

When I met up with Altobelli in the spring of 1999, he’d never publicly 
spoken about the murders that had occurred at his house, except in trial 
testimony. I wasn’t sure why he’d agreed to talk now, and to me, of all 
people; I’d heard it would be a waste of time even to bother asking. But 
Altobelli had always been unpredictable. One of the first openly gay men in 
Hollywood, he’d made a living as a manager, his clients including Henry 
Fonda and Katharine Hepburn. In November 1969—three months after the 
murders, before the killers had been found—he shocked the community by 
filing a lawsuit against Polanski and Sharon Tate’s father to recover the 
damages his property had sustained during the murders. It was an appallingly 
callous response: to seek money from a victim’s family because she’d bled 
on Altobelli’s carpet as she lay dying. 

I knew, then, that I’d have to tread carefully with Altobelli. True to old 
Hollywood form, he suggested we meet at Musso and Frank Grill, a 
legendary outpost that looked right out of a film noir. Many of its red- 
jacketed waiters seemed so old that they could’ve been working there when it 
opened in 1919. One of them led me through the wood-paneled room past red 


banquettes to Altobelli, at a corner table, already treating himself to the first 
in a succession of Gibsons (with extra onions). Compact and nattily dressed, 
he was a few weeks shy of his seventieth birthday, but he had no lines on his 
face and no gray in his hair. Admittedly vain, he’d begin all our meetings by 
asking “How do I look?”—it came before hello. His glasses were always 
tinted: on some days blue, on others pink, orange, or light purple. 

After dinner that night, he kept calling to chat, and I took him out for 
years to come. The restaurants were always fancy; the bills were always 
mine. And I always felt, through hundreds of hours of conversation, that I 
wasn’t getting the whole story. His go-to defense was unchanging: “I may not 
tell you everything, but I have never lied to you.” (Robert Towne, who wrote 
the screenplay for Chinatown, called Altobelli “the most honest man in 
Hollywood”—a low bar to clear, maybe, but I’d take what I could get.) If I 
printed anything without his permission, he said, “I’ll find ya and cut your 
balls off and feed ’em to you.” Fortunately, he later decided it was all on the 
record. 

Altobelli had bought the Cielo house in 1963. In May 1966, he rented to 
Terry Melcher, who was known at the time for having produced the Byrds’ 
“Mr. Tambourine Man” and “Turn, Turn, Turn.” Altobelli liked to befriend 
his tenants—he’d live in the guesthouse and rent out the main property—and 
soon the two became what he called “asshole buddies.” (An affectionate 
term, he assured me.) 

Not only was Altobelli one of the few people who’d befriended both 
Melcher and Tate—he was one of the few who’d seen Manson on the 
property before the murders. He provided critical testimony for the state, 
identifying Manson as the man who’d barged into his guesthouse looking for 
Terry Melcher on March 23, 1969. His ID was reliable; he’d already met 
Manson at Dennis Wilson’s house the summer before. He’d sat on Dennis’s 
bed atop a “dirty satin sheet with cum spots on it,” Rudi told me, “while 
Manson sat on the floor” playing music. “I didn’t like the vibe from him,” 
Rudi added. “I even told Terry to keep those people off the property.” 

It sounded like Altobelli, and others in his circle, had suspected Manson 
from the start. And that was true, Altobelli said. When he heard about the 
murders, he thought of Manson right away. Altobelli was in Rome at the 
time, and his memories troubled him enough that within hours of the 
murders, before he’d even boarded a flight home, he called his lawyer, Barry 


Hirsch, who told him he should mind his own business. 

Altobelli returned to Los Angeles hoping to move back into his house 
right away. The LAPD forbade him. Instead, he crashed with Melcher and 
Candice Bergen at their place in Malibu. That house belonged to Doris Day, 
Melcher’s mother, but she seldom used it. During Altobelli’s stay, Gregg 
Jakobson stopped by and invited him for a walk on the beach. As they 
strolled along the surf, past beautiful oceanfront homes fortified in recent 
weeks with fences, guard dogs, and security systems, Jakobson told him 
“about the musician that Manson was supposed to have killed.” 

Altobelli didn’t remember the musician’s name. I wondered if he was 
thinking of Gary Hinman, a musician who’d been killed by the Family 
thirteen days before the Tate—LaBianca murders. If Jakobson knew about that 
murder, he would’ve almost certainly connected the Tate—LaBianca deaths to 
Manson, too. 

That day on the beach, Jakobson reached into his pocket and pulled out a 
bullet. “He said, ‘This one’s for Terry.’ It was from Manson.” 

This strained credulity. As mentioned above, during the trial, Jakobson 
had said that after the murders, Manson broke into his house, gave him a 
bullet, and told him to show it to Dennis Wilson. The message: “There are 
more where this came from.” Maybe Altobelli was getting all of it mixed up? 
But he was insistent. “No, he said it was for Terry!” 

Then why didn’t he tell Terry about it? 

“Because when I’m told to mind my own business by my attorney, I mind 
my own business. In fact, I should be minding my own business now and 
shut up.” 

How could Altobelli have spent so much time with Melcher, doing 
nothing but discussing the tragedy and speculating on possible culprits, 
without sharing this crucial information—without telling his friend that there 
was a bullet with his name on it? He knew it would’ve helped solve the case. 
Altobelli did say that he called his attorney one more time to fill him in. He 
was told, again, to mind his own business. (Hirsch declined to comment.) 

If Altobelli was telling the truth, then all four of these men—him, 
Melcher, Wilson, and Jakobson, the main links between Manson, Hollywood, 
and the house on Cielo Drive—had to know that Manson was behind the 
murders. And yet all they wanted to do was forget about it. Three weeks after 
the crimes, Altobelli moved back into the house on Cielo Drive, with 


Melcher as his new roommate—an arrangement that’s never been reported 
before. 

Altobelli returned out of a desire to reclaim his home from the evil that 
had infested it. He hoped to restore some order to the place. By then it had 
become a morbid mecca for Hollywood’s elite, who came by wanting a 
glimpse at the scene of the crimes. Even Elvis Presley came to pay his 
respects. Altobelli turned most of these visitors away—but he welcomed 
Melcher, who’d expressed a bizarre yearning to stay in his old place again. 
With Altobelli’s blessing, Melcher lived there for a month, maybe longer. He 
hardly left the property. 

“He probably figured it was safe there,” Altobelli said. “That lightning 
wouldn’t strike twice.” Melcher came alone—he seemed to have split up with 
Bergen. Settling back into the house, he became morose, as Altobelli 
remembered, wandering around in a daze and drinking heavily. Another 
friend, the screenwriter Charles Eastman, who lived several doors down on 
Cielo Drive, said that Melcher showed up at his place wearing Voytek 
Frykowski’s clothing. “I said, This is too gruesome, this is ugly, I don’t like 
this.” 

Melcher was living out his attachment to the place in macabre ways. “He 
felt, as everybody did, that the house was sacred,” Eastman said. He loved it 
so much that he’d even tried to talk Altobelli into selling it to him. Which 
made me wonder: Why had he and Bergen ever moved out? Bugliosi hinted 
in Helter Skelter that their departure was abrupt, but he never said why. 

They left in the middle of the night, with no warning and four months left 
on the lease, Altobelli told me. “Terry blamed it on Ruth [Simmons], their 
housekeeper... He said they were frightened of her. That she was 
domineering and a drunk. That it was the only way they knew to get rid of 
her.” 

Melcher and Bergen, both privileged children of Hollywood royalty, were 
so frightened of a housekeeper that they’d sooner move out of a house they 
loved than fire her? A power couple, scared of the maid. 

Eastman was convinced that something else was to blame: Melcher “knew 
that Manson was after him.” Altobelli and Melcher were always being 
pestered by strange visitors, girls with funny names, he said. “My feeling was 
that Rudi and Terry both had reason to be uncomfortable about Manson and 
his people.” Eastman had even written about it in his journal in March 1969. 


He read the entry to me: 


Rudi criticizes Terry for leaving behind so many cats when he moved. 
When I ask him why Terry moved, he tells me it was money, that 
Terry became peeved at the rent... remembering Terry’s love of the 
house and how many times, according to Rudi, that Terry offered to 
buy the house from him, it seems odd to me that he moved away so 
suddenly, so abruptly. 


None of this had ever come out before. Other friends of Melcher agreed that 
he and Bergen had “snuck out in the middle of the night” because of threats 
from the Family. “Melcher was afraid of them,” one source told me. “They 
said, ‘If you don’t produce our album, we’ll kill you.’” After the murders, 
Melcher seemed “really guilty.” He “probably felt he should have said to [the 
new tenants, Tate and Polanski]: Don’t rent the house, there are these people 
who have been harassing me there.” 


Altobelli gave me the number for Carole Wilson, Dennis Wilson’s ex-wife. It 
was after their second separation that Dennis had taken up with Manson and 
the girls, much to Carole’s chagrin. The two shared custody of their two kids. 
Later, I would hear from a reliable source that Carole had had photos taken at 
Dennis’s house, capturing him cavorting naked around the pool with women 
from the Family. She used them to pressure Dennis, getting him to agree to 
her terms in the divorce. 

Carole kept careful tabs on her ex’s goings-on. “She kept a diary from the 
day Dennis first met Tex Watson,” Altobelli told me. “It has everything in it, 
everything on Terry—she hates him.” Meanwhile, she pursued a romance 
with Jay Sebring, which I’d never seen reported before. It felt significant, in 
light of the fact that her ex-husband had been intertwined with Sebring’s 
killers. 

It was just before the weekend when I reached Wilson. I told her that I 
was exploring the possibility that her former husband and his friends had 
been more involved with the Manson Family than previously reported, and I 
wondered if Manson’s reach in Hollywood was further than had been known. 
“Yes, it sure was,” she replied. She asked that I call her back on Monday— 


we could meet for coffee. 

When Monday came, though, she’d changed her mind. “I thought long 
and hard over the weekend,” she said, “and I can’t talk to you.” There were a 
lot of people involved, she explained—too many. “It’s a scary thing,” she 
said, “and anyone who knows anything will never talk.” 

I couldn’t draw her out on that. She suggested that I talk to Melcher and 
Jakobson, but she wouldn’t put me in touch. 

Meanwhile, I’d started to hear more sordid stuff about Melcher’s 
affiliation with the Family. Bob April, a retired carpenter who’d been a fringe 
member of the Family, told me with confidence that Manson “would supply 
girls” for “executive parties” that Melcher threw, giving well-heeled business 
types unfettered access to Manson’s girls. But what would Manson get in 
return? 

“That’s why everyone got killed,” April said. “He didn’t get what he 
wanted.” Melcher had promised Manson a record deal “on Day Labels,” his 
mother’s imprint. But Doris Day took one look at Manson “and laughed at 
him and said, ‘You’re out of your mind if you think I’m going to produce a 
fucking record for you.’ Said it to Charlie’s face.” Melcher and Manson 
“knew each other very well,” April said. “I’ve tried to get this out for years.” 


The Paper Trail Begins 


I was doing shoe-leather reporting on a thirty-year-old story. The memories I 
heard were rife with the omissions, contradictions, and embroidery that come 
with the passage of time. I would interview people and then rush to the 
library to fact-check, as best I could, what they’d told me—in books about 
the case, histories of Los Angeles, biographies of organized crime figures, 
old news clippings, and more. But if I wanted to report this story with 
veracity, I needed contemporaneous, documentary evidence: the paperwork. 
When sources like Charles Eastman would mention having journals, I would 
beg them to find them, often calling back repeatedly until they did. But first 
and foremost, I wanted police reports and trial transcripts. The case had been 
the longest and costliest in California history, and Bugliosi said that the 
transcript numbered more than a million pages. Where was that? Could I 
have access to it? 


The LAPD told me they’d destroyed all their investigative reports; they’d 
retained some files, but they weren’t about to release them to me. How could 
they have trashed their records of the most infamous case in the history of the 
city? I didn’t believe it. I asked them to put it in writing, and they did, stating 
in an official letter that “a thorough and proper search” produced “no 
records”; all the evidence had been “destroyed.” 

I turned to unofficial channels. I’d heard about a “researcher” named Bill 
Nelson, an older man who was obsessed with the murders. He’d self- 
published several books about the case and had a lot of original police 
reports. Nelson was purportedly a pretty strange guy: he stalked former 
members of the Family and relatives of the victims, trying to befriend them 
so he could interview them. He’d become close to Sharon Tate’s mother, 
Doris, even traveling with her to Paris to visit Roman Polanski, but they’d 
had some falling-out before her death in 1992. 

I looked at Nelson’s website, Mansonmurders.com. The fact that he had 
one at all was still something of a novelty in 1999. Regularly updated with 
accounts of his crusades, his page included an index of crime-scene photos, 
police documents, and interviews, most of which were for sale. 

There was also plenty to suggest his instability. A retired evangelical 
minister, Nelson boasted of “a close and personal relationship” with Jesus 
Christ. He bragged about having attended the “United States Secret Service 
Academy,” where his design for the annual class ring was still in use. His 
exposés of former Family members were vitriolic and often ad hominem. 
He’d published photographs of some of their children, having stalked them at 
their homes and schools. 

But I had to admit that he was a thorough researcher—and I was at a loss 
as to how I could come by these documents otherwise. I swallowed my pride 
and sent him an email. 

We met for coffee at a Denny’s in Costa Mesa one afternoon. Across the 
table, Nelson looked like a retired accountant: midsixties, balding, his silver 
hair neatly combed on the sides. He dressed conservatively, in a button-down 
shirt and khakis. I paid him forty bucks for copies of the homicide 
investigation reports, unredacted and numbering almost a hundred pages. 

He’d gotten these from Earl Deemer, the cop whose interview with Billy 
Doyle I discussed earlier. Deemer conducted most of the polygraphs for the 
Tate investigation, and had copied all the police reports, photos, and 


audiotapes related to the case. How Nelson persuaded him to part with this 
stuff was a mystery: some said he bought the files, others that he stole them. 
He didn’t want to tell me, that much was clear. 

Deemer had since died, and what was left of his records went to Mike 
McGann, a retired homicide detective who’d been the lead investigator on the 
Tate team. McGann lived in Idaho now. Nelson gave me his number. 

Like Ed Sanders and others, Nelson believed that certain elements of law 
enforcement knew that the Tate—LaBianca murders were planned, or they 
knew who was behind them. They’d been unable to act because it would’ve 
exposed their secret intelligence-gathering operations. Nelson had watched 
nearly every televised interview Manson had ever given; he felt that Manson 
“never lies,” he just “withholds information.” But Manson would never tell 
the truth about the murders—it would involve snitching, and there was no 
greater transgression in a criminal’s mind. 

Hearing all this at Denny’s made my head hurt, but I felt I had to indulge 
Nelson. In spite of how far-fetched his theories sounded, some of them 
resonated with me long after I pulled away from the restaurant that day. 


Back home, I put on some coffee and pulled out the sheaf of papers I’d just 
bought, feeling somewhere between eager and anxious. As explained in 
Helter Skelter, the Homicide Investigation Progress Reports were essentially 
internal summaries. They outlined the detectives’ various leads and efforts to 
break the case, presenting the investigation in all its disarray, without 
Bugliosi’s streamlining. 

The thirty-three pages on the Tate murders—“First Homicide 
Investigation Progress Report”—dated to the end of August 1969. Much of 
them was workmanlike, describing the activities of the victims in the days 
leading to their deaths, the chronology of the discovery of the bodies, the 
recovery of evidence, and so on. When the investigators speculated on the 
hows and whys, I sat up a bit. They focused on the possibility that Billy 
Doyle, Charles Tacot, and others had initiated a vengeful massacre after 
Frykowski welshed on a drug deal. The “Second Homicide Investigation 
Progress Report” came six weeks later, describing the battery of polygraphs 
and interrogations through which investigators concluded they hadn’t found 
the killers yet. 


Pd expected to see names like Altobelli’s and Melcher’s everywhere in 
the two Tate reports, but I was wrong. Melcher wasn’t mentioned once, and 
Altobelli was only referenced in passing. If investigators had looked into the 
possibility that the man who owned the house, or its most recent previous 
occupant, had anything to do with the murders, there was no sign of their 
efforts here. 

As intriguing as these reports were, they were kind of a letdown—and 
other reporters had already gotten them. If I wanted something new, really 
new, I’d have to keep pressing. I decided to call Mike McGann, the retired 
cop who lived in Idaho. If Nelson was right, he’d have a stockpile of 
documents that dwarfed the collection in my hands. 


“Everything in Vince Bugliosi’s book is wrong,” McGann told me on the 
phone. “I was the lead investigator on the case. Bugliosi didn’t solve it. 
Nobody trusted him.” McGann spoke in gruff sentences, sometimes no more 
than a word or two—always a breath away from hanging up on me. 

I wanted to know more, but McGann, like others close to the case, 
expected to be compensated for his time. And even more so for his papers— 
he had the records, he told me, but they were available only for a price. That 
effectively shut down the conversation. 

I kept calling McGann, who was willing to tolerate my curiosity, to a 
point. I wanted to know about Melcher, Wilson, Jakobson, and Altobelli— 
what had they told the cops, and when? What about Carole Wilson, and 
Carole Jakobson, Gregg’s wife? McGann said he hadn’t gone through the 
files in years, but he’d look, if he had a chance. 

Two months later, during our sixth conversation—he still hadn’t agreed to 
show me anything for free—McGann said that he had 190 written summaries 
of the interviews by the Tate detectives—some were only half a page long; 
most were a page or two; a few were longer. There were no interviews of 
Melcher, Jakobson, Wilson, or Altobelli, but there were interviews with 
Carole Jakobson and Carole Wilson. He pulled out the latter, dated August 
15, 1969, and started to read a portion over the phone, but soon he stopped 
and raised his voice. “Are you taping this? I’m not gonna go for that.” I 
turned off the tape, but he refused to read any more. Before he totally lost 
patience, I asked if he could tell me one last thing: the date of the Carole 


Jakobson interview. 

He leafed through the pages. “August 10,” he said. The day after the 
bodies were discovered. That meant that both wives, Jakobson’s and 
Wilson’s—“the two Caroles,” as Altobelli called them—had spoken to police 
within a week of the murders. Why not their husbands? And why not 
Melcher or Altobelli, given their close ties to the Cielo home? Where were 
those interviews? 


Revisiting Cielo Drive 


One night, after taking Altobelli out to dinner, I drove him home, as I always 
did. He’d totaled his car after our first meeting—he was certain someone had 
run him off the road as a warning to stop speaking to me—and since then Pd 
become his de facto chauffeur. (“What, the good car in the shop?” he’d 
always say.) Our evenings together usually ran to six or eight hours, with 
Altobelli requesting impromptu stops at the supermarket or at a bar for a 
nightcap. We were close to Benedict Canyon that night, so I took us back to 
the Valley that way. 

“I used to drive this way back to Cielo,” he said, beginning to reminisce 
about “the happiest period of my life.” When I asked if he’d mind if we drove 
up to the house, he said, “Sure, why not?” I sensed some reluctance in his 
answer. Cresting the final hill, we proceeded in silence down the narrow 
road, stopping at the gated entrance to what had once been 10050 Cielo 
Drive. The house had been razed in 1994; erected in its place was “Villa 
Bella,” an Italianate mansion of concrete and marble behind a tall, 
ostentatious gate that concealed most of it from the street. 

“I want to see what number they put on my mailbox,” Rudi said, suddenly 
irritated. “Where is my mailbox?” I maneuvered the car beside it. “10066,” 
Altobelli said, reading the numbers. “They had it changed.” His voice 
cracked. “We had such a great view,” he said, gazing from my passenger seat 
at the sliver of space beyond the gate. “It’s all so cold looking now. My house 
was so warm and cozy.” His voice broke again and his breathing was 
shallow, like he was gasping for air. 

“Let’s go,” he said after a long pause. “Back up, back up—now!” he said. 
When we were already halfway down Cielo, he shouted again, “Just go!” We 


drove back to his apartment in silence. 

At home, with about a half dozen stray cats greeting him outside, 
Altobelli perked up, kneeling down to pet each one and calling them all by 
name. Inviting me in, he apologized for what had happened back at Cielo. It 
was the first time he’d returned since he left ten years before. “I lived in that 
house twenty-five years, four months, and thirty-eight hours,” he said. Now 
he lived in a converted garage in a neighborhood known for its gang activity. 

Hanging over his desk was a framed photo of the house from the 
midsixties and a watercolor painting of the front gate. Also framed was a 
letter from Bugliosi, commending him for his testimony at the trial. Riffling 
through old snapshots on his desk, he handed me fading photographs of 
celebrities, all taken at 10050 Cielo Drive. The last one was of Terry Melcher 
passed out on top of the same desk Altobelli was presently seated at. 
Melcher’s hand gripped an empty bottle of liquor. “Booze and pills,” 
Altobelli said. The photo was taken when Melcher was staying with him at 
the house after the murders. 

In November of that year, when the police told Altobelli that Manson was 
responsible for the murders, the first thing he did was call “the two Caroles.” 
“T said because of their husbands I was stuck with all of this. I was left in the 
lurch. They knew what was happening at the house. Terry was the instigator 
of the whole thing.” 

Altobelli seemed to be toying with the idea of letting me in on something 
bigger. He did this a lot—a seemingly offhand remark would complicate his 
entire portrait of the period. “Terry talked about Manson all the time,” he 
said. “He thought he was wonderful. He asked me to manage him.” But 
hadn’t Terry said he wanted nothing to do with him? “Terry stalked Manson. 
They thought they had Jesus Christ.” 

Later, when I got transcripts of the trials, I’d see that Altobelli wasn’t just 
embroidering. On the stand, he’d said that Melcher, along with Wilson and 
Jakobson, had “talked to me on many occasions about Mr. Manson and his 
philosophy... his way of living and how groovy it was.” Tellingly, in his own 
testimony, Melcher acted as if he hardly knew the man behind this groovy 
philosophy. Presented with a photo of Manson, he told a grand jury, “I don’t 
know him but I think I have seen him at Dennis Wilson’s house.” Later, he 
revised this story, still stressing that he’d met Manson no more than three 
times. In other words, even at the time, Melcher’s and Altobelli’s stories 


weren’t straight. 

Thinking of my talk with Mike McGann, I asked Altobelli if detectives 
had interviewed him after the murders. Of course they had, he said. He even 
remembered when: it had been on the day of the Tate and Sebring funerals, at 
his lawyer’s office. (At the trial, he’d testified to the same thing.) Following 
his lawyer’s instructions, he reminded me, he hadn’t said anything to the 
police about Manson. I told Altobelli that McGann had said there was no 
record of his interview. He was as baffled as I was. 


“It Might Surprise You” 


With McGann stonewalling me, I paid a visit to Stephen Kay, of the Los 
Angeles DA’s office, thinking he might be able to point me toward more 
documents. Kay had helped Bugliosi prosecute the case in 1970, joining the 
trial midway through—a career-making turn for the young lawyer. In the 
ensuing decades, Kay had served as the government’s most prominent voice 
against Manson and the Family, appearing at their parole hearings to argue 
against their release. He was, after Bugliosi, the legal world’s leading expert 
on the Family. 

I met Kay at his office in Long Beach. When I turned the subject to 
Melcher, he volunteered something else I’d never heard. 

“Manson and Watson attended a party at the Cielo house when Terry and 
Candy Bergen lived there,” he said. He was confident about this: the 
information first came out during the trial for Tex Watson, who’d been tried 
separately from the other Family members. Kay had confirmed it with Gregg 
Jakobson. He thought it was another reason that Manson had chosen the 
Cielo house for the murders; when he sent Watson and the girls there, he 
noted that “Tex knows the layout of the place.” And yet Melcher, in his 
testimony, had said that he never once saw Watson inside his house. 
“Melcher doesn’t want to have anything to do with this. You’ll never get to 
talk to Melcher or Candice Bergen,” Kay told me. 

Kay didn’t believe that the LAPD had really destroyed their files on the 
case. For one thing, he said Bugliosi had borrowed what he needed to write 
Helter Skelter and then, conveniently, never returned anything. Bugliosi had 
seen earlier than anyone that the Manson trial “was going to be his meal 


ticket,” Kay said. He took the ethically dubious step of installing his writing 
partner, Curt Gentry, in the courtroom every day to watch the proceedings in 
real time. Gentry was working on the book that would become Helter Skelter 
before anyone was even convicted. The sensationalism only inflamed 
Bugliosi’s hubris. At one point, he grabbed Kay’s arm in the courtroom and 
said to him, “Steve, aren’t I great? Do you know anyone as great as me?” 

And Bugliosi was still dining out, literally, on his Manson stories. The 
case continued to earn him a handsome income in royalties and public- 
speaking appearances. I was curious about those who hadn’t made out so well 
—people still living in the shadow of these crimes, who’d been broken by the 
tumult of the late sixties. They’d have no vested interest in preserving the 
official narrative. 

Through a series of Los Angeles attorneys, I tracked down Irving A. 
Kanarek, Manson’s defense attorney. I’d been warned that his was a sad 
story, but I wasn’t prepared for the dire straits I’d find him in. 

Kanarek comes across as a ridiculous figure in Helter Skelter. Bugliosi 
portrays him as an erratic, bombastic blowhard whose “obstructionist tactics” 
earned him opprobrium from every corner of the legal world. The book 
devotes many pages to his history of indiscretions in the courtroom. By the 
available evidence, Bugliosi wasn’t exaggerating here. Kanarek really was a 
reviled, difficult lawyer, and his conduct in the Manson case bore this out. 
(According to legend, Manson wanted the worst trial lawyer in Los Angeles; 
someone told him that Kanarek was his man.) He objected nine times during 
Bugliosi’s opening statement alone. By day three he’d racked up an 
impressive two hundred objections. The judge jailed him twice for contempt. 
Bugliosi conceded that Kanarek could be effective, even eloquent at 
moments, but this didn’t stop him from calling Kanarek, in court and in 
Helter Skelter, “the Toscanini of Tedium.” 

I met this Toscanini standing on the sidewalk in tony Newport Beach. It 
was eighty degrees out, but he shuffled up in an oversized winter coat and 
threadbare sneakers, lugging a battered briefcase held together with twine. 
Newspapers and plastic bags were poking out. Short and stooped, Kanarek 
had an unkempt, patchy gray beard; his hands and face were streaked with 
dirt, as if he hadn’t bathed for weeks. There were sores on his body. He was 
missing most of his teeth. 

Once Kanarek learned I had a car, he asked me to drive him to a Barnes & 


Noble, where the cashier handed him a copy of the Los Angeles Times and 
sent him on his way. It was the previous day’s paper, he told me—that’s why 
he didn’t have to pay for it. 

Then we got lunch outside at Santa Monica Seafood, a relatively upscale 
chain. Kanarek struck me as sharp, but eccentric. His explosive volume led 
diners at two other tables to relocate indoors. He’d shout things like “Manson 
didn’t kill anyone! He’s the one who should’ve gotten immunity!” or “All 
Charlie wanted to do was screw girls! He didn’t know they were going to 
murder those people!” Most of his diatribes took on Bugliosi, for whom he 
had endless epithets: Liar! Cheat! Crook! Con man! Adulterer! Stalker! 
Woman beater! Son of a bitch! “And worse,” he shouted, causing another 
table to flee, “an indicted perjurer who used his influence to be acquitted 
during his trial!” 

When I asked if Kanarek was paid to defend Manson, he smiled wryly 
and said that he was, but that confidentiality prevented him from revealing by 
whom. 

“Tt would be big news,” he said. “It might surprise you.” (If Kanarek had a 
benefactor, another lawyer later told me, that white knight wasn’t generous— 
Kanarek apparently spent most of the trial living out of his car and sleeping 
in the press room at the courthouse.) 

Over the ten years prior to our meeting, Kanarek had discovered his wife 
was cheating on him; he’d wandered into traffic and been struck by a car; 
he’d suffered a nervous breakdown and spent time in a mental institution. 
He’d lost his law firm, his license to practice, and his life’s savings. Now he 
was living on social security at a motel in Costa Mesa, the next town over. 
After lunch, I offered to drive him back. He took me up on it. But could I 
take him on “a few more stops” before we parted ways? 

“A few more stops” turned into two harrowing hours in my 1988 Acura. 
Kanarek screamed at me for missing turns that he’d told me to take just as we 
were passing them. We drove in circles around Orange County until, to my 
horror, he announced that he’d decided to accompany me back to L.A.— 
which meant two more hours in the car with him, during rush-hour traffic. 
Almost as soon as we pulled onto the freeway, he was ranting again. When 
he said again that Bugliosi was an “indicted perjurer,” I asked him to explain. 

Belittling me for not having done my homework, Kanarek said that during 
the Manson trial someone had leaked the rumor about Manson’s celebrity 


“hit list” to a journalist named Bill Farr, who’d published it in violation of the 
court’s gag order. The hit-list scoop must’ve come from one of the lawyers 
on the case—they were the only ones with access to it. With the jury out of 
the courtroom, the judge made the attorneys swear under oath that they 
hadn’t slipped the information to Farr, who’d refused to reveal his source. All 
six attorneys denied having done it. After the trial, the judge, still suspicious, 
empaneled a grand jury to investigate the incident. They indicted two of the 
attorneys for lying. One was Daye Shinn, Susan Atkins’s defense attorney. 
The other was Bugliosi. 

“Read the grand jury transcript!” Kanarek shouted. The state decided to 
prosecute the case. But if Bugliosi was convicted of perjury, it would 
jeopardize the verdicts in the Manson trial, and the DA’s office couldn’t 
stand for that. They got the judge to dismiss the charges on a technicality— 
they colluded, that is, to protect the convictions from the longest, most 
expensive criminal trial in U.S. history. “It was a sweetheart deal, don’t you 
see?” Kanarek shouted, his spittle spraying my face. 

It wasn’t mentioned in Helter Skelter, I said. Of course it wasn’t, Kanarek 
scoffed. Neither was the fact that Bugliosi “stalked his milkman” and “beat 
up his mistress.” I should look up those cases, too, both of which, he said, 
had been “taken care of” because of Bugliosi’s political clout. “He’s a 
criminal,” he shouted, “and dangerous, too!” 

I thought Kanarek was unstable, so I didn’t put much stock in his stories. I 
was relieved when we got to Hollywood; I wouldn’t have to endure any more 
of his delusions. As he gathered his things and got out, I started to worry 
about him. It’d occurred to me that he might’ve been homeless. I offered him 
some cash, but he waved it away, asking me instead to promise that I’d look 
into his claims about Bugliosi. I watched him disappear into the crowd on the 
low-rent end of Hollywood Boulevard. Later that year, when my relationship 
with Bugliosi began to sour, I’d find that everything he said was true. 


Coda: I’m Not the Oracle 


Pd been sending progress reports to Premiere. The magazine’s editor in 
chief, Jim Meigs, was hooked on the story—he was as invested as I was. In 
the middle of May 1999, the editors agreed to extend my deadline a second 


time. That meant the piece would be too late for the anniversary of the 
murders, but it didn’t matter, they told me, as long as I could deliver 
something big. I was relieved, at least in the short term. In the long term, I 
was Starting to feel the pressure of having to produce something mind- 
blowing. I had to get it right—and to do that, I had to push harder on my 
sources, find new ones, and, most critically, find more of the documents 
generated during the investigation. 

Having heard so often that Terry Melcher would never talk to me, I knew 
one thing I could do to set my story apart: get Terry Melcher to talk to me. 
Pd gotten his number, but I didn’t want to use it until I was sure I had some 
good questions to ask him. I figured I’d only get one shot. I finally called him 
in early June. He was articulate and, from the start, irritable and distrustful. 

“I get so many goddamned calls about this crap from all over the world,” 
he said. “I don’t know anything about this shit. Rudi [Altobelli] called me for 
the first time in ten or fifteen years a few days ago and told me the story of 
the bullets. I don’t know if that’s real but, you know, so what? What are you 
gonna do?” 

“At the time of the murders,” I asked, “did you suspect Manson?” 

“T had no idea. No idea whatsoever. I used to audition three or four bands 
a week. They all looked the same. They all looked like the cast of Hair.” 

“How many times did you meet Manson?” 

“Once, very briefly, at Dennis Wilson’s house, and the second time at the 
ranch.” 

“But I’ve spoken to people who claim that you knew them a lot better.” 

“T really didn’t,” Melcher said. 

Why had he moved out of the Cielo house so suddenly? It was “totally 
ridiculous” to pin that on his fear of Manson, he said. He still blamed his 
housekeeper, Ruth Simmons. 

“Tt’s just hard to believe that someone as powerful as you would move out 
of his house rather than fire the maid,” I said. 

“Tt’s really true. I just couldn’t figure out what else to do.” Plus, his mom 
had vacated their Malibu beach house, and he thought it was a good idea to 
live there to prevent it from falling into disrepair. 

Next I probed his friendship with Dennis Wilson. How could he dodge the 
fact that both of them, plus Gregg Jakobson, should’ve suspected Manson as 
soon as they learned of the murders? 


Melcher said his friendship with Wilson had dissolved around that time, 
as Wilson became increasingly reticent. The rumor was that Wilson “knew 
that they were killing people,’ Melcher said. “He was so freaked out he just 
didn’t want to live anymore. He was afraid, and he thought he should have 
gone to the authorities, but he didn’t, and then the rest of it happened. So he 
was in some way just tremendously guilty—now I don’t know that that’s 
true...” 

“And that guilt doesn’t apply to you, too?” I asked. 

“I don’t think so! Christ, if they wanted to get me, all my doors were wide 
open that whole summer.” After the murders, he’d heard that Wilson met 
with Bugliosi and “all the DAs in the state of California in one great big 
room,” and that Wilson had managed to eke out only one sentence about the 
Family: “‘Well, we hung around and smoked a little pot and sang some 
songs.’ Period. That was it. That was his entire statement.” 

“Why would Vince settle for that?” I asked. 

“I dunno, he thought he’d just put him on the stand.” 

“But he didn’t put him on the stand,” I said. This was something I’d been 
thinking about a lot. Dennis Wilson would’ve been a star witness, since he’d 
known Manson so well and had seen his violent tendencies. If he didn’t want 
to testify, Bugliosi could have subpoenaed him; he did it to force testimony 
from plenty of others. Why not Wilson? 

“Well, they thought he was nuts, and by that time he was,” Melcher said. 
“He had a hard time separating reality from fantasy, seriously. He had 
inventions. He tried to sell me once a new invention that was the size of a 
cigarette box, an antigravity device. You kept it in your glove compartment, 
but when you get into a traffic jam, you just turn it on and fly right over the 
other cars. He really thought it worked.” 

I had more questions, but I could feel him growing impatient. “I’m not the 
oracle about this thing,” Melcher said. “I just know that it was an incredible 
pain in the ass.” 

That pain would continue. Listening back to my tape of the call, Pd 
realize that ’'d caught Melcher in a lie, one that implicated Bugliosi—and 
gave me my best shot yet at proving that both of them were involved in a 
cover-up.

The Holes in Helter Skelter 


Moorehouse Moves In 


As my trust in Bugliosi faltered, I kept revisiting Helter Skelter, turning its 
pages in search of some detail that felt forced or wrong—especially where 
Terry Melcher was concerned. One day, a few sentences jumped out at me: 


After Terry Melcher had moved out of the [Cielo Drive] residence, but 
before the Polanskis had moved in, Gregg Jakobson had arranged for a 
Dean Moorehouse to stay there for a brief period. During this time Tex 
Watson had visited Moorehouse at least three, and possibly as many as 
Six, times. 


Emphasis mine. Something about that offhand phrasing—“a Dean 
Moorehouse”—raised a red flag for me. 

This was the only time Moorehouse was mentioned in the book. He had 
been a peripheral member of the Family. A wavering Protestant minister, 
insurance salesman, and married father of three, he was living in San Jose 
when he first encountered Manson, in 1967, when the ex-con was fresh out of 
federal prison and hitchhiking. Moorehouse pulled over to give him a lift, 
which turned into an invitation to dinner, which blossomed into a friendship 
of sorts. Moorehouse, who’d strayed from his ministry and was himself on 
probation for a forgery charge, was searching for something new and was 
eager to discuss spirituality; Manson was eager to ogle Moorehouse’s fifteen- 


year-old daughter, Ruth Ann. 

Before long, Manson absconded with Ruth Ann on a trip up the California 
coast, prompting her mother to report her to the police as a runaway. Dean 
Moorehouse had left the marriage by then—he’d fallen under the spell of the 
sixties and grown a long white beard. By March 1968, he was in trouble with 
the law again, facing an arrest for contributing to the delinquency of a minor; 
police had found him when they raided a home in search of marijuana. Soon 
afterward, he was arrested again, this time for selling LSD. The legend is that 
Manson persuaded him to try it for the first time, after which he renounced 
his earthly possessions. 

Moorehouse kept chasing his daughter, who’d remained with the Family; 
Manson had rechristened her “Ouisch.” When Moorehouse followed them to 
Dennis Wilson’s house in Pacific Palisades, Manson kneeled and kissed his 
feet, launching a charm offensive that effectively ended the conflict. 
Increasingly sympathetic to the Family’s philosophies, Moorehouse moved 
into the back cabin and lived there rent-free in exchange for maintaining the 
landscaping. Manson had converted a onetime Christian minister. 

But when had Moorehouse taken up residence in the Cielo home? 
Melcher had told me he had no memory of it. Bugliosi wrote that it was after 
Melcher moved out, meaning in January 1969. 

I found Moorehouse in the phone book and gave him a call. He was 
friendly, though spacey. Now seventy-nine, he was living in northern 
California under the name “Baba,” which Manson had given him. He’d had 
more than four hundred LSD trips between 1967 and 1972. “When I talk to 
you, I’m talking to myself,” he explained. “When you talk to me, you’re 
talking to yourself.” 

Be that as it may, he had a sharp recall for his time with Manson, and 
what he told me didn’t vindicate Melcher or Bugliosi in the slightest. It was 
impossible that he’d moved into the Cielo house in January 1969, for one 
simple reason: he’d gone to prison then. 

Moorehouse had been arrested on a drug charge in Ukiah, California. In 
the midst of his time with the Family, he had to head back north for his trial. 
“They convicted me in December of ’68,” he said. “I was due back there at 
the end of December for sentencing, and then on January 3 they hauled me 
off to Vacaville,” a correctional facility. 

Moorehouse said he’d really lived at Cielo “off and on” throughout the 


summer of ’68, when Melcher lived there. “Terry was a good friend,” he 
explained, “and when I first met him at Dennis’s, he said, ‘If it’s okay with 
you Pll send my chauffeur down one of these days and have you come up to 
my house.’” Melcher “took me in and showed me a bedroom and said, “This 
is your bedroom, you can stay here anytime that you want.’ So I was staying 
there off and on, whenever I felt like it.” He also confirmed a detail from Ed 
Sanders’s The Family: that Melcher had let him borrow his Jaguar for the 
long drive to Ukiah. “I drove the Jaguar up there with Tex Watson,” he said. 
Melcher “gave it to me to use on this trip and he gave me his credit card to 
use for gas and anything that happened to the car.” 

I asked Moorehouse for written proof of his time in prison. With his 
permission, I got a copy of his parole record from the state of California. It 
showed that he entered the prison system on January 2, 1969. 

So Bugliosi’s timeline was wrong, and Melcher had lied to me. I felt I had 
to talk to Melcher about this, though I knew it’d anger him—he might cut me 
off afterward. Still, I called him up and laid out the evidence as gingerly as I 
could. Melcher wasn’t having it. He stuck to the story as Bugliosi had told it 
in Helter Skelter and promptly got rid of me. 

Not long after, I got a disturbing call from Rudi Altobelli, sounding more 
upset and angry than I’d ever heard him. He’d been in touch with Melcher for 
the first time in many years. Their conversations had left him feeling out of 
the loop. In Altobelli’s eyes, the Golden Penetrators—Jakobson, Wilson, 
Melcher—had always known that Manson had spent time up at the house. 
But they were too scared to say it on the stand. That task fell to Altobelli, 
who now felt he’d been pressured into talking about it under oath without 
understanding the full story. 

Once they’d started talking again, Altobelli asked Melcher about Dean 
Moorehouse, with my reporting in mind. Melcher had snapped, saying he 
was going to call Bugliosi. “Vince was supposed to take care of all that,” he 
said, “and now it’s all resurfacing.” 


Melcher’s Lies 


Stephen Kay of the Los Angeles DA’s office told me to call another longtime 
employee there, Sandi Gibbons. She might be sympathetic to my aims. 


Before she worked for the DA, Gibbons had been a journalist, and her 
coverage of the Manson trial left her deeply skeptical of Bugliosi and his 
motives. She became one of several reporters who believed that Bugliosi was 
corrupt, arrogant, vain, even crazy; later, when he pursued elected office, she 
wrote a number of stories detailing his misconduct as a prosecutor. 

I took Gibbons out to lunch and found her impressively forthright. Soft- 
spoken and direct, she was certain that Bugliosi had covered up for Terry 
Melcher during the trial. The two must have made some kind of deal: you 
testify to this and I’ll keep you out of that. She also confirmed that Bugliosi 
had stolen a bunch of the DA’s files for his book, knowing full well that it 
was illegal to remove them. It bothered her that he was always portrayed as 
upstanding and aboveboard—he was a snake. She could still recall the sight 
of a vein throbbing in his temple—if I ever saw that vein, she warned me, it 
meant that Bugliosi was about to blow his stack. 

Once I’d earned her trust, she agreed to show me the DA’s Manson file. I 
could make photocopies of anything I wanted, though she would have to 
supervise me as I went through everything. She was under no obligation to 
show me any of these documents—and, though she never said it, I was under 
the impression that my visits weren’t exactly authorized. 

Gibbons led me through the labyrinth of the DA’s office and unlocked a 
storage room. Long, narrow, and windowless, the room accommodated a row 
of cabinets with barely enough space for the two chairs that Gibbons and I 
carried in. I leafed through endless folders containing police reports, 
interview notes, investigation summaries, chronologies, photographs, rap 
sheets, mug shots, suspect lists—and, best of all, a half dozen or more faded 
legal pads of Bugliosi’s interviews with his most prized witnesses. I made 
notes and set aside any documents I wanted to copy—Gibbons had to clear 
them, but she approved everything at a glance. Several times she called my 
attention to folders that had nothing in them, telling me that Bugliosi or Bill 
Nelson had removed their contents. I spent hours in that room, returning four 
times in the next few weeks and several more times in the ensuing years. 

On my third visit I struck gold: a long yellow legal pad with pages of 
notes scrawled in black ink, much of it crossed through but still legible. It 
was an interview of one of Bugliosi’s key witnesses, Danny DeCarlo, who 
testified for eight consecutive days, often under blistering cross-examination. 
A biker from Venice in a gang called the Straight Satans, DeCarlo began 


staying at the Spahn Ranch in the spring of ’69. He and his associates 
provided a degree of security that endeared him to Manson, who’d grown 
paranoid and embattled. DeCarlo’s father was in the firearms business and, 
although Danny was never a full-fledged member of the Family, he soon ran 
their arsenal, a cache of weapons that grew to include a submachine gun. In 
exchange, he and the other bikers got access to drugs and the Family’s girls. 
His testimony did a lot of heavy lifting for Bugliosi. He detailed Manson’s 
plan to ignite the Helter Skelter race war; he outlined the ways Manson 
dominated his followers; and he identified the weapons used in the murders. 

In the crossed-out sections of Bugliosi’s notes, to my astonishment, 
DeCarlo described three visits by Terry Melcher to the Manson Family 
—after the murders. 

I read them, reread them, and reread them again. I couldn’t quite believe 
what I was seeing. I took scrupulous, word-for-word notes, in case Gibbons 
looked too closely at the flagged pages and realized that they completely 
upended one of the most important cases in her office’s history. Luckily, she 
let me photocopy them without a second glance. 

At home, I looked again. I hadn’t imagined it. In an interview on February 
11, 1970, DeCarlo described Melcher’s two visits to the Spahn Ranch in late 
August and early September, 1969, and his third visit to the Barker Ranch— 
more than two hundred miles away—in mid-September. 

According to Bugliosi’s notes, DeCarlo didn’t approach Melcher on any 
of these occasions, so he didn’t know what Melcher and Manson discussed— 
but he was certain, each time, that it was Melcher he saw. Bugliosi’s notes on 
the two visits to the Spahn Ranch read: 


[DeCarlo] released 72 hours after the bust on 8-16-69. Went back to 
Venice for a few days & then went back to [Spahn] ranch. Week or 
week & a half later, went up to Barker with Tex & Bruce Davis in a 
flatbed truck. Manson & 4 or 5 girls left at same time in a car. Rest of 
family stayed at Spahn. Between time that Danny returned to the 
Ranch & time he left for Barker, definitely saw Melcher out at [Spahn] 
ranch. Heard girls say, “Terry’s coming, Terry’s coming.” Melcher 
drove up in a Metro truck... by himself. Melcher stayed for 3 or 4 
hours. 


3 or 4 days later, saw Melcher in his same truck. 


Then he writes of the third visit, which occurred in the canyon passageway to 
the Family’s hideouts in Death Valley: 


1% weeks later saw Melcher with Gypsy & Brenda at bottom of Golar 
Wash near Ballarat, sitting in a car with the girls. DeCarlo was with 
Sadie, Tex, Manson, Bruce & Dennis (w[itness]’s child) on foot. All of 
them got in Melcher’s car, everyone in the car. (Brenda had been the 
driver. Melcher only a passenger. Everyone called Melcher “Terry[.]’) 
Charlie took over the driver’s seat & drove to Ridgecrest & picked up 
a 1959 Buick. DeCarlo & rest then drove off leaving Melcher, Manson 
& Brenda in the car they had. That’s the last time W[itness] saw 
Melcher. 


I cross-referenced this with the trial transcripts, which I’d photocopied at the 
California Court of Appeals. Pulling Melcher’s testimony from my filing 
cabinet, I saw that at the grand jury hearing in December 1969, Bugliosi had 
asked him whether he ever saw Manson after his May 1969 visit to the Spahn 
Ranch. “No, I didn’t,” Melcher replied under oath. 

During the trial, Bugliosi asked him again: “After this second occasion 
that you went to the Spahn Ranch, which was a couple of days after May 18, 
1969, did you ever see Mr. Manson thereafter?” 

“No,” Melcher said—again under oath. 

Next he was cross-examined by the defense’s Paul Fitzgerald: “Do you 
recall the last time you saw Charles Manson?” 

“Yeah, just a few days after May 18... at the ranch.” 

Three different times on the stand, always as a witness for Bugliosi, 
Melcher lied about not seeing Manson after May 1969. Next, I pulled out 
Danny DeCarlo’s testimony to see if Bugliosi had ever asked him about 
Melcher. It never happened. 

This was a stunner, never before revealed. Without DeCarlo’s testimony, 
Bugliosi said he might never have gotten his convictions. Only Linda 
Kasabian, the member of the Family who testified in exchange for immunity, 
spent more time on the stand. 


Clearly, this was information Bugliosi didn’t want before the jury. But 
why? Was it simply because any postmurder visits by Melcher undermined 
the Helter Skelter motive? Bugliosi argued that Manson chose the Cielo 
house to “instill fear” in Melcher, as Susan Atkins said. But if Melcher were 
with Manson after the murders, where was the fear? And, most important: 
What were these additional meetings about? Maybe Melcher knew that the 
Family was behind the murders but, for some reason, believed he was safe. 
Was this the secret Bugliosi was hiding, and, if so, to whose benefit? 

As I read the DA’s file more carefully, I found that every single thing 
DeCarlo and Bugliosi had discussed that day was later repeated by DeCarlo 
on the witness stand—except the descriptions of Melcher’s visits after the 
murders. In his notes, Bugliosi had crossed out all of these references. 

The defense should have received a copy of the DeCarlo interview. 
Bugliosi was legally required to turn over all his evidence to the other side. 

As soon as I could, I scheduled a lunch with the defense’s Paul Fitzgerald, 
to see if he knew anything about this. We met at his favorite dim sum 
restaurant downtown, near the courthouse. Fitzgerald, an ex-boxer who was 
legendary in L.A. legal circles, was his usual animated self: loud, vulgar, 
slapping the table to make his points, already into his second martini before 
the first course arrived. 

Wasting no time, I showed him the documents I’d copied at the DA’s, 
trying not to sway his reaction. His mouth dropped open. “This is Vince 
Bugliosi’s handwriting,” he said. “I never saw this before! Obviously [they] 
didn’t want to put on this evidence.” Fitzgerald and the defense team had 
paid a lot of attention to DeCarlo, thinking he might be an asset to them. “He 
was not a member of the Family, had a good relationship with truth, lived at 
the ranch, was an outsider—pretty straightforward guy in most ways, 
credible. I liked him. He didn’t embellish anything, told it the way it was.” 

That made this document all the more legitimate, in Fitzgerald’s eyes, and 
more sensational. “I’m very shocked.” He argued that Bugliosi, who was 
“extremely deceitful” and “the robot he claimed his defendants were,” had 
written “a script for the entire trial,” getting witnesses to agree to his narrative 
in advance. 

I was relieved by Fitzgerald’s astonishment—it convinced me that I 
wasn’t overreacting here. Wanting to eliminate any possible doubt, I tried for 
months to find Danny DeCarlo himself, but he seemed to have vanished. I did 


eventually track down a girlfriend of his, who told me that she’d gotten my 
interview request to him—he lived mainly in Mexico these days, she said. I 
never heard back from him. 

I felt it was becoming nearly impossible to deny that Bugliosi had 
manipulated some of his witnesses—or that he’d conspired with at least two 
of his principals to conceal the facts of the case and shore up his motive. If 
Melcher and DeCarlo were tainted—and if Melcher had committed outright 
perjury, suborned by Bugliosi—then the veracity of the prosecutor’s entire 
case, including the extraordinary hippie/race-war motive that made him a 
bestselling author, was called into question. 


“The Guy Is Psychotic” 


As one of the biggest bands in the world, the Beach Boys employed a retinue 
of managers, roadies, engineers, and gofers—I wondered if any of them had 
any thoughts on Wilson and Melcher, or if they could fill in some blanks for 
me. (The band’s surviving members had all declined to speak to me.) I got in 
touch with John Parks, who’d been the band’s tour manager when Manson 
and the Family lived at Wilson’s place. He recalled that Melcher had not only 
met Manson but recorded him, too. 

“Terry recorded him while we were on a fairly long tour,” Parks told me. 
That was something else Melcher had expressly denied on the stand, 
something hidden for all these decades. Bugliosi repeated it in his closing 
statement: “He did not record Manson.” 

When Melcher moved to end his professional relationship with Manson, 
things took a dark turn. As Parks remembered it, Manson began calling 
Melcher and unloading on him, making death threats against him “to 
everybody he saw”; he was “yelling about it and stuff.” Parks could certainly 
understand, he said, how those threats could’ve influenced Melcher’s 
decision to move out of the Cielo house so suddenly. 

After the murders, I asked, did Parks or any of his colleagues suspect 
Manson? Of course, he said. “I knew that Terry had kind of fired Charlie and 
stopped recording him, so my first thought was that Charlie had made a 
mistake and actually got Sharon Tate instead of Terry.” One of Manson’s 
girls, he explained, had already told him that the Family had murdered one of 


the caretakers at the Spahn Ranch—Donald “Shorty” Shea, whose body 
wasn’t found until 1977. 

“You could look at these folks and see that they were totally drugged 
out,” Parks said. “After one of the girls told me that they killed the caretaker, 
then it got real serious for me.” Everyone in their scene suspected Manson 
right away, he said, even though it took the LAPD nearly four months to 
bring him to justice. “I have no idea why they didn’t arrest him right away 
because to me it was pretty obvious.” The Hollywood community knew that 
the Beach Boys had been wrapped up in Manson’s world, and it turned them 
into pariahs, for a time; nightclubs where they’d once been welcomed were 
suddenly turning them away. “We couldn’t go out because people didn’t 
want us at their place,” Parks said. 

“So you’re saying a huge community of people knew before the world did 
that Charles Manson committed these murders?” 

“Yeah.” 

Parks went on to say something even more dizzying: he was positive that 
the FBI had sent agents to the Beach Boys’ office soon after the murders. 
“They were monitoring our phones, because they thought there was some 
connection with those guys,” he said. “They were sitting in my office picking 
up my telephone... I’m sure they had the phones tapped, but they weren’t 
sharing information with us.” He told the FBI about Manson “early on,” but 
they didn’t seem to act on his tip. “I didn’t know why they weren’t doing 
anything, and everybody else was just trying to stay out of the situation. For 
the Beach Boys, we didn’t want that kind of publicity. And neither did 
anybody else.” 

Steve Despar, the Beach Boys’ recording engineer, remembered the 
ordeal that Manson had put him through during the recording sessions, when 
he’d show up with “about twelve girls, many underage, quiet, in a stupor.” 
The group smelled so foul that the studio’s management, at the behest of 
Brian Wilson’s wife, soon “installed a sanitary bathroom seat.” In the control 
room, Manson, reeking, would “pull out a knife and clean his fingernails, 
wave it around and gesture.” After three sessions, Despar was fed up. He 
called the Beach Boys manager and said, “I refuse to be alone with him. The 
guy is psychotic and scares the hell out of me.” Despar emphasized, “He was 
after Melcher... Melcher was not out of the picture at this point. He was part 
of the project. When I was recording Charles Manson, it was for Dennis and 


Terry Melcher.” 


“For a Layperson” 


Melcher would never admit that, and I didn’t want to talk to him again until 
Pd done my due diligence. Fortunately, in the archives of the L.A. County 
Sheriff’s Office (LASO), I soon stumbled on further proof that Melcher had 
visited Manson after the murders. 

LASO had records of an interview with Paul Watkins, another key 
member of the Family who’d testified against Manson. He, too, saw Melcher 
at the Spahn Ranch, around the same time as Danny DeCarlo had—the first 
week of September 1969. What he told the unnamed interviewer was 
shocking to me: 


Melcher was on acid. Was on his knees. Asked Manson to forgive him. 
Terry Melcher failed to keep an appointment. Called him a pig. They 
are all little piggies. Helter Skelter meant for everyone to die. Charlie 
gave Gregg [Jakobson] a 45 slug and said give Dennis [Wilson] this 
and tell him I have another one for him. 


This was even more explosive than the files from the DA, I realized. Not only 
did it suggest that Melcher had some bizarre debt to Manson—it opened up 
Watkins to accusations of perjury. Just like DeCarlo, Watkins had omitted 
these details from his testimony. He made no mention of having seen 
Melcher at the Spahn Ranch in early September 1969—much less having 
seen him on acid, begging for forgiveness. 

As much as the Watkins interview buttressed my case for a cover-up, it 
brought a host of new questions. Why did Melcher need Manson’s 
forgiveness? Did he know that it was he who was supposed to die that night 
—had Manson instilled much more fear in him than anyone had ever known? 
And what had compelled Bugliosi to believe that he could hide the true extent 
of their relationship? I wondered how many other stories like this had been 
kept secret. Now I felt I had a stronger shot at grabbing Melcher’s attention, 
maybe even at getting him to concede that he’d lied. 

First, though, I had to contend with Bugliosi. As the summer faded into 


autumn in the first year of my reporting, I had a hunch that Vince was 
keeping close tabs on me, even monitoring my progress, in a way. Altobelli 
had suggested that Vince was always asking about me, trying to undermine 
my credibility; he thought I was only masquerading as a magazine journalist. 
When I heard about Melcher’s puzzling remark—‘“Vince was supposed to 
take care of all that’—I’d made a conscious decision to distance myself from 
Bugliosi. Although we’d once spoken on an almost weekly basis, I hadn’t 
been in touch with him since June. One day in October I came home to find 
that he’d left a message on my machine. “I need to talk to you about 
something,” he said, sounding unusually serious. This was it, I thought. I set 
up my tape recorder and called him back. 

“How you doing, buddy?” he answered, sounding manic. “Listen, are you 
still working on this thing?” Then he added: “Someone, I don’t remember 
who, called me... If there’s something about my handling of the case— 
anything at all—that you had a question about, I would appreciate if you 
would call me to get my view on it... I think I did a fairly good job, and I 
can’t think of things that I would do differently. But for a layperson, they 
may look at it and say, He should not have done this, this is improper or what 
have you—and I’d like to at least be heard.” 

I told him I would absolutely give him a chance to be heard, and that I 
did, in fact, have some questions—but I didn’t have them ready yet. 

“Okay,” he said. “Yeah, call me, because there may be a justification or 
reason why I did something that, as a layperson, you would not know.” 

Now I was positive that he had some notion of what I’d been researching, 
whom I’d been talking to. I mentioned that I’d made halting progress on the 
piece, which was still expected for Premiere, even if it was running behind 
schedule. The Melcher angle, I said—wondering if he’d take the bait—had 
been so impossible to get. 

“Were you ever able to get in touch with Terry?” he asked. 

I said I was. 

“Oh, you have talked to him? You got him on the phone?” Vince’s 
surprise was evident, but I couldn’t tell if it was feigned or not. I felt like he 
was hoping to keep me talking, to feel out my progress. I got off the phone as 
soon as I could. 

I didn’t hear from him again until December, just a few days before 
Christmas, when he left a phone message asking for my address. He said he 


wanted to send me a CD of some songs by Manson that “a guy playing 
Manson in a movie” had given him. When I didn’t return the call, he left 
another message the next day to make sure I understood that the music was 
“very rare and not otherwise available.” I didn’t return that call, either, but 
the same night I got a call from Altobelli, who said that Vince had called him 
twice that day “wanting to know what you’re doing.” Their second 
conversation ended in “a shouting match,” Altobelli said, after he started 
asking Bugliosi about some of the information I’d shared over the previous 
months. 

That was enough for me. I wouldn’t speak to Vince again for seven years. 


On Melcher’s Roof 


When my piece for Premiere was more than a year late, I knew I had to talk 
to Melcher again, and to put my full weight on him. I wanted this 
conversation to bring my reporting to a close. Then I could file my piece, 
finally. 

Months of constant interviewing had honed my strategy. If I could get 
someone on the phone in a talkative mood, I’d suggest an in-person meeting 
that same day, which would minimize the chance that they’d get cold feet. I’d 
be ready to go at a moment’s notice: showered and dressed, with notes, 
questions, documents, and tape recorders in my bag by the door. Such was 
the case on the day I phoned Melcher—July 3, 2000. Surprisingly, he picked 
up; even more surprisingly, I caught him in a lively frame of mind; most 
surprising of all, he said he’d meet me on the roof of his apartment building 
in fifteen minutes. 

I bolted out the door and drove over to his high-rise on Ocean Avenue, in 
Santa Monica, dwelling all the while on his choice of venue: his rooftop? I 
imagined some kind of bleak, desolate place, the sun beating down on us as 
ventilation fans whirred. Instead, I bounded into his lobby and took the 
elevator up to find a rooftop lounge with a bar, a pool, and a kingly view of 
the Santa Monica Bay. 

Melcher lived in one of the penthouse suites, and there he was, sitting on a 
couch with a drink in his hand. Though it was a gorgeous day and anyone in 
these luxury suites could access the roof lounge, we were alone up there. He 


was wearing a gold shirt and aviator glasses that he didn’t take off until 
midway through our conversation. When I arrived, he disappeared into his 
kitchen to leave his drink there. I got the sense it wasn’t the first he’d had. 

Considering how much time and energy I’d devoted to Melcher, I 
couldn’t believe I’d never laid eyes on him before. He had a pronounced 
abdomen but skinny legs. His long, wispy, blond-gray hair fell over his ears 
and across his forehead. His face was swollen and wet, with high 
cheekbones; his eyes, when the sunglasses came off, were puffy, and he 
stared at me unsmilingly. Around the mouth and chin, he resembled his 
mother, Doris Day. And he spoke in a kind of high-pitched, halting half- 
whisper. 

We sat in the shade, where I took my papers out and told him I had reason 
to believe he’d visited the Spahn and Barker Ranches after the murders, and 
had spent time with Manson. 

“The only reason I know the Barker Ranch name is because that’s where 
they arrested them and caught all those people,” he said. “Isn’t that right? 
Someplace out in the middle of the Mojave Desert?” 

“Dennis and Gregg had been there,” I said. 

“Well, I hadn’t. I had no idea where the Barker Ranch was. None.” 

I started to read from Bugliosi’s interview with Danny DeCarlo, the one 
Pd gotten from the DA’s office. “‘Definitely saw Melcher out at ranch. Heard 
girls say, “Terry’s coming, Terry’s coming.” Melcher drove up in a Metro 
truck similar to a bread or milk truck...’” 

“Tt was actually a Mercedes Benz convertible.” 

“This is after the murders,” I emphasized. “Between August 16 and the 
second week of September. Do you recall that?” I watched the frustration 
come over him as I explained. 

“Look,” he said, rubbing the bridge of his nose. “Obviously this is 
something that continues to haunt me whether I’d like it to or not, and I’m 
not exactly like a convicted felon running around doing bad things. But the 
only guy to talk to and ask questions about for me is Bugliosi. Vince Bugliosi 
knows everything that I had to do with this, everything!” 

“T wanted to hear it from you first before I went to him,” I said. 

“Well, you know, if you want to fuck with us and get something from him 
and something from me, you can do that, too, in which case Pll put four law 
firms on Premiere magazine.” 


I was floored. We’d barely begun, and already he was threatening to sue. 
The threats, as I was beginning to understand by then, were almost always a 
good thing. They didn’t happen unless you were onto something. “I just want 
the truth, Terry,” I said. “Can I just finish reading from this?” 

“You certainly may, Tom. I have never misrepresented once what 
happened in this situation. I had nothing to do with this situation other than 
the fact that I was a great big, famous record producer at the time, period.” 

Pressing ahead, I pulled out the LASO files, and soon reached the most 
damning lines: “Melcher was on acid, on his knees.” 

“Not true!” he shouted. “Not real! Hey, I was a Columbia Records 
producer! I was the biggest Columbia Records producer on the West Coast! I 
had the Byrds, Paul Revere and the Raiders, all right? I was selling tonnage 
of product. I was simply looking at acts... I went out there to the Spahn 
Ranch, met them, I am awfully goddamned lucky to have gotten out of there 
alive.” He adamantly refuted the idea that he’d been to the Spahn Ranch more 
than the two times he’d testified to at trial, both in May 1969. 

“Rudi [Altobelli] is one of my sources,” I said. “He called you and you 
said, ‘Vince was supposed to take care of all that and now it’s all 
resurfacing.’” 

“No, I never told Rudi that... I like Rudi, we were friends, I hope there’s 
no rancor.” He scoffed and crossed his arms. “And Christ, what are you 
doing a thing like this for?” 

“T’m just trying to get the truth about this story, and when I see this stuff 
from the DA’s files and combined with that comment from Rudi, which 
implies that Vince protected you—” 

“Vince never protected me. Vince never protected anybody. Rudi was the 
guy—” But he cut himself off and sighed. “I got to use the men’s room,” he 
said, walking back toward his place. 

He came back having collected himself. “I’m going to digress for a 
while,” he said, removing his sunglasses. “First of all, if you want my record 
as it relates to this, it is so squeaky clean—all I did was audition people for 
Columbia Records. Some of them I signed. Some of them I didn’t sign. I 
never once spent one second with these girls, although at one point, when 
they were in jail, like twenty-five of them said that I was the father of all their 
children, and that put me in bed for about three weeks. I mean, they were so 
ugly. To get the DA’s department off my ass in that one, I took Michelle 


Phillips”—his girlfriend at the time, during the trial—‘“down to headquarters 
and I said, ‘This is my girlfriend, do you think I’d want to be with any of 
these...”” He gestured, implying Manson’s “ugly” girls. “And they said, 
probably not.” 

I reminded him of what Altobelli had said: “On the stand, he said that you 
wanted him to manage Manson.” 

“That is total insanity... This is really my book, okay?... You know what? 
If I’m going to do this with you, then we should write this book together.” It 
was almost a bargaining chip, an under-the-table deal. I thought Melcher 
wanted me to read between the lines—why say all these nasty things about 
me in a silly little magazine piece when I can cut you in on the earnings from 
my book? He proposed that I coauthor his memoirs. People had been begging 
him for years to write a book. He was the “only American to produce the 
Beatles!” He seemed to suggest that I’d be a fool not to jump at his offer, 
even though I was the same writer who believed he’d been lying about one of 
the most transformative events of his life. 

“I need to do this story, and I need the truth,” I said. “You were a 
powerful guy—” 

“Was? Am.” He asked, “Is your interest in this purely journalistic or is it 
just to fuck someone over?” 

I stressed, again, that I had no desire to smear him; I just wanted to know 
why these files told such a strikingly different story from the one Bugliosi 
had pursued. 

“Dennis Wilson was the only one that really knew what was going on,” 
Melcher said. “He’s talked about it in various ways that sounds like he knew 
all about it, he was there.” Melcher seemed put upon by the effort of 
discussing Manson, as if it were a minor nuisance that he’d long ago put 
behind him. “After a while you get used to it, it’s a terrible thing to say, but 
you kind of get used to it.” And then, once more, he acted like he was ready 
to cut a deal. “So what’s the best thing that you and I can do about it?” 

The interview suddenly had the air of a tense negotiation. “There has to be 
an explanation for this,” I said, turning the conversation back to the papers 
from the DA and LASO. “Why was this in the files? How was it suppressed, 
why? If they were lying’—DeCarlo and Watkins, I meant—“how did they 
testify to other significant factors?” 

“T have no idea where that second ranch is,” Melcher said. “I have no idea 


in the world! It could be in Kuwait.” He rose to get a bottle of white wine, 
half-full, and poured himself a drink. “You’re welcome to share that, by the 
way,” he said. He’d brought only one glass. 

“Tf it is true that you were at the ranch after the murders, it undermines the 
entire Helter Skelter motive for the prosecution,” I said. 

“Pm curious why you would want to talk to me about this,” he said, 
almost muttering: “out to crucify me...” 

“Because nobody’s ever had this information that I have, about you at the 
ranch afterward.” 

At that point, Melcher dropped his lawyer’s name. “Joe Lavely. Do you 
know who he is? He can shut down everything. Networks, magazines. 
Anything.” He asked me to fax him a draft of my story. I told him I couldn’t 
do that. 

Melcher leaned forward. “You know I like you,” he said, looking me in 
the eye. “If I didn’t like you, I’d take your briefcase and throw it off the 
balcony. Okay? I happen to like you, so I hope you’|l be fair.” 

“That sounds like a threat,” I said. “But I will be fair with you.” 

“That’s not a threat, it’s the truth.” 

It was the truth, of course, that Melcher had the means to follow through. 
He could try to sue me or Premiere. He could leap up and toss my papers— 
all photocopies—off his rooftop. But I wondered what he would really do. As 
unnerving as it was to sit across from him, getting no admissions from him 
whatsoever, I stayed calm by wondering what form his antagonism could 
possibly take, considering I was confident I had solid reporting on him. 

“I know you have money, resources, powerful lawyers,” I said, aware that 
the interview was next to over. “But that’s not going to stop me from writing 
my story, and there is no way you can shut it down with all of that, because it 
is the truth, and you can’t shut down the truth, Terry.” 

And soon I was in the elevator and on the ground again, looking up at his 
building in the sun. I felt the mix of exhilaration and frustration that often 
followed my biggest interviews, when I felt Pd made headway in some 
unpredictable direction. No, I hadn’t cracked Melcher, but I had his bizarre 
behavior to report, his threats, his offer that I coauthor his life story, and, 
perhaps most important, the first on-the-record answers about Charles 
Manson he’d given since 1974. What I still didn’t know was when, or how, 
all of this was going to end. 


Coda: “They Used to Call Me an Angel” 


I never saw or spoke to Melcher again. He died in 2004, at age sixty-two, of 
cancer. To my knowledge, he never gave another interview about Manson or 
wrote his memoirs. 

His death foreclosed the possibility of learning so much about the Family: 
about their true motivations for the murders, their ties to the Hollywood elite, 
and their ability to go undiscovered for so many months after their grisly 
crimes. I remain convinced that Melcher had more of the answers than he let 
on, and that he cast himself as a bit player in Manson’s world when his role 
was much larger. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to explain the discrepancies in 
his story to my satisfaction. 

After my confrontation with him that day, I turned my attention elsewhere 
—though even from a remove, Melcher and his cohort continued to pop up in 
my reporting. And because of how tantalizingly close I felt Pd been to 
unearthing something, I couldn’t stop from ruminating on some of the 
questions I’d had about him. Why had he moved out of 10050 Cielo Drive? 
Did he ever record Manson? What was his true relationship with Tex Watson 
and Dean Moorehouse? Most of all, was it possible he could have prevented 
the murders at the house through some kind of intervention with Manson, or 
by warning the victims—or just by calling the police? 

With Melcher and Dennis Wilson both deceased, you might be 
wondering: Why not get some answers from that third and final Golden 
Penetrator, Gregg Jakobson? I did end up finding him. Actually, we spoke 
well before I ever got to Melcher, in the first months of my reporting—before 
I knew my way around the story well enough to push back on some of his 
claims. 

In a sense, Jakobson is more mysterious than Melcher or Wilson. Unlike 
those two, he didn’t come from privilege. An orphan, he was adopted by the 
chief of police in St. Paul, Minnesota; when he was twelve, his adoptive 
father died, and he moved with his mother to Los Angeles, where he was 
soon rubbing elbows with the sons and daughters of celebrities. He parlayed 
these connections into a career on the periphery of Hollywood, taking gigs as 
a stuntman, an actor, and a talent scout, and racking up a few arrests along 


the way. But it was his past that attracted Manson to him. As an orphan, 
Jakobson held a special place in the Family’s mythology. Manson loathed the 
influence of parents, and Jakobson, despite his adopted family, was held up 
as a parentless icon. “They used to call me an angel,” Jakobson told me, 
“because I came into the world without parents.” 

Dennis Wilson’s biographer John Stebbins believed Jakobson “testified to 
protect Wilson from having to do the same.” Wilson gave Jakobson cowriting 
credits—and therefore a steady stream of royalties—on many of his songs, 
even though Jakobson “had no idea what he was doing” in the studio, where 
it seemed he “didn’t know a guitar string from a piano key.” 

In 1999, Jakobson wanted one hundred bucks an hour to talk to me. When 
I made it clear that I wouldn’t pay him, he claimed that the passage of thirty 
years had fogged up his memory. Jakobson contradicted himself with 
nonchalance. Consider the theft of the green spyglass, for instance. This was 
a huge point in the trial: Jakobson testified that Manson had called him before 
the murders, asking him if Melcher had a “green spyglass” at his new address 
in Malibu. When Jakobson said yes, Manson responded, “He doesn’t 
anymore.” This proved that Manson knew that Melcher had moved out of the 
Cielo house. And yet, speaking to me, Jakobson dismissed the whole episode. 
“T don’t know how much of that is legend and how much of it is true,” he 
said about something he’d testified to under oath. “I think there was a good 
chance that [Manson] didn’t know that Melcher had even moved.” I’ve found 
dozens of discrepancies between his statements on the stand and his 
statements to me. 

Sometimes, sorting through old news items, I’ll chance upon something 
that reminds me of how much remains unsaid here. I found a November 1970 
bulletin from the Associated Press, headlined, “Defendant in Tate Trial Well 
Liked.” It noted the curious affection that Melcher and Jakobson held for the 
man who’d brought so much scrutiny on them. “Jakobson frequently smiled 
at Manson,” the report noted, “who, upon leaving the courtroom one day, 
said to Jakobson, ‘Come see me.’” What are we supposed to make of that 
friendliness, and of the insider knowledge it augurs? Why would Manson 
have wanted to commune with someone who’d just testified against him in a 
case that carried the death penalty? Manson’s lawyer Irving Kanarek chose 
not to cross-examine Terry Melcher. He infuriated the judge by saying that 
Manson and Melcher were “still good friends,” and that he wanted to “thank 


Mr. Melcher for his presence”—comments that earned him admonishment 
from the court, and were ordered stricken from the record. 

Jakobson told me that he never really took Manson all that seriously. 
“There was so much bullshit,” he said. “I never tried to make sense out of it. I 
didn’t care.” He left open the possibility that there’d been some scheming to 
make the story more presentable at trial. “I wonder if Bugliosi was doing 
Melcher a favor,” he said to me, “or there was some reciprocity there... 
honest to God, I have no knowledge of it.” He was a little more willing to 
talk about Melcher’s attraction to the girls in the Family. “He might have 
been carrying on with one of the girls,” he told me, though Melcher had 
fiercely denied exactly that. “I had a soft spot for little Ruth Ann 
Moorehouse. He might have, too. She was the little gem of the group. Little 
sweet fifteen, sixteen.” Likewise, Jeff Guinn’s 2013 book Manson includes 
several references to Melcher’s having sex with Ruth Ann Moorehouse, all 
sourced to Jakobson. 

Melcher always policed his image in regards to Manson, especially when 
others implied or wrote outright that he’d slept with the girls. Nothing made 
him more litigious. And he often subjected writers to the same kinds of legal 
threats he’d made to me. Barney Hoskyns, the author of the aforementioned 
Waiting for the Sun, told me that Melcher’s lawyers had ordered his publisher 
to pulp all existing copies of the first edition, and to delete “all and any 
references to Terry Melcher in connection with ‘Manson’s girls’ from any 
future editions.” His publisher complied. 

But the most glaring example of Melcher’s interventions came from 
Stephen Kay, the attorney in the Los Angeles DA’s office who’d helped 
Bugliosi prosecute the case. He told me that Melcher’s lawyer approached 
him in the mid-1990s, requesting that he sign an official document certifying 
that Melcher’s connections with the Family didn’t extend beyond his three 
occasions in Manson’s presence: once at Wilson’s house, twice at the Spahn 
Ranch. Kay signed it, though he said he hadn’t retained a copy. At the time, 
he hadn’t seen the documents I had detailing Melcher’s relationship with the 
Family. 


One of the most bewildering parts of reporting on a case like this is figuring 
out how much weight to give your findings. I spent years wondering if I was 


crazy to think that Terry Melcher was so important, indicative of some 
hollowness in Bugliosi’s motive. 

Years later, in 2005, it was Kay who gave me a semblance of vindication. 
I met with him again and showed him the notes I’d found in Bugliosi’s hand. 
By that point, my obsession with the case had become a full-blown mania: 
my reporting had taken over my entire life, and I often wondered if there 
would be any end to it, any form of closure or consequence. I can still 
remember sitting in Kay’s Compton office and watching him shake his head 
as he looked over my photocopies. 

“I do not believe that Terry Melcher was at the Spahn Ranch after the 
murders. I just don’t believe that,” he said. “If he was there at the Spahn 
Ranch, Manson would have harmed him, because Manson was very upset.” 

But with the sheaf of papers in front of him, and the handwriting 
undeniably belonging to Bugliosi, Kay slumped in his chair. “I am shocked,” 
he said. “I am just shocked.” He was planning his retirement then, having 
boasted that he was leaving office “sixty and zero”: sixty court appearances 
opposite Family members, without a single one of them earning parole. With 
the evidence of Bugliosi’s corruption in his hands, Kay said, “This throws a 
different light on everything... I just don’t know what to believe now.” He 
went on: “This is egregious conduct if this happened. All of this should have 
been turned over to the defense.” 

The fact that Paul Watkins and Danny DeCarlo told similar stories seemed 
to indicate that both men were telling the truth, impeaching Melcher’s 
testimony and, with it, much of the basis for the Helter Skelter motive. 
Looking at the heavy lines that Vince had drawn through the most damning 
parts of the interviews, Kay said, “I just don’t understand the cross-outs... it 
just doesn’t make any sense.” 

His voice trailing off, he asked the question I’d so often asked myself. “If 
Vince was covering this stuff up,” he said, “if he changed this, what else did 
he change?” 

I asked Kay whether this evidence would be enough to overturn the 
verdicts against Manson and the Family. Yes, he conceded—it could get 
them new trials, and it would mean big trouble for Bugliosi. If he were found 
guilty of suborning perjury, he would technically be eligible for the death 
penalty, since that was the maximum possible sentence in the Manson case. 

I wasn’t on some crusade to prove Manson innocent, or to impugn 


Bugliosi’s name. I just wanted to find out what really happened. Kay, sitting 
across from me that day, seemed to be struggling with the same thing. 
Neither of us could grasp why Bugliosi had covered this up, or how Melcher 
and his friends had, for so many years, consigned the truth to the realm of 
rumor and hearsay. 

I felt a familiar conflict welling up inside me. Part of me was convinced 
that if I kept pushing, if I were more tenacious and vigilant and hard-nosed 
than ever before, I could crack this case and figure it all out. The other part of 
me feared that I was too late. Powerful interests had aligned themselves 
against the truth.

Amnesia at the L.A. County Sheriff’s 
Office 


“Keep Going” 


The thirtieth anniversary of the Tate—LaBianca murders passed with no story, 
at least not in Premiere. That didn’t worry me—not at first, anyway. I knew 
that Jim Meigs, the magazine’s editor in chief, shared my obsession. He 
started leaving the due date blank on the contracts I had to sign every month: 
a reporter’s dream come true, until it wasn’t. 

Within a year, I’d interviewed more than five hundred people: movie- 
industry players, friends and relatives of the victims, witnesses, journalists, 
cops, attorneys, judges, suspects, and hangers-on. My one-bedroom 
apartment in Venice had become a hoarder’s nest of Manson ephemera. I 
installed shelves above my desk to house a growing collection of books and 
binders—I bought the thickest ones I could find—with labels like “News 
Clips—1967-1969,” “Timelines,” “Trial ‘Transcripts,’ “Questions— 
Witnesses,” and so on. They multiplied as if they were breeding. When my 
friends visited, they’d stop in their tracks upon entering my apartment and 
cast worried glances my way. Above my computer was a whiteboard with 
“MANSON” circled in the center. Springing from his name like a 
psychedelic spiderweb were lines in erasable ink, leading to associates of the 
Family who’d never been publicly identified before, Hollywood drug dealers, 
and other names that had seldom been uttered in three decades. 

I tried to interview as many people as I could in a day, so my workdays 


became endless. I was always behind, needing to hop in my battered Acura to 
drive to the Valley or San Diego or Santa Barbara for an interview at a 
moment’s notice. When I wasn’t interviewing, I was researching, arranging 
my binders, or working the phones to set up more interviews. I’d basically 
adopted my neighbor’s German shepherd, Bully, who spent day and night at 
my house; I sometimes worried my files could be stolen, and I felt safer with 
the dog by my side. 

My magazine assignment was coming to feel like a vocation. Manson and 
the theories surrounding him were always on my mind, whether I was alone 
or with friends—though, in the hopes of wrapping up the story, I was alone 
much of the time. Since Meigs was authorizing my extensions, he would visit 
me on trips to L.A. We’d sit on the floor as I spread out documents for him to 
examine, kicking around various explanations for the discrepancies in the 
case. He was a reassuring presence; the things that seemed suspicious to me 
bothered him, too. As long as I had his confidence, I could keep putting in 
long hours. At that point, the end—the break, the big scoop—seemed just 
around the corner. Looking from a document to a name on my whiteboard, 
Jim would nod and say, “Yes, yes—I see. Good. Keep going.” And I did. 


“Political Piggy” 


The Tate—LaBianca murders are etched into the public imagination. They are, 
in casual conversation, what people mean when they say “the Manson 
murders”: two nights of unhinged bloodshed that came out of nowhere. 

It’s too often forgotten that the Family had taken another life by then. 
Gary Hinman, thirty-four, lived in a secluded house in Topanga Canyon, a 
hippie community about fifteen miles south of the Spahn Ranch. A soft- 
spoken Buddhist and music teacher, Hinman had treated Manson and his 
followers with a dignity that few afforded them. He hosted members of the 
Family for long stays in his home, and he was generous when they needed 
food or money. 

In July 1969, the increasingly agitated Manson was convinced that 
Hinman had just come into an inheritance of some twenty thousand dollars. 
Seeing green, he ordered three of his followers—Bobby Beausoleil, Mary 
Brunner, and Susan Atkins, the last of whom would later participate in the 


Tate-LaBianca murders—to seize Hinman’s money by any means necessary. 

The three showed up at Hinman’s on July 25. Manson was wrong, he said, 
there was no inheritance, but they refused to take him at his word. They tied 
him up and ransacked the place, but there was no cash to be found. Manson 
decided to see for himself, coming over with Bruce Davis, another Family 
member. But even Manson couldn’t extract anything from Hinman. Finally, 
incensed, Manson drew a saber from a sheath on his belt and cut Hinman’s 
ear in half. He and Davis left the house, but he told Beausoleil and the girls to 
stay until they found the money. 

For two days, they battered and tortured Hinman, who insisted he had no 
inheritance. (They also sewed up his severed ear using dental floss.) By day 
three, Manson had had enough—he wanted Hinman dead. Over the phone, he 
ordered his followers to take care of it. Beausoleil tied Hinman up and 
stabbed him at least four times. As Hinman incanted a Buddhist prayer, 
Atkins and Brunner took turns holding a pillow over his face until he stopped 
breathing. Just as Manson would do in the Tate-LaBianca murders, he told 
his followers to leave signs implicating the Black Panthers. They dipped a rag 
in Hinman’s blood and smeared the words “political piggy” on the living 
room wall, surrounding it with bloody paw prints. 

Some of Hinman’s friends grew concerned. On July 31, not having heard 
from him in six days, they drove over to check on him. They found his body 
and called the cops. 

Charles Guenther and Paul Whiteley, homicide detectives from the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff’s Office, went to investigate. They spent five days 
searching the crime scene for evidence and conducting interviews. Although 
no one had seen or spoken to Hinman in the days before his body was 
discovered, it seemed that a woman had been in his house answering the 
phone during his captivity. At one point, when a friend of Hinman stopped 
by, she’d even answered his front door, holding a candle and explaining in a 
flimsy British accent that Hinman had gone to Colorado to see his parents. 

The detectives issued an all-points bulletin for two vehicles missing from 
Hinman’s driveway: a Fiat station wagon and a VW microbus. Seven days 
after the body was discovered, the Fiat turned up on the side of a highway in 
San Luis Obispo, 189 miles north of L.A. Inside was Bobby Beausoleil, fast 
asleep. A state trooper took him into custody, and Guenther and Whiteley 
hurried to question him. 


Beausoleil had concocted a story that blamed the Black Panthers for the 
murder, but he kept muddling the details. First he said that he hadn’t known 
Hinman at all; he’d bought the Fiat from a Black Panther a few days earlier. 
When the police told him they’d found the murder weapon in the Fiat’s tire 
well, he half-confessed: sure, he’d been in Hinman’s home, but he hadn’t 
killed the man. He and two women, neither of whom he would identify, had 
arrived at the house to find Hinman bloodied and beaten, complaining that a 
group of Black Panthers had robbed him. They’d stayed and nursed Hinman 
back to health. As a sign of gratitude, Hinman gave them the Fiat. The 
murder, Beausoleil speculated, must have occurred after he and the girls left 
the house—maybe the Panthers had returned seeking more money. So why 
was the knife in his car? He couldn’t explain. Nor could he say why he’d 
suddenly changed his story. 

Guenther and Whiteley were confident they’d found their man. They 
charged Beausoleil with first-degree murder and booked him into the Los 
Angeles County jail on August 7. But they knew he had at least one 
accomplice: the girl who answered the phone and front door during Hinman’s 
Captivity. 

The next day, according to Bugliosi’s narrative, Manson decided it was 
time to kick off Helter Skelter, his all-out race war. He ordered the Tate— 
LaBianca murders, making sure, again, that his followers left signs at the 
crime scenes implicating the Black Panthers. 

Anyone might wonder: How could the police fail to connect Hinman’s 
murder to the Tate—LaBianca killings, given their macabre similarities? It’s a 
good question—and the official answer, even when I first read it in Helter 
Skelter, stretched credulity. Part of the problem was a simple matter of 
jurisdiction. The Hinman murder occurred outside the city limits of Los 
Angeles, so it was an L.A. County Sheriff’s (LASO) case; the Tate—LaBianca 
murders were handled by the LAPD. The two police forces didn’t talk as 
much as you might expect. In fact, as Bugliosi tells it, it was their failure to 
communicate that led them to overlook Manson in the first place. 

By August 10, the day after the LaBiancas had been murdered, Guenther 
and Whiteley had connected Hinman’s murder to Manson. They knew Bobby 
Beausoleil had spent time at the Spahn Ranch, living with a strange group 
under the control of an ex-con named Charlie. And, according to Bugliosi, 
the two detectives did the right thing: they rushed to the county morgue, 


where autopsies of the Cielo Drive murder victims were under way, and they 
reported their suspicions to the LAPD. A sergeant named Jess Buckles heard 
them out. Wasn’t it curious, they said, that both the Hinman and Tate 
murders involved brutal stabbings, plus some iteration of the word “Pig” 
smeared in the victims’ blood near their bodies? They explained that their 
suspect, Beausoleil, had been living out at a disused movie ranch with a band 
of hippies led by a guy who claimed to be Jesus Christ. 

Their theory fell on deaf ears. Sergeant Buckles didn’t see the connection 
—especially not if hippies were involved. He told the LASO detectives that 
they were barking up the wrong tree; the LAPD was already pretty sure that 
the Tate murders were a drug deal gone awry. 

And so, Bugliosi argued, the LASO lead withered on the vine, and shoddy 
police work kept the Manson Family at large for months longer than they 
otherwise would’ve been. They weren’t taken into custody until a pair of 
raids nabbed them on October 10 and 12. Even then, their arrest was for 
stolen vehicles: the police wouldn’t connect them to Tate—LaBianca for more 
than another month. While they were at large, Manson and the Family may 
have killed dozens more people, Bugliosi speculated. 

In the official narrative, Manson had a lot of sheer dumb luck. Not only 
did he evade these early suspicions against him—he also survived, ostensibly 
on a technicality, the largest police raid in the history of California. 


On August 16, 1969, LASO descended on the Spahn Ranch en masse. Just 
past six in the morning, as the sun was creeping up and most everyone was 
still asleep, more than one hundred officers swarmed the property, led by the 
organization’s elite SWAT team. Armed with handguns, AR-15 rifles, and 
tear gas, they were assisted by two helicopters, numerous ATVs, and a fleet 
of some thirty-five squad cars. Surrounding the ranch’s two hundred acres, 
they descended from five prearranged outposts with a show of force the likes 
of which no one in LASO had ever seen before. They arrested everyone in 
the Family—twenty-seven adults and seven juveniles. They confiscated 
seven stolen cars and a vast cache of weapons, including an automatic pistol 
and a submachine gun. One officer praised the raid’s military precision, 
telling me, “It was the most flawlessly executed operation I’d ever been 
involved in.” 


The raid had nothing to do with the murders. In the preceding weeks, 
deputies had been keeping the ranch under close surveillance, perhaps even 
sending undercover agents to investigate. They suspected that Manson was 
running an auto-theft ring out of Spahn, stealing Volkswagens and converting 
them into dune buggies. 

It would seem like a coup, wouldn’t it? Even if they had no knowledge of 
the murders, sheriffs had just picked up Manson and everyone involved with 
him on suspicion of crimes that were damning in their own right. Had the 
Family been formally charged, they would’ve been sitting in jail already 
when the cops realized they were behind the killings. 

But the Family wasn’t charged. Despite the preponderance of evidence— 
the cars, the guns, the numerous sightings of Manson and his followers with 
stolen vehicles—the entire group was released three days after the raid, no 
questions asked. Bugliosi explained it in Helter Skelter: “They had been 
arrested on a misdated warrant.” 

His book downplayed the size of the raid; you’d never know it was the 
biggest in the history of Los Angeles law enforcement at that time. He also 
took it as a given that Guenther and Whiteley, seasoned and widely respected 
detectives, would back away from a lead to the most prominent unsolved 
murder case in California history. It seemed to me that they wouldn’t do that 
unless they were told to. 

I wanted to get the story straight from Guenther and Whiteley. What they 
told me was, at the very least, the story of an agonizing series of coincidences 
and near misses, a comedy of errors that had never been given a proper 
airing. At most, it was the germ of an extensive cover-up by LASO, which 
moved to conceal either its own ineptitude or something more sinister: the 
hand of a higher authority, warning that pursuing Manson would come with 
steep consequences. 


“Leave a Sign” 


Paul Fitzgerald, the defense attorney, gave me Charlie Guenther’s number. 
Guenther was the most honest cop he knew; when he’d taken the liberty of 
telling the retired detective about my research, Guenther had said he might be 
able to help me. 


When I got Guenther on the phone, he already knew what he wanted to 
tell me—but he refused to say it. I had to come to his house, he said, more 
than a hundred miles away in Victorville, California. I tried to wrestle a hint 
out of him. Sounding exasperated, he said it had something to do with Bobby 
Beausoleil and “maybe a call that had been made.” After a pause, he added, 
“and the destruction of evidence.” 

The very next day, I made the two-hour drive to Victorville. If you’re 
driving from L.A. to Vegas, it’s just about the last place to fill up your tank 
before you’re surrounded by the endless vastness of the Mojave Desert. The 
town is an oasis of man-made lakes and sprawling golf clubs, all catering to 
the community’s many retirees—among them, Charlie Guenther, who 
welcomed me into his new condo dressed in a white T-shirt and shorts. I sat 
on an overstuffed couch beneath a framed painting of a forlorn Jesus in 
prayer at Gethsemane. Guenther sank into a large recliner, though he was 
seldom relaxed enough to stay in it for long. 

Guenther was famous among true-crime devotees—he’d become 
something of a staple in the genre, his skilled investigative work having 
solved a number of notable murders. His better-known cases included the 
Cotton Club murders and the 1958 killing of the author James Ellroy’s 
mother. Guenther never solved that crime, but Ellroy still hailed him, in My 
Dark Places, as one of the best homicide detectives ever to work in L.A. 
Most everyone who wrote about Guenther noted his penetrating blue eyes, 
his unruly mop of hair—now gone white—and his stocky build. 

Listening to him talk, I could see why Guenther was so highly regarded— 
but that day he was also nervous, jumpy. He wouldn’t let me tape our 
conversation, saying that “smart cops” never allow themselves to be 
recorded. As the words came spilling out of him, I tried to get his every 
utterance on paper while appearing nonchalant, lest he become even more 
inhibited. 

He remembered going to the Tate autopsies with his partner, Whiteley, to 
tell the investigators about the similarities between the Hinman murder and 
the Tate murders. The coroner, Thomas Noguchi, had already reached the 
same conclusion: they must be connected. “I know Charlie, I know,” 
Noguchi told him. “Same knife. Same wound. Same blood on the wall.” But 
the LAPD detectives weren’t nearly as receptive. They were “convinced it 
had something to do with narcotics,” Guenther said. 


I turned the conversation to Bobby Beausoleil. The mere mention of his 
name launched Guenther out of his recliner: “He lies, and I can’t tell you how 
I know that.” 

Of course he lies, I said. Didn’t all murderers? 

“He called the ranch after he was arrested,” Guenther said, pacing in front 
of me. To his mind, it was this phone call that had initiated the Tate— 
LaBianca murders. “The sole motive for those murders was to get Bobby out 
of jail.” 

Pd heard this before—the copycat theory of the murders. Bugliosi had 
discredited it, I reminded him. That name didn’t sit well with him, either. 

“Arrogant son of a bitch!” he shouted. “Vince didn’t want anything to do 
with the Hinman case. Hinman was a nothing case. Vince didn’t want to 
prosecute it.” 

So Guenther didn’t buy into the Helter Skelter motive? He absolutely 
didn’t, he said, sinking back into his recliner. He thought Bugliosi “made up” 
the motive to sell books. No one in law enforcement believed it, either, he 
added. As soon as the Family’s Linda Kasabian flipped and became a 
prosecution witness, the entire motive for the murders changed. Guenther 
slouched in his chair, his great paw of a hand rubbing his forehead. 

When Beausoleil called the ranch from jail, according to Guenther “he 
said, “Tell Charlie I’ve been arrested for killing Hinman.’” Guenther was sure 
about this, because there was a recording of Beausoleil’s call. Knowing that 
he had accomplices in the Hinman murder, police had tapped the phone at the 
men’s jail and recorded the calls he made. On August 8, the day after he was 
booked, Beausoleil called the Spahn Ranch and told the person on the other 
end, allegedly Linda Kasabian, that he’d been arrested for Hinman’s murder. 
“T need help,” he was heard telling her. “Leave a sign.” 

That night, Sharon Tate and her friends were killed, and Susan Atkins 
scrawled the word “Pig” in blood on the front door of the Cielo house, just as 
she’d done on the wall at Hinman’s. Guenther believed this was the “sign” 
Beausoleil referred to—Atkins hoped to exonerate Beausoleil, since he was 
in jail when the Tate—LaBianca murders had taken place. Manson’s followers 
were, in effect, imitating themselves on a more devastating scale just to free 
one of their own. After that, they could escape to the desert. 

Essentially, the wiretap was the best evidence yet for the copycat theory 
of the murders, and Guenther had never told anyone about it. He was visibly 


anxious to get it off his chest after thirty years, sometimes shaking in his seat. 
But he worried that it would overturn the verdicts against the convicted 
killers. “I don’t want this reversed after all these years!” he said, pounding his 
fist on the arm of his chair. 

Guenther’s intensity moved me—he seemed on the verge of tears. But I 
couldn’t figure out why he’d decided to reveal the recordings now, after all 
these decades. And why to me? Surely other journalists had sniffed around 
before. I asked if he had a copy of the tape. No such luck. Because the 
wiretap was illegal, his commanding officer, Captain George Walsh, had 
ordered him and Whiteley to turn over the recording; Walsh apparently 
destroyed it, or made sure that someone else did. 

But if any of this was going into my Premiere story, Guenther didn’t want 
to go on the record alone about it. He needed someone else to say it with him, 
someone who could verify the tape’s authenticity—ideally, someone from the 
other side of law enforcement. He named Aaron Stovitz, who’d been 
Bugliosi’s coprosecutor for part of the trial. Stovitz had heard the tape. 
Guenther was sure of that—the detective had brought it to him before it was 
destroyed. 

“Get Stovitz to say it,” he urged me, tears welling in his eyes again. “Say, 
Charlie Guenther gave me this reluctantly. Say I owned up after a long 
conversation and did it reluctantly. Ask him, how can it hurt? Promise me, 
promise me! I don’t want them all back out on the street, and I’m worried this 
will do it!” 

I promised him. But I still didn’t understand why Walsh had destroyed the 
tape. Even if it were illegal, it so clearly solved the Tate—LaBianca murders— 
the day after they occurred, at that. “He said it would eliminate the narcotics 
angle,” Guenther told me. 

That startled me. Why would Walsh, who wasn’t involved in the LAPD 
investigation, want them to pursue what he now knew was a false lead? 


Talking to Guenther reminded me of something in an old issue of Rolling 
Stone. Aaron Stovitz had given an interview to the magazine in June 1970, 
right before the trial started. He mentioned exactly the phone call that 
Guenther had just told me about, though he’d couched it in more uncertain 
terms. Using the pseudonym “Porfiry,” and speaking in the present tense, 


Stovitz told Rolling Stone that Bobby Beausoleil “puts a phone call in at the 
ranch telling them that he was arrested there and telling them he hasn’t said 
anything”: 


Now—this is only a supposition on my part, I don’t have any proof to 
support it—I suppose he, meaning Manson, said to himself, “How am 
I going to help my friend Beausoleil out? By showing that the actual 
murderer of Hinman is still at large. So I know that Melcher used to 
live in this house on Cielo Drive. ‘Go out there, Watson, with these 
girls and commit robbery and kill anyone that you see there. Don’t 
forget to leave’”—and this is very important because in the Hinman 
case they wrote POLITICAL PIGGY in blood. He said “Don’t forget 
to leave a sign.” 


Given that Guenther had used that exact phrase—“leave a sign’”—I was 
almost sure that none of this was a mere “supposition” on Stovitz’s part. But 
he’d never divulged how he knew about Beausoleil’s phone call. Would he 
admit to having heard the tape? 

I doubted it. ’d interviewed Stovitz once already, and he was cagey. He’d 
said he was always convinced that the Tate-—LaBianca murders were copycat 
crimes, but he wouldn’t say why. When I’d asked him why the case wasn’t 
prosecuted that way, he said it was because Bugliosi called the shots. 

And sure enough, when I paid him a second visit, Stovitz was even more 
aloof. He denied ever having heard the Beausoleil tape. He’d heard “rumors” 
of it, he conceded, but never from Guenther. He dismissed me with a 
message: “Tell Charlie Guenther, Mr. Stovitz has a great deal of faith in you 
but unless you have some notes [it didn’t happen].” 

I called Guenther, and I could hear him wilt on the other end of the line. 
“Ts that how he wants it? Then let’s just drop it.” I was deflated, too. Just as 
easily as he’d given me the scoop, Guenther was prepared to take it back. 
“You’re just not going to be able to use it,” he said. “That’s all.” 

As if to prove how thoroughly he’d given up, Guenther began to change 
his story. When I talked to him again two weeks later, he said that he’d 
neither seen nor heard the tape—he only knew of its existence. Exactly 
Stovitz’s position. 


This was going to be a lot more difficult than I thought. 

I drove all the way to Vegas to speak to Guenther’s former partner, Paul 
Whiteley, whose demeanor was the polar opposite. Where Guenther would 
bound about the room, pacing and shaking and pleading, Whiteley barely 
moved. We sat among graceful Chinese porcelain pieces—his wife was a 
collector—and he was as serene and contemplative as the figures depicted in 
the china. 

He remembered the Beausoleil tape clearly. “I heard it, yes,” he told me. 
“Something about leaving a sign.” And he corroborated the story of Captain 
Walsh’s infuriated response. “Walsh was a by-the-book captain. He hit the 
roof!” 

Like Guenther, his investigation had made him overwhelmingly confident 
of one thing: “Helter Skelter didn’t happen.” So many veterans of this case, I 
noticed, were willing to say that the prosecutor had basically fabricated a 
motive, using Manson’s ramblings to button up his case. Helter Skelter was 
“not a motive,” Whiteley said, “but a philosophy.” Bugliosi was well aware 
of this; he just didn’t care. And that meant he didn’t care about the subtleties 
of the Hinman case, either, or about how LASO might go about prosecuting 
it. 

The Beausoleil wiretap was maybe the single biggest break I’d gotten at 
that point, but the stories around it had begun to multiply. Guenther would 
eventually allow me to use him as an on-the-record source, but his account 
muddied the waters more than it cleared them. Despite their bombshell 
evidence of a copycat motive, both he and Whiteley insisted that they simply 
gave up after the LAPD told them to. Although they knew Beausoleil had an 
accomplice, and that he’d called someone at the Spahn Ranch, they never 
even drove out there to question anybody. That didn’t track. Not with these 


guys. 


“The Biggest Circus” 


Around the time I reached an impasse with Guenther, I began to research 
another figure from the county sheriff’s office, one whose scintillating claims 
about LASO and Manson had circulated for decades among counterculture 
enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists. Preston Guillory, once a LASO 


detective, had left the police force under a cloud of suspicion in December 
1969, immediately after the LAPD had announced Manson’s apprehension. 

A couple of years later, in 1971, Guillory gave an interview to Mae 
Brussell, a cult-favorite radio host whose show trafficked in conspiracies— 
some plausible, others outright loony. Reading through the transcript, I found 
myself more intrigued by Guillory than I wanted to be, especially in light of 
what I’d gone through with Guenther and Whiteley. 

Guillory’s thesis was this: Manson had gotten away with far too much at 
the Spahn Ranch in the months before the murders. Even though he was a 
federal parolee, Manson had no job; he had ready access to drugs, alcohol, 
and underage girls; he had a cache of firearms. And LASO officers knew all 
about it. At LASO’s Malibu station—Spahn was in its jurisdiction— 
Manson’s lawlessness was something of an open secret, Guillory said. 
Firemen patrolling the ranch’s fire trails had even encountered Manson and 
the Family toting machine guns. And yet Manson never paid a price. The 
cops always looked the other way. According to Guillory, that was because 
his station had a policy handed down from on high: “Make no arrests, take no 
police action toward Manson or his followers.” 

And so, despite the raft of crimes that Manson and the Family were 
committing, they were never apprehended, and Manson never had his parole 
revoked. There was even an occasion where Manson was picked up by LASO 
police for statutory rape, but they ended up cutting him loose. 

Even as the station instituted this hands-off policy, they kept a close watch 
over Manson. Guillory was sure that LASO’s intelligence unit, or some other 
intelligence unit, was running surveillance on the Spahn Ranch. He alluded to 
memos about Manson—with cover sheets to protect against prying eyes— 
that went straight to the station captain, and who knows where after that. 
Guillory didn’t think the surveillance “was just a local thing.” 

Then came the murder of Gary Hinman, and soon after it the Tate— 
LaBianca murders. How had LASO failed to see this coming? They’d been 
monitoring Manson constantly. Guillory theorized that the massive August 
16 raid on the Spahn Ranch was LASO’s effort to cover its tracks after the 
murders. Calling it “the biggest circus I’ve ever been involved in,” he 
marveled at the fact that all the charges had been dropped seventy-two hours 
later. Something didn’t add up about the raid—all that force, all those arrests, 
for nothing? It was “like we were doing something perhaps a week late to 


show that we had really been watching,” he said on the radio. 

But that raised a bunch of problems. If the sheriff’s office was surveilling 
Manson before the raid, it would’ve known enough to bring him in for the 
murders. If it wasn’t watching him, then how had it amassed enough 
evidence to get the search warrant authorizing the raid? 

When the LAPD held a self-congratulatory press conference to announce 
that Manson and his group were suspects in the Tate—LaBianca murders, 
Guillory decided to become a whistle-blower. He went to a news station, 
KCAL, and told them everything he knew, thinking the press would be all 
over this story. They hardly touched it. Worse, the leak cost him his job: 
LASO’s internal affairs department got wind of his remarks and sent him 
packing. 

After his departure, LASO did all it could to discredit him. An internal 
memo said that no one should discuss his previous employment there. It 
implied that he was a drug addict and an unrepentant leftist bent on smearing 
the office’s reputation. 

Listening to Guillory’s radio interview, I couldn’t say if he was a crackpot 
or not. He was airing a version of events that, a year before, I would’ve 
dismissed as sheer lunacy—and he was doing it on a radio show that traded 
in unadulterated paranoia. But his message resonated with me, especially 
now that I knew how much had been covered up. Guenther had convinced me 
that the tape of Beausoleil’s phone call was real, and I never would’ve 
believed that, either. It seemed possible, if not entirely plausible, that there 
was still more to the story of the sheriff’s office, especially its bungled raid 
on the Spahn Ranch. 

I added Guillory’s name to my whiteboard: one more in the jumble of 
cops and Hollywood has-beens, witnesses reliable and unreliable, with fading 
memories and ulterior motives. Then I picked up the phone. He wasn’t hard 
to find—he ran a private detective agency, paired, somewhat oddly, with a 
traffic school, out of a strip mall off the highway in Riverside. 

When I drove out to visit him, I was relieved to find him calm, confident, 
even fearless. Portly and white-haired, his mustache still flecked with red, he 
had a strong recollection of what he’d told Mae Brussell back in ’71, and he 
stood by all of it. As we spoke, I noticed he had a weapon in a pouch on his 
desk, along with some model police cars; his diploma and graduation photo 
from the sheriff’s academy were hanging on the wall behind him. Despite his 


contentious end with LASO, he remained a proud cop. 

“We were told not to bother these people,” he told me, referring to the 
Family. The order came in a memo from his captain. “Tell him whatever we 
saw or heard, that was one of the first things that I was told when I got to 
Malibu.” Peter Pitchess, the sheriff of Los Angeles County at the time, was 
“memo-minded,” Guillory explained. He exerted immense authority—and 
that authority extended to his officers’ conduct with Manson. “We were 
asked to generate memos every time we had contact with any member of the 
Family,” Guillory said. 

Despite this intense period of information gathering, Manson was never 
charged when he was arrested. Why was a law-breaking parolee allowed to 
go free? “A lot of times we arrest people and the DA would say, We can’t 
keep this person in custody, he’s too valuable, we want him on the streets. 
My suspicion is that Manson was left alone for a while for some reason—I 
don’t know.” It was “very unusual” that someone with a record like 
Manson’s would be left on the streets. 

The shock of the Tate—LaBianca murders, Guillory thought, forced the 
sheriff’s office to hide its own intelligence-gathering efforts. If Manson were 
guilty of homicide, “How could anybody possibly say we let him on the 
streets?” There would’ve been civil liability issues. Careers would have been 
destroyed. And, of course, it would’ve cost Pitchess the next election. 

But that didn’t explain why the police allowed Manson to go free for 
another three months after the Tate murders, knowing he could have killed 
more people. Why not just arrest him right away, and keep their surveillance 
program quiet? 

Guillory had no idea—he’d been asking himself the same question. All he 
knew was “that Manson was under some kind of loose surveillance by our 
department or somebody else. We know he’s being watched by somebody, 
but we don’t know who. The thing is this—if he was under surveillance, 
those people left the ranch on two occasions, committed the seven 
homicides... why was there no intervention?” He added that there was no 
legal obligation for LASO to intervene; they could’ve chosen to let the 
murders pass without action, if Manson were so important that they didn’t 
want to risk interrupting their surveillance. 

Guillory was fairly confident that someone from LASO knew right away 
that the Family had committed those murders. “Probably someone saw them 


come and go and there’s a log entry someplace and then, of course, later they 
found where they went and all hell would’ve broken loose.” 

Plus, he reiterated, LASO never could have launched such an 
extraordinary raid without sound intelligence—enough to persuade a judge to 
grant a search warrant. “You don’t mount a raid without surveillance like 
this!” he said. More infuriating still: none of it stuck. The sheriff’s office 
went to all that effort for nothing. And it didn’t have to be that way, Guillory 
was sure. “We did find evidence of enough criminal activity—stolen 
property, narcotics—to violate [Manson’s] parole in the first place. It was 
astounding! I never could figure out why he was released.” Guillory had been 
part of the operation that day, and he remembered finding stolen purses, 
wallets, and pocketbooks with IDs—all damning evidence, and all seemingly 
ignored. After the raid, he said, the surveillance ended, as mysteriously as it 
had started. 

In another interview, with the writer Paul Krassner, Guillory explained, 
“Tt appeared to me that the raid was more or less staged as an afterthought... 
There was some kind of a grand plan that we were participating in, but I 
never had the feeling the raid was necessary.” He speculated that Manson 
was never arrested “because our department thought he was going to attack 
the Black Panthers.” Their intelligence had revealed that Manson had shot 
Bernard Crowe, whom he mistakenly believed to be a Black Panther, in July, 
and this apparently convinced LASO that Manson “was going to launch an 
attack” on the whole organization. 

Of Guillory’s many outrageous claims, this one was maybe the hardest to 
swallow—but, again, he stuck by it when I asked him. “I believe there was 
something bigger Manson was working on,” he said. “Cause a stir, blame it 
on the Panthers... I’ve got to believe he was involved, based on all info we 
have. Maybe a witting player in someone else’s game.” 

When Manson was finally brought to justice for the murders, LASO took 
dramatic precautions to hide its surveillance of the ranch. “I thought what 
they were doing was illegal,’ Guillory told me. “All the crime reports 
disappeared from the station. Everything was gone, all of our reports were 
gone. Normally you had access to your own reports; they were all gone, 
disappeared. The whole file was gone, and the memo went up that no one 
involved in the Spahn Ranch raid was to talk to anyone outside the 
department.” That convinced Guillory to go to a reporter—the move that cost 


him his job. 

I found Guillory credible, if overheated. I knew I wanted to believe him— 
and that put me at risk of falling into the great trap of conspiracy theorists, 
who come to believe in grand plots simply because they make the world a 
more fascinating place. Certainly I’d have a more interesting magazine story 
on my hands if Guillory were correct. But that was a big if. 

I was in touch with a number of former LASO deputies at this point, and I 
collected their opinions on Guillory. One described him as “kind of an off- 
the-wall guy.” Another said he had “a gigantic chip on his shoulder,” and 
“hard feelings for the sheriff’s department—always feeling that he was being 
beset upon.” 

According to the most pejorative story I heard, Guillory had once tried to 
kill himself in the most dramatic way possible: “He had barricaded himself in 
a motel room in Malibu, I believe, and one of the inspectors was trying to talk 
him out of the room. He was threatening suicide and he had an automatic 
weapon.” I asked the officer if he’d witnessed this firsthand. “I wasn’t 
actually there,” he said, “I just heard about it in the station. John Graham was 
the inspector who talked him out of the room.” 

Guillory called this allegation “bullshit,” reminding me that LASO had 
embarked on a campaign to discredit him after he left. “They tried to put me 
out of business, basically... It was goodbye, we’ll see you, never darken our 
door again. I was crazy, malcontent, a loose cannon.” If he’d really 
barricaded himself in a motel room, he said, “produce a report.” Neither 
LASO files nor the media would have any record of it, because it never 
happened. “Ask Captain Graham: where was the hotel, what was the date? 
Tell him to put up or shut up.” 

In so many words, I did. I called Graham, who, like his colleagues, had a 
negative opinion of Guillory. But had the man really barricaded himself in a 
motel room? “Not that I know of,” Graham said. Once I told him the story, he 
changed his mind. “Now that I recall, I did hear that there was probably a 
phony attempt at suicide.” But he hadn’t been there. 

However reliable Guillory was—and I came to feel he was largely 
reliable, in the end—I was in a familiar predicament. I needed documentary 
evidence to back up his claims. My best shot was leering at me from the 
pages of Helter Skelter: the search warrant for LASO’s massive raid. If 
Bugliosi had found it, couldn’t I? 


On the Paper Trail (Again) 


Charlie Guenther was wary of appearing in my story, but we still talked a lot. 
When I told him I wanted LASO’s files on the Hinman case, he made a 
phone call. Next thing I knew, I had backdoor access to the office’s closed- 
case archives. With some directions and the name of another retired deputy 
sheriff scrawled on a piece of paper, I parked at the sheriff’s training 
academy in East L.A. and knocked on the door of a windowless, barrackslike 
building. 

The deputy let me in and walked me through rows of dusty filing cabinets, 
stopping in front of two and leaving me alone with them. I pulled up a 
folding chair and opened the top drawer. It was crammed with disorganized 
documents that appeared not to have been handled for decades. In the silence 
of the large, dim shed, broken only by the occasional sound of gunshots from 
a nearby firing range, I began my search. 

The crux of the reports, to my delight, covered sheriffs’ activities at the 
Spahn Ranch over the roughly sixteen months the Manson Family had lived 
there. Over the next few months, I made half a dozen visits to the hangar at 
the sheriff’s academy. The retired detective was always happy to see me—I 
suspected I was the only other person he saw all day. When I had questions 
about language or codes in the reports, or even LASO procedure, he’d 
patiently explain them to me as I took notes. And he let me photocopy 
documents, but only after reviewing them first. After a while he barely 
glanced at what I brought him, instead reminding me how he preferred his 
coffee—I’d always return with a cup when I ventured out to a Kinko’s 
nearby. I wasn’t entirely surprised when I learned, several years later, that 
these visits of mine were completely unsanctioned—and unknown to LASO 
top brass. 

In one of my earliest visits, with great relief, I found a copy of the search 
warrant for the August 16 raid. Although other researchers have since 
uncovered it, at that time it had never been seen by anyone outside law 
enforcement. Once I read it, I could understand why: it revealed that LASO 
had a far broader understanding of Manson’s criminal activities—and his 
gurulike control over his followers—than had ever been shared with the 


public. 

Running to sixteen pages, the warrant was rooted in the testimony of 
Deputy Sheriff William C. Gleason, who sought permission for LASO to 
recover “stolen automobile parts... and rifles, automatic pistols, and 
revolvers” from the Spahn Ranch. Charles Manson was the only suspect 
identified by name in the document, which stated that he was the 
unchallenged “leader” of the crime ring and also “on Federal Parole for 
Grand Theft Auto.” 

That last bit is crucial: it means that LASO was officially aware of 
Manson’s parole status. If the police turned up any stolen vehicles or 
weapons—and they did, of course—he would be in violation of the terms of 
his release agreement, and would have to go back to federal prison. 

If Manson was aware of that fact, he didn’t act like it. And the police had 
already shown a willingness to look the other way. The search warrant related 
an incident from an Officer Williams of the LAPD. He told Deputy Gleason 


that within the last two weeks he and his partner were on duty at the 
Spahn Ranch... Mr. Manson was bragging to the officers about the 
weapons available to him and his friends at the Ranch. Mr. Manson 
told the officers that while he was talking to the officers that his 
friends had rifles trained on the officers... this is standard procedure 
whenever officers approach the Ranch. 


Manson had flouted the law and bragged about it to LAPD officers as he had 
his followers train rifles on them—something else, incidentally, not reported 
in Helter Skelter. 

Manson’s cavalier, taunting behavior continued. Elsewhere in the warrant, 
the LAPD’s Ted Leigh said he had found three loaded ammunition clips for a 
carbine that “fell from a dune buggy while on the highway” sometime on or 
around July 29. Leigh soon heard from Manson himself, who said the 
ammunition was his and that he would stop by and pick it up. 

So Manson, a paroled ex-con with a known history of violence, had 
simply called up the cops and asked them if he could come collect the 
ammunition he’d lost? And he’d done this a little more than a week before 
the Tate-LaBianca murders. Manson, the warrant noted, had been 


“mentioned in prior memos,” which fit with Guillory’s insistence that police 
knew how dangerous he was. 

Whether that awareness was the result of surveillance was an open 
question. The warrant explained that LASO deputies had cultivated an 
informant at the ranch, someone who “has seen guns in practically every 
building on the property. The informant was also threatened by Charles 
Manson.” And there was extensive reconnaissance by the same Officer 
Leigh, who “flew over the Spahn Movie Ranch approximately August 1, 
1969, and... observed a 1969 Volkswagen laying [sic] in a ditch.” How often 
did the LAPD use planes to investigate car theft? Why were they flying over 
the ranch, which was out of their jurisdiction? 

Manson was prepared to match their vigilance. Per the warrant, someone 
in the Family had bragged that “we have a guard at each road in [to the ranch] 
with a rifle and a telephone so if anyone comes in, we’ll know they’re 
coming.” Another memo quoted Manson telling a fire inspector, “Don’t try to 
play the ‘man,’ because the next time you try it, you’ll find yourself hanging 
from a tree, upside down, dead.” 

And two days before the murders, an informant told an LAPD sergeant 
that Manson was on his way back from San Francisco with a young runaway 
girl and “a large amount of narcotics.” The memo was partly correct. Manson 
had been in northern California then with a young runaway, but he’d been in 
Big Sur, not San Francisco. Who knows if Manson had that “large amount of 
narcotics,” or if they played a role in the bloodshed to come. In any case, the 
document shook me—it suggested that authorities had tracked Manson with 
plenty of diligence, and with the help of an informant, in the days before the 
murders. They had a reliable sense of his comings and goings from the ranch 
mere hours before he dispatched his killers to the Tate house. And yet, 
somehow, it took them months to pin the murders on him. 

Given the abundance of evidence, it came as no surprise that the raid had 
been authorized. Manson was practically begging for the strong arm of 
justice to come swooping in. When it did, the police got more than they 
bargained for. I found a one-page arrest report for Manson dated August 16, 
the day of the raid. In addition to the stolen cars and weapons, the arresting 
officer wrote that Manson had four stolen credit cards in his possession that 
day: they “fell out of his shirt pocket” when he was taken into custody. This 
had never been reported before. 


In summary: Manson, the known federal parolee, walked away from an 
arrest that caught him with stolen cars and credit cards, an arsenal of 
weapons, and underage runaways. And meanwhile, two of the LASO’s best 
homicide detectives failed to realize that the biggest raid in California history 
was going down at the very same ranch that their murder suspect had called. 


Hundreds of Man-hours and Zero Indictments 


Bugliosi, you may recall, had chalked up the failure to a simple mistake—the 
search warrant was “misdated.” But now that I had it in my hands, I saw no 
evidence of any misdating. The warrant was clearly dated August 13, 1969. 
According to the California penal code, a warrant is good for ten days after 
its date. The raid was completely legal on August 16, a fact I verified with 
many police and attorneys. 

Was there another potential explanation? Ed Sanders went a bit further in 
The Family—in addition to the “misdated” warrant, he wrote that the Family 
was let go because of insufficient evidence. 

To figure it out, I talked to Bill Gleason, the sergeant who’d written the 
search warrant and spent two weeks organizing the raid. We spoke often. I 
always found him quick to smile and patient with my questions, even when I 
implied that he’d been negligent. 

Gleason was still furious at Bugliosi and Sanders for impugning his 
reputation with their talk of “misdating.” They’d led millions of readers to 
assume that a clerical slipup had invalidated the hundreds of man-hours that 
went into the raid. 

The “insufficient evidence” excuse, Gleason told me, was closer to the 
mark. The problem was that none of the evidence—stolen vehicles, guns— 
could be linked to any of the suspects, most especially Manson himself. It 
was all scattered around the ranch. What seemed, in the warrant, like an 
airtight case turned into more of a fishing expedition. 

“It’s pretty hard when you got twenty-seven adults there to prove who 
actually stole a car,” Gleason told me. They’d tried to dust one of the vehicles 
for fingerprints, but it had been sitting out in the dirt for so long that they got 
nothing. 

“The warrant specified Manson’s body to be searched for car keys and 


small parts, because he was said to be the leader,” Gleason said. 

“But do you sleep with your car keys?” I asked, thinking it was ridiculous 
to expect to find them on Manson’s person at the crack of dawn. 

“No,” Gleason said, laughing. “At six a.m. we didn’t know what they 
were going to be doing.” 

What about the stolen credit cards? They were found on Manson’s person, 
having fallen out of his shirt pocket. Couldn’t they have prosecuted Manson 
for those? 

“Yeah, we could,” Gleason said. “But we didn’t know he was going to 
have credit cards when we were doing the search warrant. It was the DA’s 
call, and if he says we’re not going to prosecute him there’s not a whole lot I 
can do.” 

Robert Schirn, the DA who’d signed the warrant for the raid and then 
dismissed the charges a few days later, was still working at the Los Angeles 
District Attorney’s office, so I set up an interview with him. Surrounded by 
plaques and awards, Schirn greeted me with a warm hello and told me to take 
a seat opposite his desk. Like Gleason, he said that it was hard to bring 
charges in a case where the thefts couldn’t be linked to anyone. But what 
about the credit cards? 

“Its been so many years,” Schirn replied. “I don’t know if I was told 
about the credit cards. If they’re in a report, I assume I would have been 
shown the report—and I would have been able to determine that there were in 
fact some stolen credit cards attributable to him.” Maybe Manson was never 
caught attempting to use the cards. He couldn’t recall. 

“So you just don’t remember what went into the decision?” I asked. 

“T really don’t.” 

He looked a little sheepish, and the silence lasted a beat too long. “All I 
did was just fill out the card and went on to my next case.” 


My inner skeptic had trouble taking Gleason and Schirn at face value. But 
let’s say they were right, that the colossal raid of the Spahn Ranch had failed 
to yield any arrests worthy of prosecution, and that it was only a freak 
coincidence that it brought them so close to the group responsible for so 
many murders. Even if you believe that, LASO isn’t free and clear. Because a 
week after their botched raid, the sheriff’s deputies arrested Manson again, 


on totally different charges. And again, he was allowed to go free. 

On August 24, the owner of a property adjacent to the Spahn Ranch 
alerted LASO sheriffs that someone was trespassing. Deputies drove out to 
find Manson and a seventeen-year-old girl, Stephanie Schram, in an 
abandoned cabin, where they’d just had sex. On a bedside table were several 
joints. And the LASO brought in Manson once more, this time on a felony 
pot possession charge and for contributing to the delinquency of a minor. 

As with the raid, published accounts of this incident are thin at best. 
Bugliosi kept it out of Helter Skelter altogether, and Ed Sanders makes only 
passing mention of it in The Family, writing that Manson and Schram were 
released because there was no pot in the cigarettes, only tobacco. 

However, according to an arrest report I found in the LASO files, the 
joints did contain pot—and on August 26 the sheriffs released Manson 
anyway, instead charging Schram with felony possession, even though she 
was a minor with no criminal record. No reason was given for the decision. 

The day after Manson’s release on August 26, a judge signed another 
warrant, this time for Manson’s arrest, on the strength of his having been 
found with drugs and a juvenile. This time, LASO detectives never even 
bothered going to arrest him, something else none of the forty-plus LASO 
officers I interviewed could explain to me, and something again left out of 
Helter Skelter. Manson stayed at the Spahn Ranch until he moved to Death 
Valley around September 10. 

The DA’s order rejecting the pot charges against Manson was signed by 
Monte Fligsten, the deputy district attorney of Van Nuys. Incredibly enough, 
like Schirn, Fligsten was still working in the DA’s office. When I called him, 
though, I found him much warier than Schirn had been. I gave him a quick 
rundown of the files I’d found: Manson, Schram, marijuana, delinquency of a 
minor... ring any bells? 

“T have no recollection,” he said. 

“Do you recall investigating Manson at the time of August of ’69>” 

“T didn’t participate in any of the Manson issues at all,” he said. I offered 
to fax him the documents so he could verify his signature. He said he didn’t 
want to be involved and hung up. 

The LASO deputies who’d arrested Manson were flabbergasted when he 
wasn’t charged at any point after the raid—especially given the effort of the 
raid itself. It was “a bunch of bullshit.” 


The deputies and the DAs had numerous chances to get Manson behind bars, 
or to keep him there, and they failed. 

Even if none of Manson’s charges were prosecutable, they were egregious 
enough to send the parolee back to prison. Bugliosi said as much in Helter 
Skelter: “During the first six months of 1969 alone, [Manson] had been 
charged, among other things, with grand theft auto, narcotics possession, 
rape, contributing to the delinquency of a minor. There was more than ample 
reason for a parole revocation.” 

If LASO officers did try to get Manson’s parole officer to send him back 
to prison, I found no written record of such a request in the files. No one I 
spoke to could even agree on whose job it was to report a federal parole 
violation. The DAs said it was the detectives’ job. The detectives said it was 
the DA’s job. And, at the end of the day, everyone said, Wasn’t it the parole 
officer’s job? “It’s always been a problem,” Bill Gleason told me, “that guys 
would get arrested and released before the P.O. could place a hold.” Then 
again, I had it on good authority that it was precisely Bill Gleason’s duty to 
have told the parole office, and he didn’t. 

I felt like I was trapped in the swirling eddies of some forgotten 
bureaucracy. Maybe Manson was just the beneficiary of a simpler time, when 
police had fewer forces at their disposal and cruder methods of 
communication. 

Samuel Barrett, who was Manson’s parole officer at the time of the 
murders, told me he’d never been informed of the August 1969 arrests. If a 
parolee was involved in a crime at the local level, he said, it was “paramount” 
for the DA to file the charges. Otherwise, it would be hard to send anyone 
back to federal prison. 

“But sheriffs, the DA,” I said, “they all said it was up to you.” 

“They pass the buck,” Barrett said. “It’s all hearsay without filing 
charges.” 


Chasing Kitty Lutesinger 


While Bobby Beausoleil was busy torturing Gary Hinman, he left his 
girlfriend behind at the ranch. Kitty Lutesinger, sixteen, was pregnant with 


his child, and in his absence, she set off a chain of events that gave the 
sheriff’s office another chance to nab Manson. 

Lutesinger had moved out to the Spahn Ranch to be with Beausoleil, but 
she’d never been a perfect fit for the Family. Now that she was pregnant, 
Manson mistrusted her, fearing that she’d compel Beausoleil to leave the 
group and raise their child. Lutesinger, in turn, was uneasy around Manson. 
He was always speechifying about the end of the world, fooling around with 
guns, and heaping abuse on anyone who crossed him. So, with her boyfriend 
showing no signs of returning anytime soon, Lutesinger ran away from the 
ranch. 

LASO sheriffs found her on July 30 and took her in for questioning, since 
she was a teen runaway. She told them everything she knew about Manson: 
that he was an ex-con who’d threatened her life and her relatives’ if she left 
the Family, that there were drugs and guns stockpiled at the ranch, and that 
many of the Family were runaway girls. Police sent her home to her parents 
in the San Fernando Valley. But she’d proven so informative that Bill 
Gleason drove out there to interview her again eleven days later, in 
preparation for the big raid. This would’ve been on August 10—just a day 
after the bodies had been found at Cielo Drive. 

I couldn’t find his full report in the LASO files, but Ed Sanders wrote 
about it in The Family, and he included an eye-opening detail: Lutesinger 
asked Gleason if the Black Panthers were behind the Tate murders. “I had 
been programmed to believe it was the Panthers who did it,” she told him. 

That remark should have raised a red flag. The timeline is the key. This 
conversation took place when the bodies at Cielo Drive were barely cold. As 
Gleason knew, Lutesinger had been away from the Manson Family since 
August 1, when she fled the ranch. So if she had, in fact, been “programmed 
to believe” that the Panthers killed Tate, the programming must’ve occurred 
before the murders, by someone who was responsible for them. Gleason 
should’ve suspected that Manson, or at least someone at the Spahn Ranch, 
knew more. (He told me he had no memory of discussing the Tate murders 
with Lutesinger, and found it unlikely that he had. The murders “had only 
occurred a few hours before. There probably wouldn’t have been anything 
much on the news at that time.” In fact, the bodies had been discovered more 
than twenty-four hours before he interviewed her; they’d dominated the 
news.) 


Even though Lutesinger had cooperated with police, she apparently 
couldn’t decide where her allegiances were. On August 15, she ran away 
again, fleeing her parents’ home and returning to the Spahn Ranch. 

That same day, Guenther and Whiteley, still searching for accomplices in 
the Hinman murder—though, for some reason, they never checked the Spahn 
Ranch—learned that Lutesinger was Beausoleil’s girlfriend and immediately 
deemed her a person of interest, issuing an all-points bulletin for her arrest. 
On August 17, the day after their colleagues raided the Spahn Ranch, 
Guenther and Whiteley visited her parents. I found Whiteley’s interview 
notes in the LASO files. Lutesinger’s parents confirmed that she was 
pregnant by their main suspect, that she’d been living at the Spahn Ranch 
until August 1, and that she’d run away again the night before, though they 
didn’t know where. Whiteley did note that Manson had personally phoned 
the Lutesinger home the preceding week, and that Kitty had spoken to him. 

In fact, at the very moment of that interview, Kitty Lutesinger was in 
LASO custody. She’d been picked up with the rest of the Family in the raid. 

And here, to my mind, the credibility of the LASO deputies stretches to its 
breaking point. Guenther and Whiteley had just posted the bulletin for 
Lutesinger’s arrest. They’d just learned that she’d been living at the Spahn 
Ranch—along with their primary murder suspect. And yet they didn’t go to 
the ranch to look for her. They did nothing. 

All they had to do was stop by, and they would have learned that everyone 
from the ranch was in jail at the Malibu station; they could’ve gone there, 
interviewed Lutesinger, and potentially cracked the Hinman and the Tate— 
LaBianca murders four months earlier than those crimes were. 

Why didn’t they go? For two reasons, Guenther told me. First, he and 
Whiteley never heard about the August 16 raid, even though their colleagues 
conducted it, and it was the largest in state history. Bill Gleason backed them 
up on this. “We were two independent units,” he told me. “We really had no 
reason to contact each other or even knew about the investigations going on.” 

Gleason said he “purposely kept everything quiet” about the raid. But 
he’d also said that a few stray LAPD squad cars had found out about it 
somehow and came along uninvited. Plus, as Bugliosi reported in Helter 
Skelter, the raid was on the front page of the local section of the next day’s 
Los Angeles Times, beside a story about the still unsolved Tate murders. 

Guenther’s second reason was that Kitty Lutesinger’s parents told him 


they’d already been to the ranch to look for her, and they’d been told that she 
wasn’t there. But did he really expect a runaway’s friends to turn her over to 
her parents, especially when everyone knew the cops were sniffing around 
for a murder suspect? He didn’t even attempt an answer; we just sat in silence 
for a while. 

Gleason had organized the raid. It would seem that it was only a matter of 
time until he realized that Lutesinger, whom he’d interviewed just six days 
earlier, was sitting in one of his jail cells while homicide detectives sought 
her out. He’d given me copies of his files on the case—one of them, a 
timeline of the investigation, had an entry dated August 17, 1969: “Whitely 
[sic] & Guenther tell Gleason that Lutesinger is wanted for questioning in 
Hinman murder.” 

But Gleason told me that he didn’t even know Lutesinger was arrested 
during his own raid. She’d been booked under a fake name, because everyone 
in the Family used aliases. I reminded him that he’d already known that. It 
was in the search warrant affidavit he wrote before the raid, and Lutesinger 
herself had told him. Plus, one of the arrest reports in the LASO files said that 
he’d taken it on himself to learn the true identities of each suspect. He was 
unmoved. “She was just another face,” he said. “I had a lot of things going on 
that day. I doubt if I would have recognized her.” Lutesinger was released 
with the rest of the Family on August 18, and remained with them at the 
Spahn Ranch until mid-September, when they all moved to Death Valley. No 
one ever went to the ranch to look for her, despite the all-points bulletin out 
for her arrest. 


The last time I saw Guenther was in January 2005, when I visited him to go 
through a timeline I’d made of his investigation of the Hinman murder. I told 
him that I couldn’t believe he never went to the Spahn Ranch to solve the 
case. The police had Bobby Beausoleil in custody, and they knew he’d called 
the ranch asking for help. They knew his girlfriend lived there. They knew 
he’d stolen two of Hinman’s cars. If nothing else, surely they would’ve 
gotten a warrant to search his last known residence—the ranch—for evidence 
of the theft. 

But Guenther stuck to his story. He looked at the floor and said, “Maybe 
we just made a mistake.” 


I wasn’t a seasoned crime reporter. Most of what I knew about the 
criminal justice system I’d gleaned from the news, police procedurals, and 
legal thrillers. So I went to Kimberly Kupferer, the chairman of the criminal 
law section for the California State Bar, and asked her to walk me through the 
standard operating procedure in murder investigations. 

Kupferer contradicted Guenther on every point. She said it was standard 
practice to go to a murder suspect’s last residence—whether “it’s a ranch, 
motel room, or rat hole”’—to search for evidence, especially in a robbery- 
homicide, like the Hinman case was. The fact that the detectives didn’t go 
was “highly unusual,” in her estimation. 

Though I knew I was really pushing my luck, I made another call to 
Guenther in February 2005. “I know you’ve always told me, ‘You’ll never 
hear an untrue word from Guenther or Whiteley,’” I said, “but is there 
anything you haven’t told me that would make me better understand your 
actions in this case?” 

“No,” he said faintly. 

“Okay,” I said. “One last question: Were you ever told by anyone to back 
off the Manson Family or the Spahn Ranch in your investigation of the 
Hinman murder?” 

“No,” he said again, this time almost inaudibly. “I was not.” 

I couldn’t ask Whiteley the same questions. After my first meeting with 
him, he refused to speak with me again. 


“Chicken Shit” 


Sometimes, seemingly ancillary people would completely refocus my 
reporting. Such was the case with Lewis Watnick, the former head deputy 
DA of Van Nuys. I wanted to talk to Watnick precisely because he had 
nothing to do with the Manson case: he worked in the same office as the DAs 
who had, so he could offer some valuable perspective without feeling boxed 
in. 

I went to visit him at his house in Thousand Oaks. I can still picture him 
shuffling to the door: a frail, thin man in his sixties, with wispy brown hair, a 
nice smile, and sad eyes. Suffering from an illness, he spoke in a labored, 
rasping whisper. His home was air-conditioned to frigidity. 


He spent a while reading my documents in silence, and then he sighed. 
“Chicken shit!” he croaked. “This is all a bunch of chicken shit.” The size of 
the raid; the fact that the DA’s office kept releasing Manson when they had 
enough evidence to charge him, or at least violate his parole... “It dovetails 
right in,” he said. “Manson was an informant.” 

It was only a guess, he conceded, but an educated one, based on his thirty 
years in the job. It wasn’t the first time I’d heard the theory. One of my 
LASO sources had wondered if Manson “had his finger in a bigger pie.” 
Having been in the office’s intelligence division, he’d seen stuff like this 
before. “What happens in those situations is either he’s giving up somebody 
bigger than himself or he’s on somebody else’s list as far as a snitch, or he’s 
ratting out other people.” And if he were informing for someone else, the 
DEA or the feds, no one in the LASO would know about it, necessarily. 
Robert Schirn, the DA who authorized the raid only to dismiss the charges, 
had made the same suggestion: “Another possibility, sheer speculation, is that 
[Manson] may have been an informant for somebody.” But LASO deputies 
had all denied it. 

“Of course,” Watnick said when I told him that. “Confidential informant 
means they’re confidential.” 

Neither of us could say what or who it was that Manson would have any 
decent information about. Drug dealers? Watnick wondered if it had a 
political dimension, given Manson’s antagonistic relationship to the Black 
Panthers. “Maybe,” he continued, muttering more to himself than to me, it 
was someone “big... possibly the FBI.” 

True, the search warrant was littered with references to Manson’s fear of 
the Black Panthers. He thought the group was about to attack the ranch. One 
memo I’d found even said that Manson claimed to have seen “carloads” of 
“negroes” on the property photographing the Family. A fire patrolman 
reported that Family members had told him they’d moved into the canyons 
because they’d “killed a member of the Black Panthers.” 

“You know there’s an old saying: an enemy of my enemy is my friend,” 
Watnick said. “So, if Manson figured out this black-white confrontation, he 
may have been giving out information to the FBI,” who had a vendetta 
against the Panthers. 

Hearing this from Watnick—someone from the DA’s office, but 
unaffiliated with the case—boosted my confidence. Looking at the lengthy 


search warrant again, he kept grumbling. “Helicopters, agents carrying 
automatic weapons, three different departments, four weeks of official 
surveillance... They had this massive raid and everybody’s released two days 
later!” He shook his head. “The more that he’s released, the more I feel that 
he was released because they’d get more out of him by having him released,” 
he said. “They’d been watching this guy for something large... The thing that 
I wonder about is who was watching.” 

Watnick urged me to go back to Gleason—he knew the detective well, he 
said, and he trusted him. Why did Gleason just roll over when the DA’s 
office undid all his hard work? As for this notion that Manson’s parole officer 
couldn’t find him in violation with charges from the DA, “That’s bullshit, 
too,” Watnick said. 

As promised, I went back to Gleason, who calmly but adamantly denied 
that Manson was an informant. He didn’t even see a glimmer of a possibility. 
“I’m sure that I would have heard something like that,” he told me. “I never 
heard anything. Even if he was an LAPD informant, I’m sure I would have 
been contacted by LAPD... I never heard a word.” He added, “The guy was a 
jerk... Every cop I talked to wanted to get him buried.” 

Then why had all of them failed? I couldn’t stop turning it over in my 
mind: the image of Watnick, hunched over my files in his chilly home, 
grumbling with such certainty, “Manson was an informant.” 


Coda: “A Huge No-no” 


I did most of my reporting on LASO in 2000. As with all aspects of my 
investigation, I kept thinking that I’d return to the key subjects someday and 
try them again, seeing if the passage of time had loosened them up somehow. 
I imagined a cascade effect—once I got somebody—say, Vince Bugliosi or 
Terry Melcher—to admit to a major cover-up, other areas of the case would 
begin to open up, too, or I could brandish an incriminating document that 
would change people’s minds. 

But you can guess what happened. I kept reporting and reporting, and 
time had other plans. In my obsession, I began to think of the story as a 
puzzle I could solve, if only I recovered all the pieces. I listened again and 
again to my interview tapes; I wrote out intricate timelines listing my 


subjects’ every move, day by day and sometimes hour by hour, trying to 
discern who knew what, and when they knew it. I kept lists of possible 
explanations, about gun laws and parole laws and car-theft laws, and, most 
critically, about how those laws were written and enforced in 1969. 

By 2005, Pd moved away from the LASO angle of the story, but I found 
myself constantly thinking about it. I knew I had to take another look at the 
archive to fill in some blanks. I was under the impression that I could go back 
anytime. I’d interviewed more than forty deputies over the years, making no 
effort to hide my reporting. One of them had told me that the sheriff himself, 
Leroy Baca, wanted to learn about what I was doing and “offer the sheriff 
department’s cooperation.” 

But no one—except, evidently, the pair of retired deputies who got me 
into the archive in the first place—had any idea that I’d accessed the LASO 
files on the case. When I called the main office and asked to go back in, they 
were, to put it mildly, enraged. From the first officer I spoke to, all the way 
up to Sheriff Baca, the response to my request was a resounding no. 

I argued that they’d set a precedent by letting me in before, unauthorized 
or not. For accuracy’s sake, they owed it to me—and to the public, assuming 
I ever reached the end of my reporting—to let me in to recheck my notes. But 
because I’d never signed in anywhere, there was no record of my visits, they 
said, so it was like I’d never been there at all—even though I could show 
them the many files I’d photocopied. 

When I persisted, they allowed me to make my case in person with the 
sheriff’s captain of homicide. I arrived to find not one but three deputies, 
who’d invented a new reason to keep me out. I couldn’t go back in, they said, 
because there was an “open case” against unnamed Family members 
involving “stolen credit cards.” 

That couldn’t be, I said. The statute of limitations on any type of theft by 
the Family would have long run out. They didn’t care. Sergeant Paul 
Delhauer, who had more or less seized control of the meeting, told me there 
was “stuff you can never be told, will never know about” regarding the case. 
Then he showed me the door. 

When Id been in the LASO archive all those years ago, it had been 
Delhauer’s job to decide who got access and who didn’t. For that reason, the 
sheriff’s office had decided he was the guy who had to take my calls now. So 
I did call him—again and again, and again after that. We got on each other’s 


nerves, and our conversations devolved into intense acrimony. “What 
happened as far as you getting access to those materials,” he said with the air 
of a martinet, “was a huge no-no.” 

Delhauer accepted that this no-no wasn’t my fault, and in his more 
charitable moments he allowed that it put me in a tricky position. But he 
didn’t see what he could do to help. 

“I don’t really care, Tom,” he said. “I see absolutely no significance to 
those questions. They have nothing to do with the resolution of the case. 
They have nothing to do with the scope of the investigation.” 

I told him about Watnick’s theory—that Manson might’ve been an 
informant. “This is rank speculation,” he said. “I honestly find this 
appalling.” Well, of course it was speculation. That was one reason I’d tried 
to get back into the files—to see if there was any validity to it. 

“I don’t get paid to do your research,” Delhauer said. “Everybody seems 
to be jumping to conclusions about some big grandiose thing,” he said. 

Worn down by my persistence, Delhauer finally agreed to remind Sheriff 
Baca of his long-ago offer of “the sheriff department’s cooperation.” If I 
wrote a letter to Baca, Delhauer would make sure he received it. 

When Baca didn’t respond to my letter, I was unrelenting, following up 
constantly. At last, I was granted an interview with the sheriff himself, who, 
it became apparent, had been thoroughly briefed on the angle I was pursuing. 

Elected to his post in 1998, Baca had become a major figure in California 
law enforcement. Heading the nation’s largest sheriff’s office, he oversaw 
eighteen thousand employees with a jurisdiction covering more than four 
thousand square miles. Known as a strict enforcer with a no-nonsense style, 
he was at the peak of his power in November 2005, when we met at his 
headquarters. 

I followed the tall, lean lawman as he marched down a hall to his office: 
large and comfortably furnished, with ceramic sculptures from Asia and three 
dramatically lit, floor-to-ceiling trophy cases. Hanging on a wall was a 
framed quote of Baca’s from the Los Angeles Times: “We need to carefully 
concern ourselves with the feelings of other individuals and not engage in 
rhetoric that just inflames divisiveness.” 

We sat at a coffee table; I was on a couch, he in an easy chair, tan and 
slightly stooped, wearing his uniform. Making it clear the meeting was going 
to be brief, he suggested I get right to my point. I wanted to get back into the 


files, I said, to learn why his department had been so lenient on Manson. 

Baca fixed me with an unblinking, unnerving stare, and said, “The reality 
is that Charlie Manson as an individual was a dopehead, a weirdo, a cultist, 
and a control freak... Charlie’s not a guy who is going to get pimped by a 
cop.” 

“He seemed pretty fearless of them,” I said. “When they went to the 
ranch, he told them he had men in the hills with guns on them.” 

“Tt further exemplifies that he doesn’t need anyone to help him... You 
know, look at the obvious here, he’s not reliable even in terms of his own 
conditions. Now, if he’s not reliable in defining himself, how is he going to 
be reliable in defining something useful for the cops?” 

Most of what he said followed this line of thinking: Manson was too 
unstable to be of use to law enforcement. As for Guenther and Whiteley’s 
backing away from the case, he didn’t want to touch it. 

“Every sheriff I interviewed,” I told him, “said they couldn’t get around 
the fact that Guenther and Whiteley didn’t go to the ranch.” 

“T think that only they can account for why they didn’t go,” he said. “It’s 
interesting, in the pursuit of criminals, even when you’re on the hot trail, and 
something distracts the effort that you’re into, you’ll say Pl do that 
tomorrow, and then tomorrow is going to interfere with some other damn 
thing... and then before you know it a whole week has gone by.” 

I reminded him that this wasn’t any old murder case. Guenther and 
Whiteley believed, truly believed, that their case was tied into the biggest 
unsolved murders in Los Angeles history, a crime that had the city living in 
fear. 

“T can assure you that they aren’t part of a larger deal-making person with 
a guy like Charles Manson. You can’t hide something like that.” 

“Tf I present it this way,” I said, implying that he was leaving me no other 
option, “they’re going to look like bad cops.” 

“Incompetent. Not bad.” 

Our meeting ended almost as quickly as it started. Baca, who’d kept me 
waiting more than an hour, had to get to a dinner in Pasadena. We walked out 
together, trailed by his driver. Out in the dusk, he turned to me before we 
parted ways. “If you’d like a little more assistance, I will get you in touch 
with someone who does run informants and let you throw that hypothetical at 
them,” he said. Thinking of Manson, he added, “He’s a weirdo. What kind of 


cop is going to rely on a weirdo for anything?” 

I didn’t say anything. I knew it was useless. The sheriff had his mind 
made up before he met me. As his driver pulled up in his sedan, Baca gave 
me a final once-over, as if still not certain what to make of me. Then he 
shook his head and, getting into his car, said, “You got Hollywood fluff, like 
Marilyn Monroe was murdered, that’s what you got. But that’s good. That’s 
what sells books.” 


Baca retired in 2014. In 2017, a jury found him guilty of obstructing an FBI 
investigation into inmate abuse in Los Angeles County jails. He was 
sentenced to three years in federal prison. Before a packed courtroom, a U.S. 
district judge told him: “Your actions embarrass the thousands of men and 
women who put their lives on the line every day. They were a gross abuse of 
the trust the public placed in you... Blind obedience to a corrupt culture has 
serious consequences.” 

I found Baca contemptuous and condescending that day in 2005. He did, 
however, make good on his offer to me, putting me in touch with the head of 
his detective division, Commander Robert Osborne, who was the closest 
thing LASO had to an expert on informants. I gave him my song and dance— 
well rehearsed, by then—and, while he found it unlikely that Manson had 
ever informed for his office, he said it was possible for a federal agency to 
call and ask for one of its informants to be released from LASO custody. In 
such cases, they’d call the investigator; the captain would be uninvolved. 

“It’s possible that a phone call was made, yes. [But] what benefit would 
be gained by keeping it a secret forever? The theory that somebody asked 
them to do something different than the norm is not implausible,” he 
admitted, “though I don’t know why they wouldn’t tell you. I can’t imagine 
why they would want to keep it a secret. I don’t see anything to be gained— 
if, in fact, there was some other agency involved in 1969 or 2005—to keep 
that quiet.” 

Unless, I thought, it resulted in the murders of innocent people. 

I sensed this was the closest thing to a concession I’d ever get from the 
L.A. County Sheriff’s Office. I thanked Osborne for his time and went on my 
way. 


This is what desperation does to a writer. I knew that Guenther would be 
enraged if he learned that Baca had called him and Whiteley “incompetent.” I 
wondered if this might be what would finally get him to break the code of 
silence—the fact that he, one of the most legendary detectives in LASO 
history, had been denigrated by the head of his former office. I didn’t have 
the heart to tell him, but I did tell one of his friends, who was understandably 
outraged. I had a hunch he’d share it with others, including Guenther. But it 
still took me six years to call him. 

When I did, he sounded tired and defeated, not like the Charlie Guenther I 
remembered. He still had a funny way of calling me by my full name in 
conversation. 

“I want to close the door on that, Tom O’ Neill,” Guenther said. “I want to 
end it with you. Lee Baca kind of upset me. Our conversation is over.” 

I apologized and explained why I didn’t think he was incompetent, and 
why I was sure that anyone who knew his record didn’t, either. But it didn’t 
break the wall. “Twenty years I did this,” he said quietly, referring to his time 
in homicide, “and Baca said I’m incompetent... I just want it to finish. Hell, 
I’m eighty-three years old.” 

“IĮ just want to write the truth about why those murders happened,” I said. 

“I know what you’re saying, Tom, and I’d ask you to accommodate me. 
This is over forty years ago and I’d like to be out of it... please, Tom O’ Neill. 
I have no squabbles with you... I’m totally done.” 

Guenther died in 2014. I was heartbroken by the frailty I heard in his 
voice that day. And I was confused. In the throes of my obsession with the 
case, I couldn’t understand how such a celebrated detective would want to 
shut the door on it, to lose his drive to get to the bottom of it. But that was 
when I assumed I’d soon shut the door myself. Now many more years have 
passed, and that door is still open, and I understand Guenther perfectly.

Who Was Reeve Whitson? 


Fairy early in my reporting, I knew I could have wrapped up my Premiere 


story if I really wanted to. I had the guts of a great piece, even if it was too 
late for the milestone thirtieth anniversary of the murders. Pd spoken to 
duplicitous celebrities, seedy drug dealers, bumbling cops, and spurious 
prosecutors. I’d been threatened and cajoled and warned off my investigation. 
But I didn’t have a smoking gun. There were only mountains of 
circumstantial evidence. The thrust of my story was still mired in ambiguity. 
I worried that my reporting could be too easily dismissed, Lee Baca-—style, as 
“Hollywood fluff.” 

So I kept going, although in many ways I’ve come to regret it. A few of 
my interviews were especially tormenting—the ones that convinced me I 
couldn’t call it quits yet. I thought of Little Joe, Jay Sebring’s barber, who’d 
received an elliptical phone call from a mobster after the murders. And of the 
first suspects, Charles Tacot and Billy Doyle, who claimed to have 
intelligence connections. And of Preston Guillory, who alleged that police 
allowed Manson to remain free because they knew he planned to attack the 
Black Panthers. I thought most of all about the possibility that Manson, of all 
people, had some type of protection from law enforcement or was even an 
informant. It boggled the mind even to speculate that someone like Manson 
could be plugged into something bigger, and presumably even darker, than he 
was. But this is where the reporting took me. 

I started reading up on the use of informants. Perusing old editions of the 
two major Los Angeles papers of the era, the Times and the Herald 


Examiner, I learned that in the midsixties both the LAPD and LASO had 
infiltrated groups they considered a threat to the status quo: antiwar leftists, 
the Black Panther party, and other black militant groups like the US 
Organization, a fierce rival of the Panthers in Los Angeles. Posing as leftists, 
agents provocateurs would gain the trust of these groups from the inside, 
provoking them to commit crimes or do violence against rivals. 

Even from a distance, this line of inquiry gave me pause. I’d never been 
interested in conspiracies. I wasn’t one to speculate about a second shooter in 
JFK’s assassination or faking the moon landing. For the first time, though, I 
saw the appeal of trafficking in murky secrets—it was an attractive option, as 
long as people believed you. If I found the plot, I could change the way 
people understood one of the seminal crimes, and criminals, of the twentieth 
century. If I got it wrong, or took too much on faith, Pd become someone 
who made people glaze over at parties, politely excusing themselves as I 
droned on about “the big picture.” 

Even if it made me look crazy, I wanted to see whether the informant 
theory held water: if Manson had any credible connections to the government 
or law enforcement, and if I could link him to the police infiltrations of leftist 
groups I’d read about. Then, as if Pd conjured him from thin air, someone 
emerged who fit into the puzzle. He seemed to have wandered into Southern 
California from the pages of a spy novel, and not a very well written one, at 
that. His name was Reeve Whitson, and his intersections with the Manson 
investigation suggested a dimension to the Tate—LaBianca murders that had 
been wiped from the official record. 


“I Had to Save My Ass” 


It started with Shahrokh Hatami, Sharon Tate’s friend and personal 
photographer. When I spoke with Hatami over the phone in 1999, he’d never 
given an interview about the murders. Sorting through his memories, he 
recalled something he’d never been able to explain. 

At seven in the morning on August 9, 1969, Hatami got a frantic phone 
call from a friend. Rubbing sleep from his eyes, he listened as the caller 
delivered the terrible news: Sharon Tate and four others had been murdered 
in her home on Cielo Drive. Afterward, in numb terror, he and his girlfriend 


switched on the radio and listened all morning for further reports. They had 
to wait a while. As Hatami later learned, that call came ninety minutes before 
the Polanskis’ maid had arrived at the house, discovered the bodies, and ran 
screaming to the neighbors, who called the police. Unwittingly, Hatami had 
become one of the first people in the world to hear about the murders—all 
because of his friend. 

That “friend” was Reeve Whitson, whom Hatami characterized as “a 
mystery man”—a phrase I’d hear a lot as I researched him in earnest. A close 
friend of Tate and Polanski, Whitson had a talent for discretion. When people 
remembered him at all, he was usually on the periphery, coming and going, 
his purpose unknown, his motives inscrutable. 

If Whitson’s involvement had been limited to that early phone call, I don’t 
know whether I’d have given him a second thought. It seemed entirely 
possible that Hatami had gotten the time wrong. To get some sense of 
Whitson’s role in the case, I looked his name up in the trial transcript. It 
appeared four times, all during Hatami’s testimony. It was Whitson, he 
confirmed on the stand, who brought him to Bugliosi during the 
investigation. And yet Whitson never appeared in Helter Skelter, which gave 
an otherwise detailed account of Hatami’s story. 

As well it should. Hatami’s testimony was a dramatic high point. Before 
the packed courtroom, he explained that five months before the murders, he’d 
been visiting Sharon Tate when he noticed someone on the property. Hustling 
toward the front door, he found short, scraggly Manson standing there. 
Manson asked if Terry Melcher was around. Hatami, wanting to be rid of 
him, sent Manson around back. He knew that Rudi Altobelli lived in the 
guesthouse and could tell him where to find Melcher. 

Hatami’s story proved that Manson knew where the house on Cielo Drive 
was, and how to get there. And it added some tragic foreshadowing: since 
Tate, Sebring, Folger, and Frykowski were in the room behind Hatami, this 
would be the one and only time Manson laid eyes on his future victims. 

The problem, Hatami revealed to me, was that he’d never been confident 
that it was Manson he saw that day. His uncertainty meant nothing to 
Bugliosi and Reeve Whitson, who coerced his testimony anyway. “The 
circumstances I was put through to become a witness,” Hatami said, “I didn’t 
like at all.” Whitson told him, “‘Hatami, you saw that guy, Altobelli said so, 
we need another person to corroborate it.’” (Presumably, Bugliosi felt he 


needed two accounts of Manson’s visit to the house that day; it was such an 
important part of tying Manson to the murder scene.) 

Hatami demurred, and Whitson turned the screws, effectively threatening 
him with deportation—he said he’d ensure that Hatami, an Iranian without 
U.S. citizenship, wouldn’t be able to get another visa. If he wanted to stay in 
America, all he had to do was say he’d seen Manson that day at Tate’s house. 
Not long after, Whitson brought Hatami to his car and showed him his gun. 
Although Hatami didn’t know Whitson too well, he took the threat seriously 
—he believed that Whitson really had the means to deport him. 

“I was framed by Mr. Whitson,” Hatami told me. “I was never sure it 
happened that way. I had to save my ass.” Bugliosi and I were still speaking 
then, so I asked him if he knew Whitson at all. He didn’t recall the name, he 
claimed. Hatami thought that was “rubbish.” “Bugliosi knows him very 
well,” he said. “I could not have been a witness without Reeve.” 

He was right. Because the defense suspected that Bugliosi and Whitson 
had, indeed, coerced Hatami’s story, they called on Bugliosi to explain 
himself at the trial. Under oath, but out of the presence of the jury, Bugliosi 
tried to answer for the fact that he’d interviewed Hatami without a tape 
recorder or a stenographer. Who was in the room when Hatami talked? “Just 
Reeve Whitson, myself, and Mr. Hatami,” Bugliosi replied. The judge 
decided that Hatami couldn’t testify to having seen Manson. The jury heard 
only that he was at the house when a man came to the door, and that he sent 
the man to the guesthouse. 

But of course Bugliosi had forgotten that he’d supplied Whitson’s name 
under oath. Whitson wanted it that way. He served his purpose and then 
disappeared, Hatami said, like “a piece in a chess game.” 


A Photographic Memory 


If Whitson was a chess piece, who was moving him around? He’d died in 
1994, so I couldn’t ask him. Hatami gave me the names of people who 
might’ve known him. Almost invariably they told me the same thing: that 
Whitson had been an undercover agent of some kind. Some said he was in the 
FBI, others the Secret Service. The rough consensus, though, was that he was 
part of the CIA, or an offshoot special-operations group connected to it. 


It seemed absurd, the first time I heard it: an undercover agent wrangling 
witnesses for the Manson trial. It seemed absurd the second and third times, 
too. But then I kept hearing it, dozens of times—Reeve Whitson belonged to 
an intelligence agency. As I talked to his confidants, a portrait emerged. 
Whitson had been serious, secretive, compartmentalized. He lived “about 
eight lives simultaneously,” as one friend put it. He had eccentric habits and 
an eidetic memory. What he did with that memory, and whom he did it for, 
remained the subject of feverish speculation. 

Bill Sharman, a former NBA player and general manager of the Lakers, 
had known Whitson since 1980. He recalled his friend’s “photographic 
mind.” Sharman met me with his wife, Joyce. Both believed Whitson was 
connected to the Manson case. “He said he worked for the CIA... He told us 
he was involved in the investigation, but gave us no details,” Joyce said. 
“Reeve would tell us the most preposterous things and eventually we’d find 
out that they were true... we learned to start believing him. We loved him 
very much, but he was always a mystery to us.” 

That word cropped up whenever I asked anyone about Reeve. Even those 
who’d known him well described him as a complete enigma, with a penchant 
for telling unbelievable stories that turned out to be true. Another friend, 
Frank Rosenfelt, the former president and chief executive of MGM, who’d 
known Whitson since ’75, called him “the strangest guy in the world.” 

“He didn’t lie,” Rosenfelt told me. “He did not put himself in a position 
where he told you something and you could disprove it.” He was confident 
that Whitson “had some intel connection, no doubt about it.” Rosenfelt was 
one of a few people who remarked on Whitson’s odd tendency to call from 
pay phones. He “would call me for hours... I always wondered, who the hell 
is paying the bills? And always from a phone booth on the street!” And 
“Reeve knew a lot about the Manson situation,” Rosenfelt said. “He indicated 
that if they had listened to him that a lot of people may have not been killed. 
He was heavily involved.” 

“If who had listened to him?” I asked. 

“I think he meant whoever was looking into it. The federal people, law 
enforcement people. He implied he gave a lot of suggestions, he was 
involved and they didn’t listen to him... He was bitter about it.” 

That implied Whitson had some advance knowledge of the Family’s 
plans. I wrote it off as a faulty memory until I heard it again. Richard and 


Rita Edlund, who met Whitson through Rosenfelt, described a “very cryptic” 
figure who took pains to avoid detection. “I knew he helped in the Manson 
investigation,” Richard, a special-effects cinematographer, said. “Reeve was 
among those, if not the one, who broke the Tate case.” But, like the others I’d 
spoken to, Richard couldn’t offer too many specifics, only beguiling 
memories: “He operated in the CIA—I believe he was on their payroll... 
Reeve was the kind of guy who, because of his background, he still would 
turn the inside light of his car out, so when he opened his door the light 
wouldn’t go on. Because he had it that you never know who’s looking.” He 
“used his thumbnail to tear the top-right-hand corner of every piece of paper 
he handled, to mark it. Can’t shake old ways, he used to say.” 

With his “gift of gab,” Whitson had “anything but a military bearing.” A 
man who couldn’t be stereotyped, he “was infiltrating the town in his 
incredibly charming way. He was friends with Jay Sebring and Polanski was 
a buddy of his, and the Beach Boys—and he met Manson through all this.” 

“Before the murders?” I asked. 

“Oh, yeah!” Their encounter had come through Dennis Wilson, Edlund 
recalled, in the period when Manson was trying to break into the music 
business through the Beach Boys. “Reeve was the kind of guy who would 
meet everybody. He would create the infrastructure of the town in his mind— 
there was hardly anybody that he didn’t know.” 

The likeliest story, Pd thought, was that Whitson was some kind of con 
man, or at least a slick liar—and that Shahrokh Hatami had simply 
misremembered or exaggerated the incidents culminating in his testimony. 
But Whitson’s friends had me more and more convinced that he’d been 
involved with Manson. Maybe the most compelling evidence came from Neil 
Cummings, a lawyer who’d known Whitson since ’84. Several people had 
told me he was among Reeve’s closest confidants, so I took him to lunch. I 
hadn’t told him about Hatami’s claim—that Whitson had called him before 
the bodies were even identified—but he corroborated it independently. 

According to Cummings, Whitson was in a top-secret arm of the CIA, 
even more secretive than most of the agency. He talked a lot about his 
training in killing people, implying that he’d done it at least a few times. And 
when it came to Manson, he “was closer to it than anybody,” Cummings 
avowed: 


He was actively involved with some sort of investigation when it 
happened. He worked closely with a law enforcement person and 
talked quite a bit about events leading up to the murders, but I don’t 
remember what they were. He had regrets for not stopping them, for 
doing something about it. 

He had a reason to believe something weird was about to happen at 
the [Tate] house. He might have been there when it happened, right 
before or after—the regret was maybe that he wasn’t there when it 
happened. He told me he was there after the murders, but before the 
police got there. He said there were screw-ups before and after. I 
believe he said he knew who did it, and it took him a long time to lead 
police to who did it. 


Whitson had the Tate house under surveillance, Cummings added, which is 
how he knew something was going to happen. On the night of the murders, 
he’d been there and left. As outlandish as it sounded, Cummings was 
confident about all of this. “He knew more than anyone else.” 

I was flummoxed. For a year, I’d been hearing a rumor from people inside 
and outside the case: that Manson had visited the Cielo house after the 
murders, that he’d gone back with someone unknown to rearrange the scene. 
This would’ve accounted for discrepancies in the positions of the bodies: the 
killers left them one way, and the police found them in another. There were 
pools of Tate’s and Sebring’s blood on the front porch, splatters on the 
walkway and the bushes. But according to the killers, neither Tate nor 
Sebring had ever left the living room, where they died. The coroner described 
blood smears on Tate’s body, as if she’d been dragged—again, never 
mentioned by the killers. Those in the area, including a private security 
officer, had heard gunshots and arguing hours after the killers said they’d left. 
And Manson himself had claimed on a few occasions that he’d gone back to 
the house with an unnamed individual to “see what my children did.” 

The mere mention of this claim made Bugliosi apoplectic. I’d seen a video 
in which another researcher had raised the possibility. An indignant Bugliosi 
asked: Why would Manson put himself at risk like that? He may have been 
crazy, but he wasn’t stupid. And when I asked Bugliosi about it at our first 
meeting, he refused even to consider the possibility, despite all the 


discrepancies. 

Now, though, here was Cummings, along with others, saying that Whitson 
had been at the Tate house after the murders but before the police. Here was 
Hatami, saying Whitson had called him that morning. Cummings said it was 
Whitson’s “biggest regret” that he hadn’t been able to prevent the slaughter. 
Maybe these were the words of a self-important liar, or maybe Manson was 
telling the truth about this return visit, and Whitson had been there, too. That 
seemed delusional to me. But Cummings and Hatami weren’t crazy. They 
were two independent, credible sources with the same story. 

It seemed possible to me that Whitson was the fulcrum, the man who 
could connect everything. The strange omissions at the trial and in Helter 
Skelter; the blatant failures of LASO to follow up on good leads; the 
suspicion that Manson could be an informant; the murmurs about a narcotics 
deal gone south: if I wanted to construct a unified field theory, Whitson, 
linked to intelligence work by no fewer than a dozen sources, would have to 
be at the center. Knowing that a lot of what I had was circumstantial and 
speculative, I contained myself—I had a ton of work ahead of me. But, 
looking back, when I wonder how I let this case consume me for the better 
part of twenty years, I can point to Whitson as a major cause. 


“He Did Not Exist” 


The vital records on Whitson were thin. Born in Chicago on March 25, 1931, 
he’d grown up in Kendallville, Indiana, and even his childhood had a whiff of 
the fanciful to it. His mother was a dancer, and his father was a world- 
renowned acrobat, part of a traveling family act. An only child, he developed 
a flair for the dramatic. At the University of Indiana, he was the lead in 
school plays, and he so enjoyed acting that he transferred to the Pasadena 
Playhouse, moving to L.A. and hoping, like so many before him, to become 
an actor or a singer. As a friend put it: “His great strength was his natural 
affinity for people... He could play all these roles. His life really was a series 
of theatrical productions.” 

It’s not clear when that life swerved into espionage. According to a few 
people I spoke with, Whitson said that he’d had a mentor, Pete Lewis, who’d 
inducted him into undercover work. Lewis apparently met a tragic and deeply 


improbable end, like something out of a James Bond movie: he was killed by 
a poison dart hidden in an umbrella. Richard Edlund, one of several to 
mention the poison-dart story, saw it as a vital part of Whitson’s origin story; 
it was almost like Whitson thought he could avenge his friend’s death by 
working as a spy. Who could say how much of it was true? My hope was that 
Whitson’s family could separate fact from fiction. 

A few of the people I’d met in California told me that he had a Swedish 
ex-wife, as well as a daughter. Their very existence was speculative, because 
he was so reluctant to disclose anything about them. The family had lived 
together in America briefly, until, in 1962, after the Cuban Missile Crisis 
came to a head, he’d sent them back to Sweden, certain that the United States 
was on the brink of nuclear war. All of this sounded far-fetched to me, too, 
but what didn’t, with Whitson? 

Sure enough, I reached his ex-wife, Ellen Josefson (née Nylund), by 
phone in Sweden. Josefson didn’t beat around the bush. 

“He was working for the CIA,” she said. “That is why I am worried to talk 
to you.” 

Was she sure about that? 

“Yes, Iam sure.” She and Reeve had met in Sweden in ’61, she explained. 
They fell in love in an instant. Before the end of the year they’d married and 
moved to New York. In those days he was undercover as a journalist, 
producing pro-Communist pieces as a ploy to meet radicals. This, he seems 
to have hoped, would lead to more contacts in Russia. It was a scheme so 
elaborate that someone from the Polish embassy was involved, she 
remembered, and in due time Whitson was bringing Russians to their place. 

“I got furious with him,” she said. “I was very anti-Communist.” How 
could she have married a pinko? That’s when Whitson felt he had to pull the 
curtain back. He explained that it was just part of his work for the agency— 
something he was otherwise ill inclined to discuss. 

In October 1962, Josefson said, she gave birth to their daughter, Liza. By 
then, she had misgivings about her marriage; the bloom was off the rose. 
Reeve’s job jeopardized her life, and now her daughter’s, too. And it made 
him hard to love. He would be dispatched to remote areas of the world for 
months at a time, returning with no explanation for where he’d been or what 
he’d been doing. In 1962, he was always going off to Cuba, and after the 
missile crisis he decided it would be best to send his family back to Sweden. 


They returned to Ellen’s homeland sometime before JFK died, as she 
recalled. And then—radio silence. 

“T didn’t hear anything from him,” Ellen said. When he did resurface, it 
was to demand a divorce. The legalities dragged on for two or three years. “I 
had to be nice,” she said. “He said that things could happen to me if I didn’t 
divorce him.” 

After the divorce was finalized, neither she nor Liza heard from Whitson 
for some fifteen years. He reappeared in the late seventies or early eighties, 
saying that he’d retired and that he wanted to atone in some way for his 
absence. Although they spoke only a few more times, Ellen did remember his 
bringing up Manson and the Family. 

“He said that his mother and Sharon Tate’s mother were close,” she said, 
“and that’s why he had to go back to it, to help... I never wanted to have any 
details. I was scared. He said, ‘It’s best for you to not know.’” 

On Ellen’s advice, I got ahold of Liza, her daughter, who’d met Whitson 
for the first time since her infancy when she was eighteen. In several long 
phone calls, she filled in more biographical blanks about him. Now a married 
nurse living in Sweden, she had trouble reconciling her father’s intense 
secrecy with his role in her life. She found him inexplicable, opaque. 

“I could never understand how he got to know all these important people,” 
she told me. “He told me that he worked within the Central Intelligence 
Agency. And he was in a part of the agency that was absolutely nonexistent. 
He did not exist.” 

“Did you believe him?” 

“Yes,” she said. “My existence was kept a secret to all his friends.” When 
she made a trip to California to see him, he told some friends that she was 
coming. They “were absolutely convinced that he was just making a practical 
joke, like he always did. When I came through the door, I had two people just 
staring at me! They were so stunned.” Whitson told her that he’d kept her at 
arm’s length for so long because “he lived his life in complete control over 
other people, and I was the only one that he could not control.” If people 
wanted to hurt him, “they could get me,” she said. “My mother and my 
grandparents in Sweden feared that I was going to be kidnapped because I 
was his daughter.” Even after her father retired, they had a difficult 
relationship. He still wouldn’t discuss his past, and his politics bothered her 
—he was an archconservative with a rabid disdain for leftists. 


When Whitson died, Liza flew to Los Angeles to attend his funeral and 
was astonished to see how many powerful friends he had, and how few of 
them knew much about him beyond his or her personal experience. “He kept 
his friends apart,” she said. Hoping to recover any mementos, she went to his 
sparsely furnished apartment, finding nothing of any sentimental value. He 
did leave behind a few photos, which surprised her—Whitson had always 
refused to be photographed. One of them caught her off guard. It was a black- 
and-white picture of her father with long, flowing hair—not a wig, by all 
appearances—and bell-bottoms. “He looks like he could’ve been one of the 
Manson Family members,” she told me. 

She sent me the photograph, which, sure enough, showed a grimacing 
Whitson dressed as a hippie, not flamboyantly, but plausibly, in blue jeans 
and a wide belt, his shirt open at the neck. Liza was convinced that it was 
from one of his undercover operations. My impression was that the photo 
dated to about the mid-1960s; the cars in the background were from that 
period. I wondered if the disguise could have been related to Manson at all. 
She couldn’t say. Although he’d told her that he played some role in the case, 
“I never figured out why he was involved,” she said. “He was a master of 
telling you things but not really spelling it out.” 

Whitson had a large extended family. Many of his “cousins” weren’t even 
related by blood, but they’d bonded with him anyway. As Frank Rosenfelt 
told me, “He had a strange habit of getting in touch with people named 
Whitson and saying they were his cousins.” 

Linda Ruby, however, was a real cousin of his—Liza had put me in touch 
—and she presented another side of Whitson’s activities during and after the 
Tate murders. 

In August 1969, Ruby told me, Whitson was living with his parents in 
L.A. On the day the bodies were discovered at the Tate house, she said, he 
went missing. His father, her uncle Buddy, had told her this story. The 
morning after the murders—around the same time Whitson would’ve placed 
his call to Hatami—Buddy woke up and discovered that Reeve hadn’t come 
home that night. When news of the murders flashed on the radio, Buddy got 
nervous. He knew that Reeve had planned to visit the Cielo house the night 
before, and early reports said that one of the bodies there had yet to be 
identified. (It was Steven Parent, who wasn’t [Ded until eight that night.) 

Fearing that his son had been murdered, Buddy Whitson called the cops, 


who sprang into action. “The police set up a nerve center at their house,” 
Ruby said. They remained there, manning the telephones, until Reeve finally 
returned home late that night, at which point they eagerly debriefed him. 

Ruby couldn’t understand why the police would set up a command center 
at the home of an anonymous Los Angeles resident. Why not just check to 
see if the unidentified body was his? Making things weirder still, Whitson 
himself was present when his father told her the story—he was sitting right 
there, she remembered, quietly refusing to clarify or contribute. He never 
even said where he was during the hours he was missing. 

Another friend summed it up nicely: “He always wanted to go to 
restaurants that no one went to. He said, ‘I have to keep a low profile.’ It was 
so low that there was no profile.” 


“Mr. Anonymous” 


As usual, I was anxious to find some way to verify everything I’d heard. 
With Whitson, especially, my reporting had crossed the line into 
conspiratorial territory, and I would be hard-pressed to convert skeptics on 
the merits of my interviews alone. Of course, clandestine intelligence agents 
are exactly the sort of people who don’t leave a lot of paper behind, and 
Whitson, by all accounts, was so savvy that he didn’t need to take notes. I’d 
filed a Freedom of Information Act request (FOIA) with the CIA, asking for 
any information on him. Their response said that they could “neither confirm 
nor deny” Whitson’s connection to the agency. FOIA specialists told me that 
this is the closest one can get to confirmation that someone worked for the 
CIA. 

I did, eventually, find corroboration in print, but it came in a strange form: 
a manuscript for an unpublished book called Five Down on Cielo Drive. 
Written around 1974 or ’75—before Helter Skelter, and thus before 
Bugliosi’s telling of the Manson story had ossified into the “official” 
narrative—the book had a tortured history, not least because it involved at 
least three authors. The most prominent was Lieutenant Robert Helder, 
who’d headed the LAPD’s investigation into the Tate murders. Another 
contributor was Sharon Tate’s father, Colonel Paul Tate. The third author was 
Roger “Frenchie” LaJeunesse, an FBI agent who’d “unofficially” assisted the 


LAPD. 

It’s not hard to see the appeal of the book, especially before Helter 
Skelter. Here were three authorities on the case who could give a rich account 
of it when no such account existed. They secured a contract with a publisher. 
When too much time passed without a viable book, a ghostwriter came on 
board, but by the time the manuscript was ready, Bugliosi had beaten them to 
the punch, and Helter Skelter had claimed the mantle of “official” Manson 
book. The deal fell through. In the ensuing years, the Five Down manuscript 
gained a reputation among researchers and obsessives. It was exceptionally 
rare—hardly anyone other than its authors had read it—and even though it 
was apparently tedious, it was rumored to have the most complete account of 
the LAPD’s investigation, false leads and all. 

Another journalist passed me a copy. I read the parts about Colonel Tate 
especially closely. A retired military intelligence officer, Tate had mounted 
his own inquiry into his daughter’s death, separate from but parallel to the 
LAPD’s. Many had told me that Whitson was under his wing. You wouldn’t 
think that LAPD detectives would have been so keen on two outsiders 
helping them, especially given those outsiders’ connections to intelligence— 
but a LASO detective told me that Colonel Tate “appeared to be running the 
LAPD.” 

Then in his midforties, Tate had only recently left the army. To mount his 
“independent” investigation, he tried to masquerade as a_ laid-back 
Californian, growing a beard and long hair. But he retained the upright 
carriage of a military officer as he wandered into hippie clubs and drug dens 
in search of his daughter’s murderer, offering a lavish reward to anyone who 
would help. 

How did Whitson play into this? The Five Down manuscript refers to a 
Walter Kern, “a somewhat shady character who can best be described as a 
‘police groupie.’ Apparently he had been a friend of Jay Sebring... and 
wanted to help in any way he could.” “Kern” was always one step ahead of 
the other investigators. Helder wrote, “In this business, as you might imagine, 
a policeman gets to meet many strange people. Kern was among the 
strangest. No one knew what he did for a living, yet he always seemed to 
have money and knew just about everyone on the wrong side of the tracks. I 
didn’t like him but he was useful.” 

And he kept popping up. When Helder arrived to interview Roman 


Polanski at the Paramount lot where he was sequestered with Witold 
Kaczanowski, Kern was there, “lurking in the shadows. He sure did get 
around.” Believing that Voytek Frykowski was involved with drug dealers 
who may have murdered him, Helder instructed Kern to cozy up to anyone 
who might know them, especially those in Mama Cass’s circle. 

In another section of the manuscript, a “Hollywood hooker” is said to 
have spoken to Kern, “who by now was well-known as an amateur sleuth on 
the case.” Kern shared leads and took orders, and yet the man was so 
shrouded in mystery that Helder referred to him as “Mr. Anonymous.” 

It seemed likely to me that there was more to “Mr. Anonymous” than 
Helder had shared. By that point, Helder had died, but I’d already spoken to 
Frenchie LaJeunesse, the FBI agent who’d contributed to Five Down. I called 
him again to ask whether Walter Kern was really Reeve Whitson. 

His answer: “Yes.” In fact, the publishing deal couldn’t have happened 
without Whitson, LaJeunesse said. “Reeve Whitson was a part of putting the 
book together, the linchpin between all of us.” 

It was Lieutenant Helder, the lead investigator for the LAPD, who’d 
assigned Whitson the pseudonym of Walter Kern, to protect his undercover 
status—hardly a step one would take with an ordinary “amateur sleuth.” 
“Reeve didn’t want his name associated with a book,” LaJeunesse said, even 
long after the Manson case had been solved. “Not on the jacket, not even in 
contracts—he didn’t even want money.” 

In effect, I now had written proof from the LAPD’s head investigator, and 
from Sharon Tate’s own father, that Reeve Whitson was smack in the middle 
of the Manson investigation from the start. LaJeunesse didn’t know who 
Whitson worked for, just that he was an “astounding fellow” who’d been an 
informant of some kind. He “wanted to project an aura of mystery,” 
LaJeunesse said. But the heart of his motivation was an antidrug 
conservatism. He was “interested in keeping young people away from the 
curse of narcotics.” 

Mike McGann, the LAPD detective whom I’d interviewed about the early 
days of the investigation, remembered Whitson’s involvement, too. 

“He was heavily involved,’ McGann said. “And he had no need for 
money.” McGann was nearly certain that Whitson was in the CIA, and found 
him “very credible.” Still, when I said that Whitson had reportedly believed 
he could’ve stopped the murders, McGann laughed. “Bullshit. He’d talk for 


three hours and never say anything. Typical government employee—a real 
good line of bullshit.” 


If I could prove once and for all that Whitson was working for the CIA, even 
McGann might admit I had a story on my hands. The CIA wasn’t even 
supposed to operate on domestic soil. What could they have been doing 
messing around with an acid-soaked cult in Los Angeles? And if Whitson 
had been close enough to the murders to stop them, why didn’t he? 

Everyone agreed that Paul Tate was the key to understanding Whitson. I 
knew that Tate was still alive, but getting him to open up would be a long 
shot. 

His wife and Sharon’s mother, Doris, had been comfortable discussing the 
murder. She’d formed a national victims’ rights advocacy group and 
mobilized it whenever anyone from the Family was eligible for parole. Her 
friends said she believed there was something deeper than Helter Skelter 
behind the murders. Like her husband, she’d conducted her own investigation 
through the years, becoming convinced that the Cielo house was under 
surveillance by some type of law enforcement at the time of the murders. 
(Whether she knew that Reeve Whitson had claimed to be watching the 
house, we’ll never know.) She was also sure that her daughter wasn’t 
supposed to be home when the killers arrived that night. Whoever was 
watching the house, she believed, had noticed that Sharon’s red Ferrari 
wasn’t in the driveway—it was in the repair shop—and concluded that she 
wasn’t there. She’d planned to write a book about her theories, but she never 
got to: she was diagnosed with cancer and died in 1992. 

Paul Tate, rumor had it, had never discussed the case with his wife. 
Before she died, they’d barely spoken to each other, having taken up in 
separate parts of their house. He hadn’t spoken publicly about Sharon’s death 
since Manson had been captured, and he’d already declined an interview with 
me once. But I phoned him again in May 2000, telling him I’d gotten a copy 
of Five Down on Cielo Drive and planned to quote it. 

That got him to agree to meet with me. But as the date approached, he 
canceled on me; we rescheduled, and he canceled again. When he called to 
cancel yet another meeting, I tried to butt in with a question about Reeve 
Whitson before he could get off the phone. He was receptive—at first, 


anyway. 

“Reeve was my main person to help me,” Tate said. “He’s been a friend 
of Roman Polanski and Sharon and mine and Jay Sebring... He was very, 
very helpful.” 

Even so, Tate found it ridiculous that Whitson’s friends were going 
around saying that he could have prevented the murders. That simply wasn’t 
true, he said. Could he help me clear it up, having contributed so much to the 
investigation? 

“I contributed, just—put in there I contributed nothing.” 

“But you were involved in the investigation,” I said. “You wrote a book 
about it!” 

“Yeah, well...” 

“Did you ask Reeve to do the undercover work or did someone else?” 

“Tm not gonna answer those questions,” he said, impatience creeping into 
his voice. 

Could he at least tell me who Whitson worked for? He refused. 

“Why not?” 

“I don’t have to tell you that!” he nearly shouted. 

Out of desperation, I made a foolish mistake. Sometimes, when I sensed 
that someone was withholding something sensitive, I’d remind the person 
that, in all the speculation about Manson himself, the basic, brutal loss of 
human life was too often the first thing people stopped thinking about. So I 
said, “Just out of respect to the victims, don’t you think—” 

Paul Tate sounded a million miles away to me, and he had a gruff, 
emotionally detached tone befitting his military background. But he was, first 
and foremost, Sharon Tate’s father: a man who’d lost a child to an 
unimaginable horror, who’d seen her death become a kind of shorthand for 
tabloid atrocities. I’d forgotten that truth, and my comment understandably 
upset him. I regretted it right away. 

“Out of respect for the victims!” he shouted. “What kind of fuck do you 
think I am?” He laughed bitterly. “You go ahead and do whatever you want 
to do, but... if any son of a bitch ever had respect for the victims, it was me.” 

“I apologize,” I said. “I didn’t mean it to sound the way it came out.” 

“Okay,” he said. “Bye, bye.” And that was the end of my relationship with 
Paul Tate, the man who knew better than anyone what Reeve Whitson was up 
to. He died in 2005. 


The Spy Who Came in from the Cold 


Helder had written that Whitson “knew just about everyone on the wrong 
side of the tracks.” The opposite was true, too—he knew how to pull the 
levers of power. Colonel Tate was just one of his friends in high places. 
Usually, in the same breath, Whitson’s friends named another military 
bigwig: General Curtis LeMay. 

As discussed earlier, LeMay was part of the unsettling story I’d heard 
from Jay Sebring’s barber, Little Joe. One of Sebring’s clients, the mobster 
Charlie Baron, had called Joe after Sebring’s murder, pledging that no harm 
would come to the barber. Charlie Baron was a friend of Curtis LeMay, too. 
Meetings between the two were noted by the FBI, who surveilled Baron for 
decades. LeMay, a former air-force officer nicknamed “Bombs Away 
LeMay,” had retired in ’65 and turned to defense contracting, where one 
critic feared that he “could be more dangerous than when he was air force 
chief of staff.” He moved to L.A. to become the vice president of a missile- 
parts manufacturer, but it fizzled, as did LeMay’s brief political career. After 
that, Mr. Bombs Away had spent his retirement roaming the city with Mr. 
Anonymous. 

I added a few more connective arrows to the big whiteboard on my wall, 
realizing more than ever that its tangle of lines and circles made sense only to 
me. Though I never figured out what LeMay and Whitson got up to together, 
it was plausible that they were tied up in Charlie Baron’s cabal of right-wing 
Hollywood friends, the ones who, Little Joe told me, had “done terrible 
things to black people.” (George Wallace, who’d chosen LeMay as his 
running mate in his ’68 presidential bid, was among the nation’s most 
notorious racists.) 

“T’m sure he knew Baron,” Whitson’s friend John Irvin told me. A British 
film director who himself claimed to have ties to MI5, Irvin said that Whitson 
got meetings “within minutes” at “the highest levels of the defense industry 
—it was amazing.” He was “on the fringes of very far-out research” for the 
government, “not discussed openly because it verges on the occult.” He 
added that Whitson “had very good connections with the Los Angeles 
Sheriff’s Office” and pull with immigration officials, as Shahrokh Hatami 


had said. But Irvin couldn’t elaborate on any of this. 

Then came Otto and Ilse Skorzeny, the most sinister of Whitson’s friends. 
They were Nazis—genuine, German, dyed-in-the-wool Nazis. The United 
Nations listed Otto Skorzeny as a war criminal. He’d been one of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]’s 
most trusted operatives, leading the manhunt of one of the Führer’s would-be 
assassins and spearheading a secret mission to rescue Mussolini. After the 
Third Reich fell, Skorzeny safeguarded the wealth of countless Nazis and 
helped disgraced war criminals settle into new lives around the world. 
Brought to trial before a U.S. military court, Skorzeny was alleged to be “the 
most dangerous man in Europe”—but he was acquitted, having made himself 
an asset to U.S. intelligence. His wife, the Countess Ilse von Finkelstein, was 
once a member of the [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] Youth; a shrewd businesswoman known for her 
beauty and charm, she negotiated arms deals and contracts for German 
engineering companies. Irvin had met Ilse many times through Whitson. 
When she got drunk, he said, “she was always doing Heil Hitler salutes!” 

Whitson could look past any ideology, no matter how abhorrent, if 
someone proved useful to him. His friends construed him as the purest form 
of Cold Warrior, lifted from The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. He carried 
an outmoded fifties-era politics into the future, masquerading as a hippie, 
infiltrating an LSD cult, and befriending Nazis to eliminate the scourge of 
communism and narcotics—the latter being, to his mind, a direct extension of 
the former. 

“He believed there was an operation to destabilize American youth,” one 
friend told me. “Russians were bringing drugs in to battle the American 
system from within.” 

Having worked in South America, Whitson believed “we should kill the 
drug lords in Bolivia and their whole families... If there’s a baby, you kill the 
baby. I don’t think he would say something like that and not be capable of 
doing it. He didn’t believe in the individual, but in the larger picture.” 
Another acquaintance recalled, “The entire Manson situation, the Black 
Panther movement, and probably similar other movements... people like that 
were discredited by certain things that, according to Reeve, may have been 
staged or done by government authorities in order to make them look bad.” 

If I could find out where Whitson’s money came from, I might be closer 
to understanding what he actually did. His résumé was scant from the fifties 
through the seventies, after which it covered more ground than seemed 


possible for a single life. He was the special advisor to the chairman of the 
board of Thyssen, among the largest corporations in Germany. He sank years 
into a scheme to construct a maglev monorail train stretching from Las Vegas 
to Pasadena. He wanted to build a Brigadoon theme park in Scotland. He was 
involved in weapons manufacturing, early iterations of the Miss Universe 
pageant, and a new variety of childproof medicine bottle. And he had a 
passion for race cars—building them, selling them, driving them—which 
may explain how he befriended Jay Sebring, another racing enthusiast. 

These ventures had one thing in common: they fell through. The easiest 
explanation, of course, was that they were covers, and sometimes Whitson 
told his friends as much. So where did his money come from? No one knew. 
He always paid in cash—he stowed it in his freezer—and when he had it, he 
was quick to settle a tab. Whitson dressed in gabardine suits, but for much of 
his adult life, an ex-girlfriend recalled, he lived “like a hermit,” sleeping “on 
a cot in his parents’ kitchen.” The man who loved fast cars drove an 
economical Ford Pinto. 

In his final years, Whitson was destitute and disgruntled, telling rueful 
stories of the “Quarry”—his term for the section of the CIA he worked for— 
and trash-talking the agency. Once you’re in, he told one friend, “You really 
are a pawn.” In his dying days, the government had said, “You didn’t even 
exist to us.” Even the movies were no reprieve, offering reminders of his 
glory days. About a year before he died, seeing the thriller The Pelican Brief, 
Whitson leaned over in the dark of the cinema and told a friend, “J wrote the 
yellow papers on everything that happened.” With a hint of nostalgia, he 
explained that “yellow papers” detailed interrogation techniques, including a 
procedure in which a man had a plastic tube inserted in his rectum, peanut 
butter smeared on his scrotum, and a rat dropped in the tube. 

Whitson died at the relatively young age of sixty-three. With no health 
insurance, he left behind an enormous unpaid hospital bill, something to the 
tune of half a million dollars. A few of my sources felt there may have been 
foul play. He’d given conflicting explanations for his health problems: a heart 
attack, or a spider bite, or a brain tumor, or lymphoma. “I think he committed 
suicide,” his daughter told me. “His greatest fear was to be a vegetable.” 


Coda: Neither Confirm nor Deny 


Reeve Whitson “was a walk-in,” as one of my sources put it, “an 
extraterrestrial.” Once he consumed me, I found myself fixating on 
possibilities that I would’ve dismissed as insane only months before. His life 
opened onto a vantage of intrigue, where Manson and the sixties 
counterculture were just one element in a political struggle that encompassed 
Nazis, Cuba, Vietnam, South America, military intelligence, and byzantine 
matters of national security. 

But Whitson was too much the mystery man he was said to be. He 
brought my reporting to a standstill. At a certain point, I felt I’d learned 
everything I could about him without tapping official sources. I’d attempted 
to find his tax records and asked reporters with stronger connections at 
Langley if they could look him up. They never found anything. FOIAs to the 
FBI, the Secret Service, the DEA, the ATF, the IRS, and the military all got 
responses that said they’d had nothing to do with him. It was only the CIA 
that gave me the “neither confirm nor deny” response. Later, responding to 
my appeal, it wrote that Whitson had “no open or officially acknowledged 
relationship with the Central Intelligence Agency.” 

I worry that Pll never know the truth about Reeve Whitson. There is, of 
course, the possibility that he was little more than an effective con artist, 
someone who weaseled his way into a minor role in the Manson investigation 
by sweet-talking people in power. Someone who’s constantly implying to his 
friends that he’s in the CIA might not be very effective as an undercover 
agent. If Whitson were truly a high-functioning member of the intelligence 
community, would anyone have had any idea? 

On the other hand, maybe the stories I heard are fundamentally correct— 
Whitson was an intelligence agent who led a storied international career, and 
he wasn’t exaggerating when he said that he could’ve stopped the Manson 
murders. If that was true—what then? Why would the CIA, or any 
intelligence group, have had Whitson infiltrate the Family, and what did 
Manson know about it? The bottom line was that I’d learned just enough 
about Whitson to dwell on him. It was as his daughter said: “He gives a little 
and then he goes away.”

Neutralizing the Left 


Dawn of the “Campus Malcontents” 


I couldn’t expect to report on the likes of Reeve Whitson, or on outrageous 
claims about intelligence connections and military figures, until I learned 
more about the politics and pressures of California in the sixties. My research 
was pushing me toward broader connections and social implications, and I 
didn’t always know what to do with them. If Preston Guillory was correct, for 
instance, then LASO knew about Manson’s plan to attack the Black Panthers. 
How could the police have known, and why would they have wanted that 
attack to happen? I had vague notions of the tension between the Panthers 
and the government, but I couldn’t say how it fit in the larger context of 
protest in the sixties, when the nation’s unrest had crystallized in California. 
The state was the epicenter of the summer of love, but it had also seen the 
ascent of Reagan and Nixon. It had seen the Watts riots, the birth of the 
antiwar movement, and the Altamont concert disaster, the Free Speech 
movement and the Hells Angels. Here, defense contractors, Cold Warriors, 
and nascent tech companies lived just down the road from hippie communes, 
love-ins, and surf shops. 

If there was any truth to Reeve Whitson’s story, I needed a crash course in 
the government’s involvement in antileft action in California, and solid 
sources to tell me how Manson could have been swept up in it. I focused on 
two secret intelligence operations that were under way in Los Angeles in 
1969: the FBI’s COINTELPRO and the CIA’s CHAOS. Their primary 
objective, according to three congressional committees that investigated them 


in the midseventies, was to discredit the left-wing movement by any means 
necessary—an aim that, coincidentally or not, described exactly the effect of 
the Manson murders. 


The sixties youth movement was born on May 13, 1960, when hundreds of 
demonstrators, most of them UC Berkeley students, began a two-day protest 
at San Francisco’s City Hall. The House Committee on Un-American 
Activities (HCUA) had convened a series of hearings there, and students 
were chagrined to learn that they were barred from the proceedings. A riot 
broke out as police turned firehoses on the protesters, the intense pressure 
forcing them down the building’s imposing marble stairway. Police clubbed 
protesters and made sixty-one arrests, including more than thirty students. 

“Black Friday,” as it came to be known, marked the end of the fifties, the 
dawn of a new age of dissent. The following day, the demonstrators returned 
undeterred, this time totaling more than five thousand. The HCUA was 
cowed—never again did it conduct hearings beyond the Capitol. J. Edgar 
Hoover, the director of the FBI, couldn’t believe the left had such strength in 
numbers. He was convinced that foreign Communists sponsored the 
movement. Thus began a pitched battle between federal law enforcement and 
young “subversives.” 

In the midsixties, with the war in Vietnam escalating, Berkeley became a 
hotbed of antiwar activity. Sit-ins were staged on campus; rallies were held 
throughout the Bay Area, each growing in size and fervor. Late in 1964, 
some fifteen hundred students crowded into Berkeley’s Sproul Hall to protest 
the university’s mistreatment of campus activists. More than seven hundred 
of them were arrested that day. 

On January 28, 1965, a distraught Hoover met with the director of the 
CIA, John McCone, hatching a plan to take “corrective action” at Berkeley. 
The CIA’s charter prohibited the agency from domestic operations, but 
McCone collaborated with Hoover nonetheless, hoping to quash the protests. 
One of their targets was Clark Kerr, the president of UC Berkeley, who was 
widely perceived as sympathetic to the protesters. McCone and Hoover 
circulated false information claiming that he had Communist ties. They also 
targeted faculty supporters of the demonstrators and the student leaders 
themselves. 


A few months later, McCone resigned from the CIA, having felt 
unappreciated by President Lyndon Johnson. His next job brought him back 
to California: he took a post on Ronald Reagan’s gubernatorial campaign, 
shoring up the candidate’s credibility with right-leaning voters. Reagan 
campaigned fervently against “the so-called New Left,” vowing a swift end to 
California’s burgeoning antiwar movement. Without citing evidence, he 
claimed that Berkeley had suffered reduced enrollment as a result of the 
protesters’ “destructive conduct.” If elected, he said, he would appoint 
McCone to lead a formal investigation of the wuniversity’s “campus 
malcontents and filthy speech advocates.” Reagan won by a landslide. As he 
cemented his power, antiwar sentiment continued to flower at Berkeley. In 
April 1970, soon to win a second term, Reagan famously declared war 
against the movement. “If it takes a bloodbath, let’s get it over with,” he 
announced. “No more appeasement.” 

The Oval Office was similarly disturbed by the rise of student activism. 
By 1967, Lyndon Johnson believed that the country was on the verge of a 
political revolution that could topple him from power. Having mired the 
nation even further in the Vietnam War, he faced constant jeers at rallies: 
“Hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?” As antiwar 
demonstrations spilled from campuses into the streets, Johnson ordered the 
FBI and the CIA to take action. That August, with the president’s approval, 
CIA director Richard Helms authorized an illegal domestic surveillance 
program, code-named CHAOS. Meanwhile, [[J Edgar Hoover]] revived the 
FBI’s dormant counterinsurgency program, COINTELPRO. Both agencies 
opened the first offices of their respective operations in San Francisco—still 
considered ground zero for the revolution, especially since the founding of 
the Black Panther party in nearby Oakland the previous summer. 

Thanks to these two secret programs and their network of well-placed 
informants, there was an all-out war raging in California by the summer of 
°69. The FBI and CIA had induced the left to feed on itself; among 
competing factions, what had been sectarian strife had devolved into outright 
violence. The more I read about it, the more I saw how someone like Charles 
Manson could fit into a scheme like this. I was only speculating, but I knew 
that he’d spent a lot of time in Berkeley, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, 
often inveighing against the Black Panthers; and I had reliable sources 
suggesting that he was an informant, or at least hanging around with others 


who could’ve been. 

It struck me that the Tate—LaBianca murders had been so often invoked as 
the death knell of the sixties. Arguably, they did more than any other event to 
turn the public opinion against hippies, recasting the peace-and-love flower- 
power ethos as a thing of latent, drug-addled criminality. As the writer Todd 
Gitlin noted, “For the mass media, the acid-head Charles Manson was 
readymade as the monster lurking in the heart of every longhair.” Wasn’t this 
the goal of CHAOS and COINTELPRO? 

It was a sound connection in theory. To report it, to take it out of the 
realm of the hypothetical, seemed an impossible task for someone with no 
background in national security. But I had to try. And so, feeling the line 
between “researcher” and “conspiracy theorist” blurring before me, I 
hunkered down in the library to read about the many ways our government 
has deceived us. 


“Fomenting Violence and Unrest” 


The FBI and the CIA launched their counterintelligence programs in the same 
month. On August 25, 1967, [[J Edgar Hoover]] issued a memorandum to the 
chiefs of each of his FBI field offices in the United States, outlining the 
objective of COINTELPRO. (The name was an abridgment of Counter 
Intelligence Program.) First launched in 1956 to “increase factionalism” 
among Communists in the United States, COINTELPRO had been activated 
on and off throughout the early sixties, often to vilify civil rights leaders— 
Martin Luther King Jr. most prominent among them. In his ’67 memo, 
Hoover formed a new branch of the operation, aiming 


to expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize the 
activities of black nationalist, hate-type organizations... The activities 
of all such groups of intelligence interest to this Bureau must be 
followed on a continuous basis... Efforts of various groups to 
consolidate their forces or to recruit new or youthful adherents must be 
frustrated. No opportunity should be missed to exploit... the 
organizational and personal conflicts of the leaderships of the 
groups... [and] to capitalize upon existing conflicts between 


competing black nationalist organizations. 


Hoover specified more than twenty cities where COINTELPRO methods 
could be put to effective use, Los Angeles among them. In a later memo, he 
ordered the Bureau to “pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them 
before they exercised their potential for violence.” 

Informants were COINTELPRO’s lifeblood, providing the only effective 
way for the FBI to learn about, and exert influence on, the groups it hoped to 
discredit. The Bureau went to extreme lengths to cultivate solid informants; if 
it found a convict willing to infiltrate a political group, it would commute his 
prison sentence. In Quantico, Virginia, at the sprawling marine corps base 
where the FBI would soon open its own academy, a less-formal “Hoover 
University” trained agents in the delicate art of passing as leftists. They grew 
unkempt beards, refrained from bathing for days at a time, parroted radical 
talking points, got stoned, and tripped on acid. 

In the Black Panther party and, in Los Angeles, the US Organization, 
informants were instrumental in fomenting violence. They would spread 
disinformation to catalyze an intergroup rivalry, or they’d simply arrange for 
the bloodshed themselves. 

Founded by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale in Oakland in 1966, the Black 
Panther Party for Self Defense (commonly known as the Black Panther party) 
had become the béte noire of federal law enforcement. From Hoover on 
down, the FBI’s ranks saw the group as a threat to the national order rivaled 
only by communism and nuclear holocaust. Originally, the Panthers served to 
safeguard Oakland’s black residents from overzealous policing. They 
promoted lawful, armed self-defense in inner-city neighborhoods, and their 
social outreach programs brought meals and health care to those who 
couldn’t afford them. Their Ten-Point Program demanded “power to 
determine the destiny of our Black Community.” 

But as the party grew in size and prominence, opening chapters in nearly 
every major city in the United States and abroad, it embraced more militant 
action against the long arm of law enforcement, starting in Oakland. In 1967, 
Newton shot and killed a cop during a traffic stop. In ’68, Eldridge Cleaver, 
who headed the Panthers’ Ministry of Information, was in a firefight during 
which he and two cops suffered gunshot wounds and a seventeen-year-old 


Panther was killed. That same year, the violence found its way to Los 
Angeles, as gunfights led to four Panther deaths. 

By 1969, the Panthers had been involved in more than a dozen shoot-outs 
with police, some the result of ambushes. Fearing infiltration by informants, 
the party began to implode, purging members and, in one notorious case, 
torturing and killing a nineteen-year-old member suspected of being a snitch. 
Their paranoia was far from unfounded. Hoover’s FBI chalked up the internal 
strife, not to mention the rash of deaths, as a victory. 

COINTELPRO promised the violent repudiation of what Hoover had 
dubbed a “hate-type organization.” The Bureau’s strategy was merciless, its 
results disastrous but effective. In Chicago, famously, the FBI recruited 
William O’Neal, recently charged with impersonating a federal officer and 
driving a stolen car across state lines, to infiltrate the Panthers’ Illinois 
chapter, forgiving those charges in exchange for his services. Soon O’ Neal 
became the personal bodyguard for Fred Hampton, the chapter’s chairman. 
O’Neal’s post allowed him to provide the Bureau with a steady stream of 
intelligence, including detailed floor plans of Hampton’s apartment. 
Although he found no evidence that Hampton or the group posed a threat to 
anyone’s safety, O’Neal continued to inform. In December 1969—days, 
coincidentally, after Manson was charged in the Tate-LaBianca murders 
O’Neal slipped a barbiturate into Hampton’s drink over dinner. By the end of 
the night, the police had raided Hampton’s apartment and shot him twice in 
the head at point-blank range. 

O’Neal was one of many such informants around the country, and 
Hampton’s death one of many such deaths. The FBI’s role may never have 
come to light if not for the Citizens’ Committee to Investigate the FBI, an 
audacious crew of activist-burglars who took it upon themselves to break into 
a small FBI field office in Media, Pennsylvania, just west of Philadelphia. 
One night in March 1971, the group took a crowbar to that office’s dead- 
bolted door, stuffing suitcases with papers revealing the FBI’s domestic 
spying, which they soon parceled out to the press. 

Hoover was in high dudgeon: the group’s methods were straight out of the 
FBI playbook. They’d cased the office for months, sending in a woman 
disguised as a college student to get a sense of the building’s security. In his 
fury, Hoover allocated some two hundred agents to track down the burglars, 
but they were never found; only in 2014 did they reveal themselves. They 


were motivated, they said, by a sense that the government had lied to them 
about Vietnam, and that conventional protests had proven useless. 

The existence of COINTELPRO was the single most earthshaking 
revelation in the stolen documents, among which was Hoover’s incendiary 
°67 COINTELPRO memo, the one in which he pledged to “discredit” and 
“neutralize” leftist organizations. With his pet project exposed, Hoover took 
steps to end COINTELPRO. But the burglary inaugurated a spate of whistle- 
blowing that undermined the FBI’s credibility over the next few years. 
Congressman Hale Boggs, the House Majority Leader, compared the FBI to 
the “secret police,” conceding that even Congress lived in fear of them, and 
that they’d “hastened the growth of a vine of tyranny.” Lawsuits brought 
under the Freedom of Information Act forced the attorney general to reveal 
more incriminating FBI files. By 1975, anti-intelligence sentiment was so 
high that Congress formed a committee to scrutinize the Bureau. 

Led by Senator Frank Church, of Idaho, the committee’s investigation 
exposed FBI duplicity on a scale that had been unthinkable even after the 
Pennsylvania burglary. The Church Committee’s findings, published in ’76, 
gave the nation its first glimpse of the astonishing success that Hoover’s 
counterintelligence operation had seen. As reported in the New York Times 
that May, the committee’s final report determined that “FBI headquarters 
approved more than 2,300 actions in a campaign to disrupt and discredit 
American organizations ranging from the Black Panthers to Antioch 
College,” and that the Bureau “may have violated specific criminal statutes” 
in pursuing actions that “involved risk of serious bodily injury or death to 
targets.” 

The Church Committee noted that COINTELPRO encompassed “a 
staggering range of targets,” and that the FBI’s deployment of “dangerous, 
degrading, or blatantly unconstitutional techniques appears to have become 
less restrained with each subsequent program.” Hoover had specifically 
requested that these techniques be “imaginative and hard-hitting,” and they 
were—the FBI tried seemingly everything, from gossip to gunfights. The 
Bureau mailed pejorative articles and newspaper clippings to college 
administrators. Its agents tried to destroy marriages by writing unsigned, 
malicious, rumor-mongering letters. They smeared leftists as informants 
when they weren’t, and they stoked the flames of internecine conflicts until 
they grew into feuds. 


The committee detailed several of the FBI’s exploits in Los Angeles, and 
by now I wasn’t surprised by the scope of the mayhem. The operations 
described, especially the deadly ones, were equal parts sophisticated and 
reckless, with the Bureau taking great pains to install informants and incite 
violence with no care for the consequences. I looked for any signs of 
Manson, no matter how tangential—any pattern among law enforcement, any 
familiar name. 

The most conspiratorial possibility, of course, would be that the FBI had 
carefully groomed Manson and pressed him into service as a COINTELPRO 
informant—but I knew that was the longest of long shots, and if the facts 
didn’t lead me there, I had no desire to force the connection. Given the FBI’s 
sloppiness, I wondered if Manson could have been implicated in other, more 
indirect ways, willingly or not. Maybe he wasn’t an informant but had been 
close to someone who was; maybe someone like Reeve Whitson had 
influenced his actions from two or three degrees of removal; maybe someone 
at the sheriff’s office had assisted the FBI. 

I was encouraged by one simple fact: the FBI had behaved 
conspiratorially with COINTELPRO, early and often. One of its greatest 
coups came in January 1969, when G-men had incited the murders of two 
Black Panthers on the UCLA campus. FBI infiltrators had lied to the 
Panthers’ rivals, the US Organization, telling them that the Panthers were 
meeting on the campus to plan their assassinations. US responded by 
ambushing two Panthers at a Black Student Union meeting and shooting 
them dead. 

LASO knew that the Panthers were murdered because of the FBI’s 
meddling. They didn’t care. In fact, they hid the FBI’s role in the violence. In 
their eyes, the most desirable outcome had been achieved: two Panthers were 
dead, three US gang members were in jail, and the American public was 
more fearful of black militants. The FBI used the incident to spur more 
violence between US and the Panthers, according to a 1970 memo from the 
Los Angeles Field Office: 


The Los Angeles Division is aware of mutually hostile feelings 
harbored between the organizations and the first opportunity to 
capitalize on the situation will be maximized. It is intended that the US 


Inc. will be appropriately and discreetly advised of the time and 
location of BPP [Black Panther party] activities in order that the two 
organizations might be brought together and thus grant nature the 
opportunity to take her due course. 


That emphasis comes from the Church Committee, who noted that “due 
course,” in this case, meant nothing less than first-degree murder. The 
committee’s final report blasted the FBI for its complicity in the deaths of the 
Panthers. “The chief investigative branch of the Federal Government engaged 
in lawless tactics and responded to deep-seated social problems by fomenting 
violence and unrest,” it wrote. “Equally disturbing is the pride which those 
officials took in claiming credit for the bloodshed that occurred.” 

Indeed, it seemed that whenever the FBI made headway with its tactics, it 
doubled down. Rather than halt its provocations as the Panthers and the US 
Organization claimed each other’s lives, the FBI escalated the campaign, 
spreading propaganda, including political cartoons, designed to inflame the 
violence. “The FBI viewed this carnage as a positive development,” the 
Church Committee wrote. 

Maybe the most lacerating testimony came from William Sullivan, a high- 
ranking FBI official who’d helped implement COINTELPRO before Hoover 
fired him in 1971. Sullivan had masterminded an episode in which Coretta 
Scott King, Martin Luther King Jr.’s wife, received a recording in which her 
husband could be heard flirting with other women. Sullivan had deemed King 
“a fraud, demagogue, and scoundrel.” Now, before the Church Committee, he 
allowed that the FBI’s ruthless pragmatism had obscured any sense of 
morality he and his colleagues might’ve had. “Never once,” he said, “did I 
hear anybody, including myself, raise the question: ‘Is this course of action 
which we have agreed upon lawful? Is it legal? Is it ethical or moral?’... The 
one thing we were concerned about was this: ‘Will this course of action 
work? Will it get us what we want?’” 

COINTELPRO’s excesses were well documented, but the FBI’s director 
—Clarence M. Kelley, who’d succeeded Hoover—refused to admit 
wrongdoing, defending the operations as a necessary precaution against 
violent extremists who hoped to “bring America to its knees.” He added, “For 
the FBI to have done less under the circumstances would have been an 


abdication of its responsibilities to the American people.” 


“Lined Up Against the Wall with the Rest of the Whites” 


When Hoover reconstituted COINTELPRO, he was already worried that 
America’s black militants would be embraced by liberal whites, especially in 
a left-leaning place like Hollywood. In the August 1967 memo reanimating 
the counterintelligence program, he’d noted the importance of “prevent[ing |] 
militant Black Nationalist groups and leaders from gaining respectability”: 
“they must be discredited to the white community, both the responsible 
community and to the ‘liberals’ who have vestiges of sympathy for militant 
black nationalists simply because they are Negroes.” 

Two years later, the Panthers had become almost synonymous with 
Hollywood’s liberal elite. Actresses such as Jane Fonda and Jean Seberg 
appeared at their rallies. Hoover felt he had to widen the chasm between 
blacks and whites in Los Angeles. In a November 1968 memo, an L.A. field 
agent discussed new efforts to spread disinformation to Hollywood’s liberal 
whites. 

In the context of the Tate-LaBianca murders, the memo is chilling. 
Remember, the Tate house by then had become a high-profile gathering place 
for liberal Hollywood—among others, for Fonda, Cass Elliot, and Warren 
Beatty, all three of whom were under FBI surveillance. Abigail Folger, who 
would die at the hands of the Family, was an outspoken civil rights activist. 
That year she campaigned for Tom Bradley, the first African American 
candidate for mayor of Los Angeles. Many in the Polanski—Tate crowd 
belonged to the White Panther party, explicit allies of the Black Panthers, or 
to the Peace and Freedom Party of California, which also voiced its support. 
The FBI, according to the memo, planned to generate distrust through 
disinformation: 


The Peace and Freedom Party (PFP) has been furnishing the BPP with 
financial assistance. An anonymous letter is being prepared for Bureau 
approval to be sent to a leader of PFP in which it is set forth that the 
BPP has made statements in closed meetings that when the armed 
rebellion comes the whites in the PFP will be lined up against the wall 


with the rest of the whites. 


Emphasis mine. The FBI would make it seem as if even sympathetic leftists 
were in the Panthers’ crosshairs. Less than a year after this memo was 
written, Manson’s followers lined up four denizens of liberal Hollywood in 
Roman Polanski’s home and cut them to pieces, leaving slogans in blood to 
implicate the Black Panthers. 


Of course, the FBI couldn’t have done this work alone. They needed local 
law enforcement on their side, and, according to the Church Committee, they 
got it. 

The committee looked into one of the most notorious COINTELPRO 
actions in L.A., the framing of Gerard “Geronimo” Pratt, a Black Panther and 
a decorated Vietnam vet. Pratt would be imprisoned for twenty-seven years 
for a murder the FBI knew he didn’t commit. He was in Oakland at the time 
of the crime, four hundred miles away, at a Black Panther house that the 
Bureau had wiretapped. It had transcripts of a call he’d made to the Panther 
headquarters in Los Angeles just hours before the murder. Still, Bureau 
agents enlisted a federal informant to lie on the stand about Pratt’s 
involvement. Even before the frame-up, FBI gunmen had attempted to kill 
Pratt by shooting at him through the window of his apartment; he survived 
only because a spine injury he’d sustained in the war made it more 
comfortable to sleep on the floor. 

Pratt was serving a life sentence when the Church Committee released its 
landmark findings, confirming what he’d long suspected: LASO and the 
LAPD were complicit in the COINTELPRO operation. The committee 
quoted a report that the FBI’s Los Angeles outpost had sent to Hoover 
himself, advising that “the Los Angeles [Field] Office [of the FBI] is 
furnishing on a daily basis information to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s 
Office Intelligence Division and the Los Angeles Police Department 
Intelligence and Criminal Conspiracy Divisions concerning the activities of 
black nationalist groups in the anticipation that such information might lead 
to the arrest of the militants.” By the Church Committee’s estimation, this 
meant that Los Angeles law enforcement was guilty of obstructing justice and 
hindering prosecution. 


Manson the Race Warrior 


If there was a bridge between the Family and COINTELPRO, I thought it 
probably stemmed from this basic fact: Charles Manson was a racist. 
According to Gregg Jakobson, Manson sincerely believed that “the black 
man’s sole purpose on earth was to serve the white man.” Another member of 
the Family recalled that Manson looked forward to the day when, having 
survived the apocalyptic race war, he could “scratch blackie’s fuzzy head and 
kick him in the butt and tell him to go pick the cotton.” 

And at the start of ’°69, as COINTELPRO provoked black militants in 
L.A., Manson’s bigotry reached a delusional fever pitch. He became 
convinced, seemingly without a shred of evidence, that the Black Panthers 
were spying on the Family at the Spahn Ranch, planning an attack on him. 
His paranoia mounting, Manson placed armed guards at every entrance to the 
ranch, sending lookouts to the mountains with powerful telescopes. 

His fear was self-fulfilling, in a way. On July 1, 1969, during a dispute 
over drug money in a Hollywood apartment, Manson shot Bernard 
“Lotsapoppa” Crowe, a black drug dealer. According to Helter Skelter, the 
dealer had told Manson that he was a Panther, and that his “brothers” would 
“come and get” Manson at the ranch if he didn’t pay up. Manson shot Crowe 
in the chest and fled the scene, believing he’d killed the dealer. Back at the 
ranch, Manson was sure that Crowe’s friends were readying their attack. In 
Bugliosi’s account, this contributed to Manson’s decision a month later to 
“speed along the race war” by inciting “Helter Skelter”: the Tate-LaBianca 
murders would sow racial discord. 

But Bernard Crowe wasn’t a Black Panther. And he survived after 
Manson shot him—Bugliosi even called him to the stand during the trial. 
Bugliosi chalked it up to a misunderstanding on Manson’s part, but the more 
I thought about it, especially in light of what Pd learned about 
COINTELPRO, the more I wondered if there was more to the story. The 
prosecutor reported that Manson was already frightened of the Black 
Panthers before the Crowe shooting. If Manson were truly scared of the 
Panthers, the last thing he would have done is shoot a man whom he believed 
to be a Panther—a man who’d already told his “brothers” where Manson 
lived, and made a threat to kill him. True, Manson hoped to launch a race 
war, but he didn’t want to be caught in its crossfire. That was a fate he 


wished on other whites, but never on himself. 

Furthermore, Tex Watson’s girlfriend and three of Crowe’s friends had 
witnessed the shooting; they called an ambulance after Manson made his 
getaway. At the hospital, Crowe refused to tell the police who’d shot him. 
Wouldn’t the police have questioned the four witnesses? Did Crowe even say 
who they were? Why didn’t the police pursue a near fatal shooting with 
plenty of witnesses, especially when the alleged shooter was a paroled ex- 
con? We might never know—Bugliosi doesn’t clarify any of it in Helter 
Skelter. 

Pd always considered the Crowe shooting an inexplicable sideshow in the 
Manson circus. It took on grander proportions after I’d learned about the 
FBI’s disinformation campaign against the Panthers—at this same time, this 
same place. Less than a week after the Tate murders, further COINTELPRO 
provocations led to the shootings of three more Panthers, one of them fatal. 


The CIA on Domestic Soil 


In August 1967, the same month Hoover launched COINTELPRO, CIA 
director Richard Helms inaugurated the agency’s aforementioned illegal 
domestic surveillance program, CHAOS, which also employed agents and 
informants to infiltrate “subversive” groups and then “neutralize” them. 

CHAOS was born of Lyndon Johnson’s neurosis. In the summer of ’67, 
the president was convinced that the divided, disorderly America he led 
couldn’t possibly be the product of his own policies. Foreign agents, and 
presumably foreign money, must be to blame. He ordered the CIA to prove 
that the nation’s dissidents, and especially its antiwar movement, had their 
origins abroad. 

Richard Helms complied without hesitation. In the six years that followed, 
the CIA tracked thousands of Americans, insulating its information gathering 
so thoroughly that even those at the top of its counterintelligence division 
were clueless about its domestic surveillance. CHAOS kept tabs on three 
hundred thousand people, more than seven thousand of them American 
citizens. The agency shared information with the FBI, the White House, and 
the Justice Department. At its peak, CHAOS had fifty-two dedicated agents, 
most of whom served to infiltrate antiwar groups, like their counterparts in 


the FBI. Undercover, they hoped to identify Russian instigators, although 
they never found any. With the Interdivision Intelligence Unit (IDIU), a new 
branch of the Justice Department outfitted with sophisticated computerized 
databases, they collaborated on a list of more than ten thousand names, all 
thought to be dangerous activists; the IDIU produced regular reports on these 
people, hoping to predict their activities. 

The journalist Seymour Hersh got wind of CHAOS late in 1974. He told 
James Jesus Angleton, the head of CIA counterintelligence, and William 
Colby, the director of the CIA, that he had a story “bigger than My Lai” 
about CIA domestic activities. Colby was forced to admit that Hersh’s 
findings were accurate, and Angleton resigned from the agency. The story 
broke on December 22, on the front page of the New York Times: “Huge CIA 
Operation Reported in U.S. Against Anti-War Forces, Other Dissidents in 
Nixon Years.” 

The Church Committee probed the CIA’s illegal activities, as did a 
separate government investigation, the Rockefeller Commission—but neither 
was able to penetrate the agency’s veil of secrecy. Since the CIA has no right 
to operate on American soil, the program should have brought even more 
censure than COINTELPRO; instead, it drew only a muted response. CIA 
leadership stonewalled at every opportunity. Even if they hadn’t, 
investigators were crippled by the dearth of information. When Richard 
Helms had disbanded CHAOS before leaving office in 1973, he ordered the 
destruction of every file pertaining to it, and since the seventies, almost 
nothing has come out. The operation hardly left a footprint. 

Even if reams of paperwork had survived, the Rockefeller Commission 
was hardly willing to press the agency. While the commission made some 
shocking findings—evidence of wiretaps, bugging, and hidden burglaries, in 
addition to the extensive record keeping mentioned above—by the end of the 
seventies, well after it had disbanded, allegations arose that it had suppressed 
information. (Its chairman, Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, had worked 
with the CIA in the late fifties.) In a memoir, former CIA director Colby later 
claimed that President Gerald Ford fired him for refusing to help Rockefeller 
sabotage his own investigation. According to Colby, CHAOS was so highly 
classified that even he, the director of the CIA, didn’t have access to it. “I 
found it impossible to do much about whatever was wrong with [CHAOS],” 
he wrote. “Its super-secrecy and extreme compartmentalization kept me very 


much on its periphery.” 

In the spring of ’78, the New York Times revealed that the investigations 
into CHAOS had been woefully inadequate. When one agent was asked why 
he hadn’t been more forthcoming, he said simply, “They didn’t ask.” The true 
extent of the agency’s domestic activities against dissidents would probably 
never be known, the Times declared—but the paper had been able to uncover 
CHAOS activities from the late sixties that had targeted the Black Panther 
party. Rockefeller’s commission failed to reveal that “between 150 and 200 
CIA domestic files on Black dissidents had been destroyed,” the Times 
reported. “The CIA conducted at least two major programs involving the use 
of American blacks, when the Panthers, organized by young blacks in the 
mid-60s, were publicly advocating revolutionary change... Just how 
successful the CIA was in those alleged activities could not be determined.” 


Winning Hearts and Minds 


Knowing more about CHAOS and COINTELPRO, I felt that men like Reeve 
Whitson were potentially much more common than I’d anticipated, always in 
peripheral, undefined roles. Part of the reason that Whitson seemed like such 
a wild card to me was that he appeared to have walked on the scene from 
nowhere: an outré, worldly man suddenly hobnobbing with the LAPD’s top 
brass. I wanted others who fit that profile. To cover up an operation like 
CHAOS, the agency needed friends in law enforcement—insiders who could 
make arrests or, just as important, not make arrests. 

The most promising but frustrating of my inquiries concerned an LAPD 
officer named William W. Herrmann. I could never connect him to Whitson 
or Manson, but he certainly fit the profile of someone who’d helped with 
counterintelligence actions. When I was deep in the weeds of my CHAOS 
research, split between feeling that I was onto something or that I was risking 
my credibility, Herrmann’s was a name that came up several times—usually 
from sources I didn’t quite trust, or in arcane articles from the alternative 
press. What I heard about him was just plausible enough to get me to look 
closer. I’m glad I did. Herrmann’s story hints at how intelligence agencies 
may have collaborated with police in Los Angeles. 

A longtime lieutenant with the LAPD, Herrmann had an unusual 


background for law enforcement. He had a doctorate in psychology; he 
specialized in quelling insurgencies; he’d developed one of the first computer 
systems to track criminals and predict violent outbreaks in cities. Daryl 
Gates, the head of the LAPD from 1978 to 1992, hailed him as a “genius,” 
praising his technical aptitude in particular. 

But Herrmann’s work wasn’t limited to Los Angeles, or even to the 
United States. My FOIA request to the FBI yielded a collection of redacted 
documents detailing his extensive employment history. Concurrent with his 
time in the LAPD, he’d worked under contract for a dizzying list of American 
intelligence and military agencies: the air force, the Secret Service, the 
Treasury Department, the President’s Office of Science and Technology, the 
Institute for Defense Analysis, the Defense Industrial Security Clearance 
Office, and the Defense Department’s Advanced Research Projects Agency. 
Most of his work for these groups remains classified. 

You’d think these projects wouldn’t have left much free time, but 
Herrmann piled on even more work, taking leaves of absence from the LAPD 
to pursue side gigs with defense firms. These had opaque, generic names like 
Electro-Dash Optical Systems, System Development Corp., and Control Data 
Corp. This last, a weapons manufacturer in Minneapolis, relied on 
Herrmann’s services for ten years, from 1961 to ’71—or so Herrmann told 
the FBI. When the Bureau went to Control Data Corp. for a background 
check, the company claimed that Herrmann never worked for them. 

You might have guessed: given Herrmann’s long list of government 
employers, I wondered if his work for these defense contractors could have 
been a front for the CIA, one of the few agencies that didn’t appear on his 
résumé. As usual, official channels were useless. My FOIA request to the 
CIA for Herrmann’s records yielded the same “neither confirm or deny” 
response that Reeve Whitson’s had. 

I did find, however, a record of Herrmann’s overseas work, much of 
which he conducted while still employed with the LAPD. Having spent four 
months in 1967 training Thai police in counterinsurgency tactics, Herrmann 
returned to Asia in September 1968 to join the U.S. effort in South Vietnam. 
Documents from the National Archives in College Park, Maryland, listed him 
as a scientific “advisor” to the army. His responsibility was to train South 
Vietnamese police in “paramilitary techniques” to deploy against Viet Cong 
insurgents. None of the records described those techniques in any detail, but 


the mere mention of them was enough to make me put a few things together. 
The dates of Herrmann’s stint in Vietnam, his job description, his 
professional affiliations, and his training made it abundantly likely that he 
was working for a CIA project called Phoenix, one of the most controversial 
elements in the agency’s history. 

[[Richard Nixon]] had secretly authorized Phoenix in 1968; it was 
discontinued in early ’71. The agency described it as “a set of programs that 
sought to attack and destroy the political infrastructure of the Viet Cong.” 
Inside Vietnam, Phoenix operatives waged a campaign of terror against the 
Viet Cong guerrillas, with tactics including the assassination and torture of 
noncombatant civilians. According to a 1971 congressional investigation, the 
program violated the codes of the Geneva Conventions and rivaled the Viet 
Cong’s own terrorism in its mercilessness. 

During the Senate hearings, a number of Phoenix operatives admitted to 
massacring civilians and making it appear that the atrocities were the work of 
the Viet Cong. Their hope was to “win the hearts and minds” of neutral 
Vietnamese citizens, compelling them to turn away from the insurgency in 
revulsion. A Special Forces soldier, Anthony Herbert, the single most 
decorated combat veteran of Vietnam, published a bestselling book, Soldier, 
that detailed typical orders from his Phoenix superiors: “They wanted me to 
take charge of execution teams that wiped out entire families and tried to 
make it appear as though the Viet Cong had done it themselves. The rationale 
was that the Viet Cong would see that other Viet Cong had killed their own 
and... make allegiance with us. The good guys.” 

Their attempts were sometimes even more unhinged. In 1968, CIA 
scientists at the Bien Hoa Prison outside Saigon surgically opened the skulls 
of three prisoners, implanted electrodes on their brains, gave them daggers, 
and left them alone in a room. They wanted to shock the prisoners into killing 
one another. When the effort failed, the prisoners were shot and their bodies 
burned. 

According to Seymour Hersh’s 1972 book, Cover-Up, Phoenix had 
“committees” set up across all forty-four provinces in South Vietnam. They 
kept blacklists of Viet Cong fighters and had strict orders to meet weekly or 
monthly quotas of “neutralizations.” The whole operation relied on 
computerized indexes. The identity of its CIA leader never came to light— 
but whoever he was, he was there ostensibly as part of the Agency for 


International Development (AID), later revealed as a CIA front. 

Herrmann, of course, was known for his aptitude with computers, and his 
time in Vietnam coincided almost exactly with Phoenix’s operations. The 
papers I found at the National Archives confirmed that he was a part of AID. 

I had no way to press him about any of this; he’d died in 1993. As I had 
with Whitson, I wondered whether his family could tell me more about him. I 
found one of his daughters, Cindy, a dog breeder in Spokane, Washington; 
she invited me to see her. Only a teenager in the sixties, she didn’t have many 
memories of her father’s work, but she was confident that much of it had 
been top-secret, and that he’d worked for the CIA. He never discussed his 
work with the family, not even her mother; she was instructed never to talk 
about her father with anyone, including extended family. She knew he did 
undercover work, both while he was with the LAPD and afterward. She 
showed me his passport. Visa stamps chronicled at least four trips to Vietnam 
between 1968 and ’70. Among his ID cards was one for “The Xuat Nhap 
Vietnam Cong HOA.” 

She also shared several documents confirming Herrmann’s participation 
in Phoenix. A framed memo from the U.S. Military Assistance Command, 
Vietnam, dated September 9, 1968, advised all personnel that Herrmann was 
a “member of the Pacification Task Force working for Ambassador Komer.” 
Komer, first name Robert, was nicknamed “Blowtorch Bob” for his take-no- 
prisoners approach to warfare. He served fifteen years in the CIA before 
arriving in Vietnam to work on Phoenix; according to Senate testimony, he 
was behind the program’s notorious kill quotas. Even Herrmann’s ephemera 
captivated me. Cindy had held on to a photo of dozens of men on an airplane, 
captioned, “‘Bad guys’ leaving a bad spot after having been bad.” 


Once he returned from Vietnam, Herrmann retired from the LAPD after more 
than twenty years on the force, embarking on a series of “research” gigs for 
various federal agencies—again, all top-secret. With information from Cindy, 
a growing pile of press clippings, and the government documents I’d 
amassed, I tried to piece together Herrmann’s postretirement projects. 
Whatever he’d learned in Southeast Asia, he brought it back to L.A.—his 
work in California bore disturbing resemblances to the techniques he’d honed 
as part of the Phoenix project. In 1968, Governor Reagan appointed him to 


head a new Riots and Disorders Task Force, dedicated to studying urban 
unrest and devising ways to prevent future outbreaks of violence. But in a 
1970 interview, Herrmann revealed, maybe by accident, that the task force 
was hardly the research-based enterprise it claimed to be. 

Herrmann didn’t give many interviews, but when he spoke to the London 
Observer’s Charles Foley in May 1970, he was apparently in a voluble mood. 
Discussing his work for the task force, he described a program of spying and 
infiltration far exceeding the “studies” that the group was committed to—his 
words sounded as if they’d been lifted from COINTELPRO and CHAOS 
manuals. (Both of those operations, of course, were well under way in Los 
Angeles.) 

Like Governor Reagan and President Johnson, Herrmann believed that 
California’s student dissidents were funded by foreign Communists. He told 
the Observer that he had a “secret plan” for “forestalling revolution in 
America.” The key was “to split off those bent on destroying the system from 
the mass of dissenters; then following classic guerilla warfare ‘theory’ to find 
means which will win their hearts and minds.” He called this plan, simply, 
“Saving America,” and it included strategies for “deeper penetration by 
undercover agents into dissenting groups,” such as “army agents pos[ing] as 
students and news reporters.” In a turn worthy of Minority Report, he wanted 
to use mathematical probability models to predict when and where violence 
would erupt. He also called for the use of long-range electronic surveillance 
devices; if informants had already penetrated any “dissenting groups,” they 
would “secretly record speeches and conversations.” 

What that information would be used for, and how, Herrmann didn’t say. 
He spoke of the task force in the future tense, making it hard to discern how 
operational its “Saving America” tactics were. Whatever the case, his brazen 
claims generated backlash from the left. His daughter showed me a flyer from 
the Students for a Democratic Society depicting him as a pig. Maybe he felt 
he’d said too much—or maybe his superiors told him so—but a few months 
later, he gave another, more circumspect interview. Talking this time to the 
Sacramento Bee, he walked back some of his more chilling claims about 
“Saving America.” “Herrmann bridles at an article in the London Observer,” 
the reporter wrote, quoting Herrmann: “The council could not set up a plan 
like that... We have a nonoperational role. All we can do is review and fund 
projects suggested by local authorities.” 


“Saving America” sounded a lot like COINTELPRO, which sounded a lot 
like CHAOS—they all ran together, in part, it seemed, because they’d all 
shared notes. In June 2002, the San Francisco Chronicle published an 
investigative series detailing Governor Reagan’s secret dealings with the CIA 
and the FBI, all part of his effort to halt what he construed as a Communist- 
sponsored antiwar movement in California. The Chronicle revealed an 
internal FBI memo from July 1969, when Herbert Ellinwood, one of the 
governor’s top advisors, visited FBI headquarters to discuss Reagan’s plans 
for the “destruction of disruptive elements on California campuses.” As the 
Chronicle reported, “Ellinwood asked the FBI for ‘intelligence’ information 
against protest groups... the FBI had secretly given the Reagan 
administration such assistance in the past.” 

[[J Edgar Hoover]] himself approved the request. The FBI suggested that the 
California state government might attack dissidents through “a psychological 
warfare campaign.” If that’s what Reagan wanted, he didn’t have to look far. 
In his own circle of advisors was Herrmann, the chairman of the Riots and 
Disorders Task Force, a veteran of Phoenix, and a man whose antileftist ideas 
jibed perfectly with the Reagan’s administration in Sacramento, to say 
nothing of the FBI’s and the CIA’s. 


In 1978, a congressional committee uncovered evidence that the CIA had 
“operatives” in at least one city’s district attorney’s office in the late sixties. I 
wondered if a similar situation existed in Los Angeles and, if so, who those 
operatives might have been. 

It wouldn’t have been too difficult an agency to penetrate. At the time of 
the Manson murders, in 1969, the district attorney of Los Angeles was Evelle 
Younger, whose résumé linked him to tons of intelligence work. Decades 
earlier, he’d been “one of the top agents” of Hoover’s FBI. In 1942, he left 
the Bureau to join the Office of Strategic Services. Trained in espionage and 
counterintelligence techniques, he opted to enroll in law school after the war. 

In the fifties, Younger was elected to the bench before becoming Los 
Angeles district attorney in 1964. A staunch Republican and a friend of 
Governor Reagan, he was appointed head of a federal law-and-order task 
force in January 1969, organized by incoming president Richard Nixon to 
crack down on crime and internal threats to the nation’s security. According 


to the 1974 book Big Brother and the Holding Company: The World Behind 
Watergate, the “politically ambitious” Younger advised Nixon to “appoint 
tougher judges, use more wiretaps, encourage ‘space age techniques and 
hardware,’ and support local police with better training and equipment.” 

Younger’s subordinates in the DA’s office referred to him as “the 
General.” In his obituary, the Los Angeles Times in 1989 noted that he was 
“the first prosecutor in America to undertake mass felony prosecutions of 
college campus demonstrators in the 1960s”; he’d prosecuted students who’d 
protested the absence of a black studies program at San Fernando Valley 
State College. The November 1969 trial resulted in twenty convictions, a 
coup for the up-and-coming deputy DA who tried the case: Vincent Bugliosi. 

If the CIA wanted a presence in the Los Angeles DA’s office, Younger 
didn’t strike me as someone who’d put his foot down. Nor did his second in 
command, Lynn “Buck” Compton, who’d been an LAPD detective before 
getting his law degree and joining the DA’s office. Compton was the lead 
prosecutor in the trial of Sirhan B. Sirhan for the assassination of Senator 
Robert F. Kennedy. And he’d been a World War II hero—his exploits with 
the parachute infantry regiment, the Easy Company, were chronicled in the 
HBO miniseries Band of Brothers. 

I found a letter that Compton wrote to Herrmann on March 14, 1969, five 
months before the Tate—LaBianca murders, thanking him for “obtaining good 
advance intelligence... on subversives and militants.” The two had served 
together on the LAPD in the fifties, so I wasn’t surprised that they knew each 
other. I was surprised that Compton had written a note that all but proved that 
he and Herrmann were operating beyond their remit for the State of 
California. Neither man had any business gathering “advance intelligence” on 
“subversives and militants’—or on anyone else, for that matter. The DA’s 
office was supposed to prosecute crimes, not prevent them. And Herrmann, 
in his strenuous correction to the London Observer article, had stressed that 
his role was “nonoperational.” 


Coda: Front-Page News 


I read about CHAOS and COINTELPRO until I must’ve sounded, to all my 
friends, like a tinfoil-hat-wearing conspiracy theorist, someone who might go 


off on a long-winded tangent about the threats of the deep state. But the fact 
that the CIA has become an all-purpose scapegoat—the preeminent symbol 
of global power run amok—doesn’t change the fact that its abuses of power 
in the 1960s were legitimate and myriad. If anything, these abuses were so 
gross that they’ve lent authority to any and every claim against federal 
intelligence agencies: if the CIA and the FBI are capable of killing American 
citizens in cold blood, often in elaborate schemes, what aren’t they capable 
of? 

There had been a day in the summer of ’69 when the major elements from 
my reporting collided on a single page of the Los Angeles Times. An August 
12 article about the DA’s argument in the UCLA Panther murder trial 
(“Panther Killings Result of Power Play, Jury Told”) ran next to a piece on 
the LAPD’s theory that the LaBianca killers were imitating the people who’d 
murdered the Tate victims the night before (“Police See ‘Copycat Killer’ in 
Slaying of Los Feliz Couple”). The irony was that both of these stories were 
wrong. The LaBianca murders weren’t the work of a “copycat killer,” and the 
police should’ve known by then; the real “power play” at UCLA was 
perpetrated by the FBI. I was tantalized by the juxtaposition of the two items: 
by how much of the “news” in them was flawed when it was first reported, 
and by how much of it might be flawed still. 

Manson’s race-war motive dovetailed almost too perfectly with the goals 
of these federal agencies and the DA’s office. In programs like CHAOS and 
COINTELPRO—and in people like Reeve Whitson, William Herrmann, and 
Buck Compton—I saw the potential for a major turn in my reporting, even as 
I tried to accept that so much of what they did would always be untraceable. 

Still, if nefarious plots from the CIA and FBI had eventually exploded 
into public view, I thought I should at least try to see where my hunches led 
me. What I wanted to answer was this: How did a body like the Los Angeles 
DA’s office exert its political force? If it wanted to be of service to a higher 
agency, like the FBI or the CIA, would that be easily accomplished, or was I 
veering too much into the realm of the paranoiac? 

I didn’t have to look very far to see how the DA’s office wielded its 
power. One glaring example came at the start of the Manson trial, when, 
without anyone being the wiser, the DA’s office conspired to make sure that 
its narrative for the Tate-—LaBianca murders was the only one that anyone 
ever heard.

The Lawyer Swap 


“My Hands Were Tied” 


When it came to prosecuting the Manson Family, the Los Angeles DA’s 
office left nothing to chance. I’d already seen that Vincent Bugliosi had no 
problem getting his witnesses to lie on the stand, and that Deputy DA Buck 
Compton gathered intelligence on “subversives and militants.” What I found 
next was evidence of more pervasive, top-down interference by the DA’s 
office, which took extraordinary measures to control, and likely in part to 
fabricate, the story of the Manson murders. 

The first signs of misconduct came during the trial of Bobby Beausoleil. 
He was accused of murdering Gary Hinman, the musician who’d been found 
stabbed to death just days before the Tate-—LaBianca murders. 

For reasons never disclosed by Bugliosi, the DA’s office tried Beausoleil 
separately from the rest of the Family. As I suggested earlier, it made sense to 
try all three of the murder cases together—Hinman, Tate, and LaBianca. Law 
enforcement had connected the crimes. Uniting them under a single trial 
would’ve made it easier to convict Manson of conspiracy, since he’d helped 
torture Hinman and had ordered all three sets of slaughters. 

And yet they kept the cases separate. I thought I knew why. If they’d 
thrown Hinman in with Tate—LaBianca, the resulting testimony would have 
revealed that the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office (LASO) knew as early 
as August 10 that the Manson Family was responsible for all the murders. 
Remember, LASO detectives Charlie Guenther and Paul Whiteley broke the 
Tate case when a recorded phone call from one of Hinman’s murderers, 


Beausoleil, clued them in to a link with the Tate murders. The only way to 
hide this early break was to try the Hinman murder case separately. 

Beausoleil went to trial on November 12, 1969. The prosecutor was 
Ronald Ross, the deputy DA in Santa Monica, who confirmed to me that the 
case had been tried separately under very suspicious circumstances. He had 
orders, he said, to keep Charles Manson and the Family out of the trial. That 
meant that scoring a conviction against Beausoleil would be an uphill battle 
—since, after all, without Manson’s instructions, he may never have 
murdered Hinman. 

Still, Ross felt he had no choice but to obey. “My hands were tied,” he 
told me. When we first spoke, in 2000, he’d recently retired after thirty years 
in the DA’s office, and the case sounded fresh in his mind. He remembered 
“the orders from on high: don’t mention the name of Manson or these other 
people.” 

Ross later learned that his superiors at the DA’s office, and his own 
investigating detectives, Guenther and Whiteley, had withheld all evidence 
related to the Manson Family from him to keep their secret. “I was pissed 
when I learned later that they had other evidence,” Ross said. “I [was] closed 
out of the thing. I really don’t know why they did that.” 

He could still recall the day the case first landed on his desk, in early 
September 1969. He was just back from a vacation. The horrors of the Tate— 
LaBianca murders, then only a month old, still dominated the news. The 
killers remained at large, and no one even knew who they were. Ross was 
struck by reports that they’d left the bloody word “Pig” in conspicuous areas 
of both the Tate and LaBianca homes. His Hinman murder scene featured 
such writing, too. He took one look at the case and immediately connected it 
to the unsolved Tate—LaBianca murders. “You’d have to be deaf, dumb, and 
blind not to,” he said. 

He called in Guenther and Whiteley to ask them about it. “And they said, 
‘Oh, no, no, it’s not related. No, [we] can’t find any connection between the 
two.” He still sounded bruised when he added, “Now I think they were lying 
through their teeth.” 

Guenther denied the allegation to me, but I found it believable, given what 
he’d told me about his investigation. And if it’s true, it shows that by 
September 1969, he and Whiteley were conspiring to hide what they’d 
learned about the Manson Family’s role in the murders. 


Since Ross wasn’t allowed to link Beausoleil to the Family, his case was 
mostly circumstantial and, by his own admission, weak. After just two days 
of testimony, the trial was more or less wrapped up. Beausoleil’s defense 
attorney, Leon Salter, didn’t call a single witness. When the defense rested, 
Ross’s superiors feared they might lose the trial; they needed more evidence. 
At the last minute, they decided to take a gamble. 

Just before the attorneys delivered their closing arguments, David Fitts— 
the head deputy DA of Santa Monica, and Ross’s supervisor—went into a 
closed meeting with the judge, who emerged ten minutes later to announce 
that the trial would be delayed for five days to accommodate a new witness 
for the prosecution: Danny DeCarlo, the Straight Satans bike-gang member 
who’d moved to the Spahn Ranch that spring of 1969. 

The judge’s action here was unprecedented, or close to it. For one thing, 
the two lawyers who’d just rested their cases, Ross and Salter, had no say in 
it. Plus, as a matter of course, trials are almost never reopened after the 
defense has rested; it risks prejudicing the jury. 

When I reached Salter on the phone, he was still incensed by the choice. 
“For the judge to discuss the case without the opposing attorney being 
present is just unheard of,” he told me. “There was just something rotten 
about it... I never reported it to [the] state bar, which I’ll always regret.” In 
the trial transcript, Salter made his objections plain. “It is shocking,” he told 
the judge, “that when you are in the middle of a trial, where this young man 
can end up with a life imprisonment, that the District Attorney... has the 
audacity to talk about this case without my being present.” 

You might think that Ross wouldn’t have minded the intervention so 
much—Fitts was his boss, after all, and they were both angling for 
Beausoleil’s conviction. But Ross bristled at having been excluded, too. In 
his thirty years as a DA, he told me, he’d never been left out of a meeting 
about his own witness lineup. 

Ross felt he had no choice but to put DeCarlo on the stand. “That was the 
first time in my whole career where I was actually ordered to use a witness,” 
Ross said. The decision came from the highest levels of the DA’s office. Fitts 
was taking orders from someone. “My best estimate,” Ross said, “would be 
Buck Compton.” 

Ross thought DeCarlo lacked credibility. The biker, already a convicted 
felon, had decided to testify only because he was facing new charges for 


marijuana possession and having stolen a motorcycle engine. He was, to use 
Ross’s word, a snitch, and it was impossible to say if he was telling the truth 
or not. “DeCarlo was simply amoral,” Ross said. “He could have said 
whatever he wanted to say.” And getting something useful out of DeCarlo on 
the stand would be no mean feat, because Ross still wasn’t allowed to 
introduce anything about Manson or the Family, even though his new witness 
was a known associate of theirs. 

Once he was sworn in, DeCarlo relayed the story of the Hinman stabbing. 
He claimed he was telling it exactly as he’d heard it from Beausoleil himself. 
He even included the parts where a man named Charlie, who lived at the 
Spahn Ranch, cut Hinman’s ear off with “a long sword,” and later ordered 
Beausoleil to kill Hinman, telling him, “You know what to do.” But he never 
gave Charlie’s full name. 

Then came Salter’s cross-examination. 

“This person Charlie that you referred to in your testimony,” he said to 
DeCarlo. “Were you aware of this person Charlie’s full name?” 

“Charles Manson,” DeCarlo said. It was the first time the name had been 
uttered in the whole trial—on the last day of testimony. 

That was November 24. Outside the courtroom, police and district 
attorneys were finally making headway on the Tate—LaBianca crimes. Like 
Ross, Salter knew enough to suspect a link. The prosecution’s sudden 
addition of DeCarlo only encouraged those suspicions. Salter knew that 
police had questioned DeCarlo about the Tate murders, and he intended to let 
the jury know it, too. 

Manuel Gutierrez, an LAPD officer who’d been the first to hear 
DeCarlo’s story, took the stand to lend the biker some credibility. Salter tried 
to get the information out of him. “Sir,” he asked, “you were investigating the 
Tate murder case at that time, were you not?” 

Ross objected; the court sustained. 

“Your Honor, may I be heard on this?” Salter said. At the bench, out of 
earshot from the jury, Salter argued that the jurors should know that DeCarlo 
was connected to the unsolved Tate murders. “I think we can prove 
[Gutierrez] was interviewing [DeCarlo] with regard to the Tate murder case,” 
he said. “If it was a small case, fine, but he is investigating a case in which 
there has been so much publicity, and they are rather anxious, I imagine, to 
find out who did it.” 


But the judge allowed no further questions on the topic, and that was the 
last anyone heard of a potential connection to the Tate murders. 

Ironically, the addition of DeCarlo did nothing to help the prosecution. 
The jurors didn’t trust him any more than Ross did. The trial ended in a hung 
jury. Thanks to Ross’s candor, it is clear that the lack of evidence could be 
blamed squarely on the higher-ups in the DA’s office: they needed to cover 
up Guenther and Whiteley’s early knowledge of the Manson Family as the 
Tate—LaBianca murderers. 


“Warm and Sticky and Nice” 


As they tailored the Hinman trial to suit the needs of the state, Buck Compton 
and Vincent Bugliosi were also behind the scenes of the Tate—LaBianca case. 
The DA’s office knew it needed a momentous conviction, a sense of justice 
befitting the crime of the century. And Bugliosi, who aspired to power and 
celebrity, saw how much he could gain from some good publicity here. His 
office needed to control the narrative from the start, whether they had the 
evidence to back it up or not. 

Even in clear-cut circumstances, a criminal trial is a messy, protracted 
affair—and once the verdict comes in, all the particularities fade from the 
public mind. In the fifty years since Manson and his followers were 
convicted, the details have become largely irrelevant. If people recall any 
aspect of the trial, it’s usually the testimony of Linda Kasabian, the state’s 
Star witness. She’d served as a lookout and a driver for the Family during 
both nights of murders. Granted immunity, Kasabian was able to describe the 
crimes and the inner workings of the Family in nauseating detail, clinching 
the case against Manson. And while many observers weren’t pleased that an 
accomplice to the murders would walk free, Kasabian took pains to appear 
more honorable than the others. She showed remorse; she emphasized that 
she hadn’t participated in any of the violence. 

What hardly anyone remembers is that Kasabian wasn’t the first one in 
the Family to get a deal from the prosecutors. Before her was Susan Atkins, 
the woman who’d led the police to break the case—and who was eventually 
convicted along with the other killers, spending the rest of her life in prison 
before her death in 2009. Before Kasabian flipped, Atkins, an unrepentant 


killer, was the foundation for the LAPD’s case, and for the prosecution that 
followed. 

To pursue the conviction of Manson, the prosecution first had to bring 
their charges before a grand jury. They relied strongly on Atkins’s testimony 
there—it was instrumental in securing the first-degree murder indictments 
against Manson and five others, including herself. In short, it was her story 
that made Bugliosi’s famous trial possible. 

But I found two memos indicating that Atkins was improperly obtained as 
a witness. Before she or any other Manson followers had been charged, 
prosecutors colluded with a Superior Court judge to have her legally 
appointed defense attorney replaced by a former deputy DA who would do 
their bidding. Her story, sanctioned and tweaked by the DA’s office and her 
planted defense attorney, was based on lies. The entire narrative put before 
that grand jury should be reconsidered. 


It started with the end of the Family. About a month after the Tate—LaBianca 
murders that would bring them to infamy, they fled the Spahn Ranch; 
Manson believed the police were closing in on them. (He also feared 
retaliation from the Black Panthers, having mistakenly believed, as discussed 
in the last chapter, that he’d murdered one—Bernard Crowe, who was neither 
a Panther nor dead.) He resettled his clan deep in Death Valley, at an 
adjoining pair of remote, barren ranches called Myers and Barker. There they 
sustained themselves through petty crimes and an auto-theft ring. It was this 
last that brought them to the attention of Inyo County law enforcement, who 
tracked them to their compound and captured them in raids over two nights in 
mid-October 1969. 

In Independence, California, the group of twenty-some bedraggled hippies 
sat in the cramped county jail. LASO detectives Guenther and Whiteley 
drove 225 miles to the dusty desert town to seek out a possible witness in the 
Hinman murder. You may remember her name: Kitty Lutesinger, Bobby 
Beausoleil’s girlfriend, the same witness the detectives had seemingly 
deliberately failed to track down months earlier. 

Lutesinger’s parents had called the detectives to say that their daughter 
was in custody in Independence. When Guenther and Whiteley found her, she 
told them that Susan Atkins had boasted of torturing and finally killing 


Hinman with Beausoleil over two nights. The story aligned with what they’d 
already heard. They asked the Inyo County sheriff to take them to Atkins 
herself. 

Atkins agreed to speak to the detectives without an attorney present. They 
told her that her fingerprints had been found at the Hinman crime scene and 
that Beausoleil had already ratted on her—both lies, but they got her talking 
about the crime. Atkins admitted to having held Hinman while Beausoleil 
stabbed him, but she claimed she never hurt him. She was booked on a first- 
degree-murder charge and transferred to the Sybil Brand Institute for 
Women, in downtown Los Angeles. 

Atkins’s cellmate was a longtime con artist and call girl who went by 
Ronnie Howard. The two became fast friends. Almost immediately, Atkins 
was telling Howard and another inmate, Virginia Graham, all about her role 
in the Tate-LaBianca murders. She had personally stabbed Sharon Tate to 
death, she bragged, as Tate begged for the life of her unborn baby. After Tate 
died, Atkins said she’d tasted the dead actress’s blood; it was “warm and 
sticky and nice.” 

Howard was shocked. Here was a woman casually crowing about the 
biggest unsolved murder in Los Angeles history. On November 17, she made 
a hushed call from a pay phone to the Hollywood station of the LAPD, telling 
a detective that she knew who was responsible for the Tate—LaBianca 
murders. 

That night, the LAPD sent two detectives to interview Howard at Sybil 
Brand. She convinced them easily of the veracity of her claims. Fearing for 
her safety, detectives had her moved to an isolated unit. The next morning, 
more detectives interviewed her, and that same day they brought their 
information to the district attorney, Evelle Younger. He assigned Aaron 
Stovitz and Vincent Bugliosi to prosecute the case. The Tate—LaBianca 
murders had been solved. 


“Strong Client Control” 


On the evening of November 19, Bugliosi attended a hastily convened 
meeting at the district attorney’s office. In attendance were his immediate 
superior, Assistant District Attorney Joseph Busch; Aaron Stovitz, also from 


the DA’s office; and, from the LAPD, Lieutenant Paul LePage and Sergeant 
Mike McGann, of the LaBianca and Tate investigative teams, respectively. 

With the consent of the DA’s office, the LAPD wanted to cut a deal with 
Susan Atkins: she’d share what she knew about the murders in exchange for 
immunity. Bugliosi thought this was a grave error. Atkins, he reminded his 
colleagues, had described personally stabbing Sharon Tate to death and 
tasting her blood. She’d admitted stabbing other victims at the Tate house. 
She’d participated in the murder of Gary Hinman. And that was only what 
they’d heard so far—who knows what else she’d done? “We don’t give that 
gal anything!” he claimed to have said. 

But the LAPD was adamant. For months, they’d been under enormous 
pressure to solve the case. The press had derided them constantly for their 
failure. Now they could announce their success with a splashy press 
conference and rush the case to a grand jury. Bugliosi countered that they 
were getting ahead of themselves. They didn’t have a case yet, only a solid 
lead. 

The group reached a compromise: instead of total immunity, Atkins 
would be offered a second-degree-murder plea, sparing her the death penalty 
while ensuring she wouldn’t walk free. But, as Bugliosi acknowledged in 
Helter Skelter, they didn’t work out “the precise terms” of this offer. One of 
the most pressing concerns went unaddressed: Would Atkins have to testify 
at the trial—before the public, and Manson himself—or only for the grand 
jury? 

However Bugliosi claimed to have felt about Atkins, the district attorney’s 
office was desperate to secure her cooperation; without it, they weren’t sure 
they could indict Manson and the other killers. A lot depended on her 
reliability and consistency. What if she changed her story, which, so far, 
they’d only heard from her cellmate? And even more was riding on her 
defense attorney—if he didn’t like the deal, he could prove to be a major 
obstacle. Rather than risk that, the DA’s office decided they’d do better to 
replace him with someone guaranteed to play by their rules—and someone 
who could make sure Atkins said the right thing at the right time. 

Atkins’s attorney was Gerald Condon, a lawyer in private practice who’d 
been legally appointed by a judge to represent her in the Hinman murder. 
Normally, the court would’ve assigned her someone from the public 
defender’s office, but they couldn’t do that here—Beausoleil, her accomplice 


in the Hinman killing, was already represented by a public defender, and in 
such cases the court had to avoid a potential conflict of interest. So Condon it 
was. 

Condon was appointed on November 12. Two weeks later, on November 
26, he was out. 

What happened? In the LASO archives, I found a seven-page memo that 
gave me a good lead. In an entry for November 20—the day after the DA’s 
office and the LAPD had agreed to attempt a deal with Atkins—the 
document notes a never-before-reported meeting between LASO officers, the 
LAPD, and “Mr. Compton and Mr. Stovitz of the DA’s office.” The men 
discussed the fact that “the Atkins woman would be in court on 11-26-69 for 
the Superior Court arraignment, at which time it was stated that there would 
be a change of her counsel and Mr. Caballero would be designated as her 
counsel” (emphasis added). There’s no mention of Condon’s or Atkins’s 
consent to this change. And it was presented as a fait accompli. This meeting 
came six days before the hearing in question—and yet all parties involved 
were already certain of the outcome. How? 

A second, less ambiguous document turned up in the files of LAPD 
lieutenant Paul LePage. It was a three-page summary of his investigative 
work on the LaBianca murders. A section on Susan Atkins’s court 
appearances described the same November 20 meeting in more detail: “It was 
decided that because of the gravity of the case and the importance of Atkins’s 
information and cooperation, that her attorney be the type who had ‘strong 
client control.’ Deputy District Attorney Fitts made several inquiries and it 
was decided that Condon might not have the necessary control.” 

So, behind Atkins’s and Condon’s backs, Fitts “recommended Dick 
Caballero as an attorney who had good client control and would properly 
represent his client.” Fitts got in touch with Judge Mario Clinco, who was 
overseeing the case, “and arrangements were made for Caballero to be 
appointed as Atkins’s attorney of record at her felony arraignment. This was 
accomplished.” 

“This was accomplished”—yes, it was, with no small contribution from 
Fitts, the same DA who'd inserted himself in the Beausoleil trial. 

According to the minutes of Atkins’s November 26 arraignment, the judge 
assigned Caballero to the case right then and there. No mention was made of 
Condon’s removal—or how or why it occurred. The full transcript of the 


hearing has vanished from the archives of the Los Angeles Superior Court. 
The court’s spokesperson told me that a thorough search of the archive 
produced no results. 

I called Condon to ask him about his removal from the case. He 
confirmed that he’d been replaced against his wishes—and his client’s—and 
that Judge Clinco had never given him a reason. 

“Whatever was going through Clinco’s mind, I don’t know,” Condon told 
me. “Atkins did ask that I stay on.” He remembered being “temporarily 
distressed” by Clinco’s action, but he never complained to the court about it. 
Once the news came that Atkins was involved in the Tate—LaBianca murders, 
his wife told him she’d leave him if he tried to represent her again. 

That was that. The LAPD and the district attorney’s office had quietly 
decided that their star witness needed a certain lawyer. Whether she or her 
attorney wanted it or not, they “accomplished” it. 


“Improper and Unethical” 


In addition to his much vaunted “client control,” the replacement lawyer, 
Richard Caballero, had another quality that endeared him to the DA’s office: 
he’d worked there himself for eight years. As a prosecutor, Caballero had 
won five death-penalty convictions, and he was still close with his former 
colleagues. Bugliosi, Compton, and the others could trust him. Now all he 
had to do was get Atkins to take the deal. She didn’t have to stay under his 
thumb forever, just long enough to make it through the grand jury and bring 
on the indictments they needed. 

We’ll never know exactly what Caballero promised Atkins, or how he laid 
out the terms of the deal: unlike most agreements of this nature, hers was 
never formalized in writing, never marked by her signature. Whatever he 
said, it was enough to satisfy the higher-ups at the LAPD and the DA’s 
office. On December 1, they were finally ready to tell the public: they’d 
solved the case of the century. 

That was the day Police Chief Edward Davis got his big press conference: 
sturdy podium, cameras rolling, hundreds of stunned and eager reporters 
jostling for space. Reading from prepared remarks, Davis doled out the 
details sparingly. He didn’t even provide Manson’s name, announcing that 


“legal restrictions prohibit the revelation of further information at this time.” 
Pressed for more information about the suspects, he said only that they were 
part of a “roving band of hippies” that called itself “The Family” and were 
led by a man they called “Jesus.” 

Davis had to be judicious, or at least appear to be. A thorough account of 
the murders could taint the jury pool. The next day, however, an endless 
trough of specifics came flooding out, provided by two unassailable, on-the- 
record sources: Atkins’s new attorney, Richard Caballero, and his law 
partner, Paul Caruso. 

Acting as no less than a bullhorn for the DA’s office, Caballero and 
Caruso—the latter a well-known mob lawyer and a longtime friend of Los 
Angeles DA Evelle Younger—outlined what would become, in essence, the 
prosecution’s case for murder against the Manson Family. 

Standing on the steps of the Santa Monica Courthouse, Caballero told 
gathered reporters that Atkins was a follower of Charles Manson, and that 
she’d been “at the scene of the Tate slayings, the Hinman murder, and the 
killings of the LaBiancas.” Atkins was under Manson’s “hypnotic spell,” but 
she had “nothing to do with the murders”—seemingly his only effort at 
exonerating her amid the onslaught of grim particulars. He added that 
Manson called himself “both God and the Devil,” and that the police had told 
him “that Atkins and the others were directed by Manson to go to both the 
Hinman house and the Tate house.” Atkins would “tell her complete story” to 
the grand jury later that week. 

In Helter Skelter, Bugliosi claimed that he’d come across Caballero’s 
comments in the evening paper, and that was the only way his office learned 
that Atkins had accepted their deal. He never even tried to explain why it 
wasn’t in writing or why Caballero wouldn’t have alerted him more formally. 

Over the next few days, Caballero and Caruso kept talking to the press— 
and talking, and talking. In case there was lingering ambiguity, they 
described Manson’s dictatorial methods. They offered a timeline of events for 
the nights of the murders, including the order of the deaths. They tossed in 
sordid details, describing the killers’ dress code and noting that, after killing 
the LaBiancas, they’d helped themselves “to a snack from the icebox.” 

It was a four-day fusillade of specificity. Finally, on December 4, the 
president of the Los Angeles County Bar had had enough. “Bar Chief Scores 
Atkins Attorney over Tate Comments,” read the Santa Monica Evening 


Outlook’s front page, quoting him as he accused Caballero and Caruso of 
“entirely improper and unethical” conduct by “revealing vital facts about the 
Sharon Tate murder case from the viewpoint of Miss Atkins.” 

But the scrutiny didn’t last. Amid the swell of coverage on the murders, 
no one seemed to mind the lawyers’ leaking. In a passing remark to the Los 
Angeles Times on the day before Atkins’s grand jury testimony, Caballero 
more or less admitted that he wasn’t acting in his client’s best interest, saying 
he was “gambling that her voluntary testimony might save her from the gas 
chamber”—“gambling” and “might” being the operative words. 

Bugliosi and his team had essentially arranged for the defense lawyers to 
taint the jury on the prosecution’s behalf: everyone in Los Angeles was 
suddenly an expert on the Manson Family. Meanwhile, on December 4, as 
they continued their press tour, Caballero and Caruso met with the DAs to 
finalize their “deal.” Bugliosi described it as “excellent”; it was, in fact, 
nonexistent. As all the parties present would later admit during the death- 
penalty phase of the trial, nothing was ever formalized or signed. 

The next day, Atkins testified before the grand jury, as promised. The 
papers reported that Manson, Atkins, Linda Kasabian, Patricia Krenwinkel, 
Leslie Van Houten, and Tex Watson had been indicted on seven counts of 
murder after only twenty minutes of deliberation. 

Soon after, Caballero and Caruso walked away from the case, richer and 
more famous, with no apparent regrets. A reporter asked Bugliosi if he would 
have gotten the indictments without Atkins’s cooperation. He answered, “Do 
the French drink wine?” 


The Shape-Shifting Deal 


When Bugliosi made his “deal” with Caballero, he knew full well that Atkins 
was an unstable witness and a murderer. He needed her to get indictments for 
the other members of the Family, but he also needed a pretext to back away 
from her after she’d served her purpose. It wouldn’t look good if he could 
only score convictions by easing up on one of the killers. His reversal would 
be a lot easier since the deal wasn’t on paper, but even so, he’d have to 
provide some explanation if and when the prosecution parted ways with her. 
Before Bugliosi put Atkins in front of the grand jury, he approved an odd 


request from her lawyers: to have her removed from jail and brought to their 
offices in Beverly Hills for a taped interview. In Helter Skelter, calling the 
arrangement “unusual” but “not unprecedented,” Bugliosi claimed that his 
team went along with it because they thought Atkins would speak more 
freely away from her fellow inmates. But it also set up a chain of events that 
allowed the prosecutor to rid himself of her. 

In the comfort of Caballero’s office, Atkins spoke on tape for two and a 
half hours about her role in the murders. Listening the next day, Bugliosi 
noticed that she’d changed her story. At first, she’d told her cellmates that 
she’d stabbed Sharon Tate. Now she claimed that she couldn’t bring herself 
to do it, and instead held Tate by the arms while Watson stabbed her. That’s 
what she told the grand jury, too: that she didn’t kill Sharon Tate. But the 
discrepancy wasn’t a problem for Bugliosi as long as he got his indictments. 

Throughout Helter Skelter, Bugliosi inadvertently proved how malleable 
the Atkins deal was, describing it in different terms at different times. Early 
in the narrative, he said that all she had to do was testify truthfully to the 
grand jury and cooperate with authorities; she’d never have to testify against 
her codefendants at the actual trial. In exchange, the prosecution would 
consider not asking for the death penalty. 

But after the grand jury, the deal changed. Suddenly, she did have to 
testify against the others. Without her, “we still didn’t have a case,” Bugliosi 
wrote. Later still, he said that the prosecution was “stuck” with Atkins on the 
stand because of the deal, bemoaning the fact that he’d made an agreement 
with a killer. 

I tend to think this is all rhetorical hand-wringing—a way of upping the 
stakes in his book when really he knew that Atkins was never going to take 
the stand. 

Caballero, in fact, was doing everything in his power to lead his client 
away from testifying. He allowed Atkins to take visits from her former 
friends in the Family, who came bearing messages from Manson. The lawyer 
knew full well that, given enough exposure to her former lifestyle, Atkins 
was likely to return to Manson’s fold and refute her grand jury testimony. It 
worked. One day, she called Caballero and told him that she refused to testify 
at the trial. It was her first step toward formally undoing everything—except 
the indictments, which couldn’t be undone. Bugliosi fretted that he’d lost his 
“star witness.” 


But inwardly, he must have been pleased. Although he omitted it from his 
book, he was already in negotiations with the attorney of Linda Kasabian, a 
far more sympathetic witness, to cut a deal and take Atkins’s place at the 
trial. Of course, had Atkins’s attorneys been independently appointed, they 
would’ve reminded the prosecution of the terms of her deal, which precluded 
her testimony at the trial. Now Bugliosi could claim that she’d violated the 
deal and would lose her security against the death penalty. 

Atkins kept unraveling. On March 5, 1970, in the attorney’s room at the 
Central County Jail, Caballero presided over an hour-long reunion between 
his client and Manson. He described it as “joyous,” adding that Atkins and 
Manson “both burst into laughter when their eyes met for the first time in five 
months.” The meeting was only possible because Judge William Keene had 
granted Manson the right to represent himself—an allowance that shocked 
the courtroom. As his own attorney, Manson was entitled to meet with his 
jailed codefendants on the pretext of interviewing them as possible witnesses 
in the case against him. Among his first requested interviews was the woman 
responsible for his indictment: Susan Atkins. 

After their meeting, a reporter asked Atkins if Manson had ordered her to 
“change the story she related to the grand jury.” Atkins responded just as 
Caballero and the prosecution always knew she would: “Charlie doesn’t give 
orders. Charlie doesn’t command”—contradicting the thrust of her grand jury 
testimony, of course. 

The day after the meeting, Atkins fired Caballero and Caruso. She 
announced that she was recanting her grand jury testimony and formally 
declined to testify for the state. That same day, Judge Keene revoked 
Manson’s right to represent himself, arguing that he had filed too many 
“outlandish” and “nonsensical” motions. 

Caballero later testified that, after he was fired, he didn’t check in with the 
prosecution about the status of Atkins’s deal. But in an interview with the 
Hollywood Citizen News several weeks after his firing, he made the status of 
the deal crystal clear: it didn’t exist. “Susan Atkins’ former attorney, Richard 
Caballero, said that no deal had been made which caused her to testify before 
the grand jury,” the paper reported. 

The “excellent deal” that Bugliosi had written of was no deal at all. Its 
nonexistence has gone unnoticed all these years. Who cares about the legal 
vagaries of a confessed killer like Susan Atkins? But without this hoax of a 


deal—and the lawyer swap that enabled it—Manson and his followers may 
never have been indicted, and the reigning narrative of Manson as an all- 
controlling cult leader may never have come out. 

Gary Fleischman, Linda Kasabian’s attorney—he now goes by Gary 
Fields—told me that he was convinced the DA was “instrumental in getting 
Dick Caballero appointed,” and that Bugliosi never had any intention of 
keeping his deal with Atkins. “They used [her] to get an indictment,” he said, 
“and then they dumped her because they couldn’t use her at trial because she 
was dirty.” The whole thing “smelled to high heaven,” he continued. 
“Caballero and Caruso got away with fucking murder. They sold her down 
the river.” It was a stunning assessment from Fields. No one had benefited 
more from Caballero and Caruso’s dirty dealings than his client. 


Ice Cream for Atkins 


Caballero had another coup during his tenure as Atkins’s lawyer: he made 
sure that her story was heard around the world, in all its gory, self- 
incriminating detail. 

A few days before Atkins’s grand jury testimony, her attorneys met with a 
self-described “Hollywood journalist and communicator” named Lawrence 
Schiller to negotiate the publication of her firsthand account of the murders. 
Essentially, the text would be an edited transcription of the recording she’d 
made in Caballero’s office, with her byline slapped on it. Caballero and 
Caruso later claimed that they intended for the story to appear only overseas, 
far from the eyes of any potential jurors in Los Angeles. But such was not the 
case. On Sunday, December 14, Atkins’s byline landed on the front page of 
the Los Angeles Times. “Her” piece ran to 6,500 words, spilling across three 
full pages. 

The piece was an immediate sensation, far and away the most robust 
account of the Manson murders available to the public. Readers in Los 
Angeles—and within twenty-four hours, in nearly every place on the planet 
with a printing press—now had all the lurid details, including those that had 
been kept from the public by both the prosecution and the other killers’ 
defense attorneys. The piece spiked a vulgar account of the bloodshed with 
hints of Atkins’s naive girlishness. “My lawyer is coming soon,” it ended, 


“and he’s bringing me a dish of vanilla ice cream. Vanilla ice cream really 
blows my mind.” As Rolling Stone put it later, “Any doubts about Manson’s 
power to cloud men’s minds were buried that morning between Dick Tracy 
and one of the world’s great real estate sections.” 

And that, it seemed, was the real purpose of the piece—to eliminate any 
doubts about Manson the public might’ve had. In just the first column of the 
article, Atkins used the word “instructed” five times in reference to Manson’s 
role in the killings. Everything she and the Family did was on Manson’s 
orders, she said. He was a criminal mastermind, a cult leader, a conspiring 
lunatic. 

The task of assembling an unbiased jury was suddenly a lot harder. A 
spokesperson for the Southern California branch of the American Civil 
Liberties Union told Newsweek, “The interview makes it all but impossible 
for [the defendants] to get a fair trial in Los Angeles.” Bugliosi, craving 
convictions and the deluge of publicity from a high-profile trial, was 
presumably unbothered by this. 

But Caballero should’ve been bothered. Even though this piece was in 
effect a continuation of the many detailed press conferences he’d given, he 
went through the motions of outrage. Claiming to be “shocked and 
surprised,” he told the press that Schiller had double-crossed him, breaking a 
promise that the story wouldn’t appear in the United States. Although 
Caballero threatened lawsuits, they never materialized. 

Nor did Caballero make any effort to halt the dissemination of the story, 
which continued apace. One week later, Schiller released an expanded 
version in a “quickie” paperback called The Killing of Sharon Tate: Exclusive 
Story by Susan Atkins, Confessed Participant in the Murder. In the 
acknowledgments, he thanked “several attorneys involved in this case” and 
“two journalists,” writing, “Without their help this book could not have been 
produced.” 


Bugliosi maintained that his office had no idea the story was coming until 
that fateful issue of the Times landed on his doorstep. He hadn’t learned a 
thing about the sale of Atkins’s story, he claimed in Helter Skelter, until the 
death-penalty phase of the trial. At that point, since Atkins was eligible for 
the death penalty, her (third) new attorney, Daye Shinn, made an attempt to 


save her life by arguing that Caballero had misrepresented her. He called on 
everyone involved in the publication of her story to explain themselves. 
Reading the transcript, I learned that the DA’s office not only was aware of 
the planned publication, but may have facilitated it. And, of course, Helter 
Skelter left all of this out. 

The key to the scheme was Lawrence Schiller, the so-called 
communicator who’d brokered the publication deal. This wasn’t Schiller’s 
first high-profile article. Among other pieces, he’d arranged to publish the 
“deathbed confession” of Lee Harvey Oswald’s murderer, Jack Ruby; nude 
photos of Marilyn Monroe; and photos of the comedian Lenny Bruce lying 
dead on his bathroom floor. He finished the Atkins deal on December 8, 
when the contract was signed—just in the nick of time. Two days later, Judge 
Keene issued a gag order, making it illegal for anyone involved to talk to the 
press. 

That should’ve brought a decisive end to the publication. But in violation 
of the gag order, Caballero drove Jerry Cohen, a Los Angeles Times reporter 
and a friend of Schiller, to interview his client in jail. Cohen had been tapped 
to ghostwrite the piece. His main source was the taped account that Atkins 
had made in Caballero’s office. But apparently he needed more material, and 
the lawyer was happy to accommodate him. 

In the car that evening, besides Caballero and Cohen, were Schiller and a 
stenographer, Carmella Ambrosini. At the jail, Cohen and Ambrosini went 
inside to interview Atkins. The purpose of the visit, as recorded in the 
visitors’ log at Sybil Brand, was to discuss a “future psychiatric evaluation.” 

Remember, Caballero had earlier claimed that Atkins could speak safely 
only at his Beverly Hills offices. Now a journalist and a stenographer were 
talking with her right there in jail. They spoke for about an hour. When they 
got back in the car, Caballero made an unusual demand of Ambrosini: he told 
the stenographer to pull out a small section of the tape from her machine, 
maybe about three minutes’ worth, and give it to him. Caballero “ripped the 
tape into tiny pieces,” Ambrosini later testified, “and then threw them on the 
floor of the car. Then he picked them up from the floor and put them into his 
pocket.” 

On the stand, Caballero finally admitted that the taped section contained 
comments from Atkins suggesting that she’d lied to the grand jury at his 
direction. She’d said something to the effect of “Okay, I played your game. I 


testified. I said what you wanted me to say, I don’t want to do it anymore”— 
at which point he told her to stop talking. Under more persistent questioning, 
Caballero conceded that Atkins “used the word ‘lie’” and “appeared” to be 
“repudiating” her grand jury testimony. 

It was the closest thing to an admission that Caballero had manipulated 
Atkins—that her testimony, and all the indictments that stemmed from it, 
were unreliable. But again, because Atkins was a confessed murderer, this 
hardly seemed remarkable to the media. And, of course, the story of how 
Caballero and Caruso became Atkins’s attorneys was locked in police vaults 
until I found it. 


“Something Very Smelly” 


Jerry Cohen was a ghostwriter in the purest sense of the word. No one was 
supposed to know that he’d finessed Atkins’s words, let alone that he’d 
interviewed her in jail. To that end, Lawrence Schiller had presented himself 
unambiguously as Atkins’s interlocutor. “I will be the first and the last 
newsman with whom Susan Atkins can speak freely until her fate is decided,” 
he wrote in the paperback version of the Atkins story. 

In fact, Schiller had been sitting outside in the car while Cohen talked to 
Atkins in jail. After that interview, Cohen ripped through his ghostwriting in 
two days at Schiller’s house. Schiller made three carbon copies of the 
finished piece: one for Caballero; one for a German editor who’d bought the 
translation rights; and one to be flown overseas to the London News of the 
World, which had paid $40,000 for exclusive English rights. Or so said 
Bugliosi, who wrote in Helter Skelter, “How the Los Angeles Times obtained 
the story remains unknown.” 

Bugliosi did not write that Cohen, a reporter for the Times, was also a 
friend and collaborator of his. That relationship came out only when Bugliosi 
himself appeared as a witness during the trial’s penalty phase. Under cross- 
examination, he admitted that he’d known Cohen for the “last two or three 
years.” As he later confirmed to me, he was collaborating with Cohen on a 
book of his own: not Helter Skelter, but Till Death Do Us Part, another true- 
crime chronicle (it eventually appeared in 1978 with another coauthor). The 
two men had begun work on the book before Sharon Tate was even 


murdered; Bugliosi set it aside when he realized that the Manson murders 
would be the more sensational story. 

The defense alleged that Bugliosi had helped broker the publication of 
Atkins’s story. They never proved it, in part because Jerry Cohen had dodged 
subpoena servers and never testified. But certainly it was a point in their 
favor that Bugliosi had omitted his working relationship with the reporter 
who ghostwrote the story—and that said reporter worked for the same 
newspaper where the story eventually appeared. 

As for Schiller: in his turn on the stand, he did finally admit that he never 
met Susan Atkins. But afterward he claimed in interviews with Vanity Fair, 
Playboy, and the New York Times, and even in his Pulitzer Prize-winning 
collaboration with Norman Mailer, The Executioner’s Song, that he’d 
interviewed Atkins in her cell. 


Cohen’s ghostwriting would’ve remained a secret if not for Pete Miller, an 
investigative reporter for Los Angeles’s KTTV. In January 1970, as 
preliminary hearings continued in the Manson case, he decided to look into 
the Atkins sale. He wanted to see if Lawrence Schiller had actually 
interviewed Atkins in her jail cell, as he’d claimed he had. 

Miller checked the jail’s visitors’ log and saw that Schiller had never been 
in to see Atkins. But he did notice a name he recognized: Jerry Cohen’s, 
appearing alongside Caballero’s. On the phone, Caballero admitted that he’d 
brought Cohen “in case he wanted to prepare a psychiatric defense” for 
Atkins. Miller pointed out that Cohen was a reporter, not a psychiatrist, and 
Caballero abruptly ended the conversation. 

Miller tried to bring this to light, but he couldn’t get very far. After his 
initial reports aired in January 1970, Bugliosi requested a meeting with him. 
The two sat down at KTTV’s headquarters, along with Caballero, a second 
DA, Miller’s bosses, and attorneys for the station. 

This meeting came up during the penalty phase of the trial, when the 
defense called Miller to testify. He tried to say what they’d discussed and 
why no more stories aired after his first one, but Bugliosi objected every step 
of the way. All he could get out was that they’d talked about “some of the 
reports I had been doing... concerning Susan Atkins.” 

“As a result of this meeting, was something done regarding your further 


broadcasts of this case?” asked Daye Shinn, Atkins’s attorney. 

“Objection!” cried Bugliosi. “Irrelevant.” 

“Sustained,” responded the court. 

Shinn tried again later. “As a result of this meeting did you further 
terminate—” 

“Objection!” Bugliosi said again. “Irrelevant.” 

“Will you complete the question?” the judge asked Shinn. 

“As a result of this meeting did you further terminate the broadcasts 
concerning this case?” 

“Objection! Irrelevant.” 

“Sustained.” 

Out of earshot of the jury, Bugliosi told the judge, “Miller’s testimony has 
nothing to do with death as opposed to life. It is my contention that [the 
defense attorneys] are going to use this death-penalty hearing as a forum to 
sling dirt at various people.” Including, of course, him. The judge said he 
wouldn’t allow any mention of what happened at the meeting. It constituted 
hearsay. 

Thus the prosecutor kept much of Miller’s investigation under wraps. 
Most of the media covering the trial never even mentioned the Miller 
appearance. The Los Angeles Times omitted him entirely, focusing instead, as 
they always had, on the litany of bizarre behavior from the defendants and 
their supporters outside the courthouse. 


Under oath, both Bugliosi and his coprosecutor, Aaron Stovitz, denied that 
they knew about the sale of Atkins’s story before it was published. Maybe 
inadvertently, Richard Caballero impeached their testimony. 

Under questioning by the defense’s Irving Kanarek, Caballero said, “I did 
State to someone at the district attorney’s office—I believe it was Mr. Stovitz, 
I may be wrong—that I had entered into the arrangement for the sale of the 
story... And they were upset.” 

“Who is ‘they’?” Kanarek asked. 

“I believe Mr. Stovitz was there, and I am almost positive someone else 
was there... but I cannot recall who.” 

Kanarek did his best to bring out the implication that this “someone else” 
was Bugliosi. Caballero, in a response worthy of the CIA, neither confirmed 


nor denied it. 

After the Atkins story came out, Lawrence Schiller spoke to Newsweek, 
which asked how he’d been able to penetrate the security surrounding the 
State’s “star” witness, risking a mistrial by publishing her story. He answered 
“with a grin”: “Let’s say this, the prosecution didn’t put up any obstacles.” 

I was more than ready to believe him on that count. But what about the 
judge, William Keene—why didn’t he put up any obstacles? The worldwide 
publication of Atkins’s story was about as blatant a violation of his gag order 
as one can imagine, but he never held Caballero and Caruso in contempt. In a 
story for the Los Angeles Free Press, Ed Sanders, who would go on to write 
The Family, argued that Judge Keene must’ve known in advance about the 
publication, letting it slide because he, like Bugliosi, wanted the publicity 
from the case. Keene was considering a run for district attorney. 

After Atkins’s story was published, Linda Kasabian’s attorney, Gary 
Fields, filed a motion to dismiss the case because of unfair pretrial publicity. 
Judge Keene denied the motion, despite abundant evidence of publicity. 
“That’s where the story is,” Fields told me thirty years later. “Something very 
smelly there.” 


“A Strange Little Guy” 


Richard Caballero refused to discuss the case with me. “The answer is no 
thank you,” he said on the phone. I asked him why not. “The answer is no 
thank you,” he said. I tried one more time, saying I wanted to discuss the sale 
of the Atkins story. “The answer is no thank you!” he shouted, hanging up 
the phone. 

Lawrence Schiller wouldn’t talk to me, either, and Jerry Cohen had died 
by his own hand, in 1993. Looking into those two men, I found that 
throughout the sixties, their journalism had often gotten them mixed up in 
furtive arrangements. In ’67, Schiller had published the first book to attack 
the conspiracy theorists around John F. Kennedy’s assassination, staunchly 
supporting the official explanation for JFK’s death. That same year, 
foreshadowing his feat at Sybil Brand, Schiller wormed his way into the 
Dallas hospital room of Jack Ruby, who’d killed Kennedy’s assassin, Lee 
Harvey Oswald. The reporter emerged with the only recording ever made of 


Ruby’s confessing to the murder. Schiller released it on vinyl that year. 
Notably, he’d taped Ruby saying that he hadn’t killed Oswald as part of a 
conspiracy, thus shoring up the government’s official line. 

During a congressional investigation of the CIA’s illegal domestic 
operations, the agency admitted that it had more than 250 “assets” in the 
American media in the 1960s. Their identities were never revealed. Mark 
Lane, who’d written the first book questioning the findings of the Warren 
Commission—the investigative committee appointed by President Lyndon 
Johnson, which concluded that Kennedy was killed by a lone assassin— 
believed Schiller was one of those assets, and Jerry Cohen, too. Lane 
believed they’d been tasked with disrupting investigations of the Kennedy 
assassination. In testimony before Congress, Lane charged that the CIA had 
paid Cohen to “smear” him in the press. 

I could never prove that, but I did find a trove of documents in the 
National Archives showing that Schiller had been acting as an informant for 
the FBI in 1967 and 1968, sharing confidential information with the Bureau 
about Mark Lane’s sources. His work as an informant continued under the 
cloak of his “reporting” for Life magazine, which was later named in a 1977 
Rolling Stone story as one of the publications that provided CIA employees 
with cover. Schiller tracked down authorities who were investigating 
potential malfeasance in the Kennedy assassination, using his press 
credentials to obtain interviews and then sharing his findings with the FBI. 
He’d written to [[J Edgar Hoover]] to say that he was “in possession of the 
names and whereabouts of [the] confidential informant whom Mr. [Mark] 
Lane refused to identify” in his testimony to the Warren Commission. 
Schiller dug up information about officials looking into the CIA’s 
involvement in the Kennedy assassination. According to memos, the FBI 
eagerly awaited Schiller’s information. 

Others had made similar claims about Cohen and Schiller. Pete Noyes, a 
TV investigative reporter who’d written a book on the assassinations of 
President Kennedy and his brother Robert, said that Cohen, a friend, had 
pressured him to abandon the project. If Noyes dropped the publication of the 
book, Cohen promised him a plum job at the Los Angeles Times. Noyes 
declined the offer, but he was disturbed by how much Cohen knew about his 
unpublished work. A few weeks later, he was fired from his job at CBS 
News. Cohen was “a strange little guy,” Noyes told me. He wondered why 


his onetime friend tried to quash his book, and he suspected that Cohen had 
played a role in his firing, too. Although he could never prove it, Noyes was 
fairly certain that Cohen was a CIA asset. 


Coda: What Did Atkins Really Say? 


Susan Atkins’s testimony was the blueprint for the official narrative of the 
murders. But if it was shaped to serve the prosecution, how much of it should 
we believe? 

If there’s an unvarnished account—a sense of what Atkins said about the 
crimes before she came under the “control” of her attorneys and the DA’s 
office—it’s the one she shared with her cellmate Ronnie Howard. We’ll 
never get to hear that account verbatim, but there’s something that comes 
close. In the files of LAPD lieutenant Paul LePage, I found notes from 
detectives’ November 18, 1969, interview with Howard; they contained 
several inconsistencies with what would become Atkins’s official story. And 
by the time Howard was reinterviewed seven days later—after Caballero’s 
insertion in the case—she changed what she said, and all of these 
discrepancies were gone. To my knowledge, they’ve never been reported. 

First: Atkins told Howard that Sharon Tate died in her bedroom, on the 
bed. (Later, she was said to have died in the living room.) 

Second: she said the killers were tripping on LSD the night of the Tate 
murders. If that were true, the defense could’ve argued that they had 
“diminished capacity,” thus sparing them the gas chamber. Bugliosi, wanting 
to eliminate that possibility, made Linda Kasabian testify on multiple 
occasions that no one took any drugs on the nights of the murders. (In a 2009 
documentary, Kasabian contradicted her testimony, saying that all the killers 
had taken speed on the night of the Tate murders.) 

Third: Atkins said that they killed the LaBianca couple because of 
something to do with “blackmail,” although she couldn’t elaborate. She said 
she’d participated in those murders, too—she was the one who left the 
kitchen fork protruding from Leno LaBianca’s belly. (In the official narrative, 
Atkins was in the car that brought the killers to the LaBiancas’, but she never 
went inside the house.) 

What’s just as remarkable is everything that Howard didn’t mention in 


that first interview. She said nothing about Helter Skelter, Manson’s race 
war, except to note that those words were left in blood on the LaBianca 
refrigerator. She made no mention, in other words, of a racist motive, black 
people, holes in the desert, Armageddon, or the Beatles, all of which became 
central to Bugliosi’s prosecution. 

And, as you might expect by now, she made no mention of Manson’s 
“instructing” anyone to go anywhere or kill anyone—all of which would be 
repeated incessantly in Atkins’s later accounts. 

As for Atkins’s most heinous act—the stabbing of Sharon Tate as she 
begged for the life of her baby—Howard was much more equivocal about it 
than we’ve been led to believe. She said that Atkins “didn’t admit she did the 
stabbing on the Tate deal.” And yet, the next time Howard talked, after 
Caballero had arrived, she said without reservation that Atkins had boasted 
about stabbing Tate in nauseating detail. 


Think of all the unanswered questions that have swirled around the Manson 
case for fifty years now. Just a few: Why did the killers target strangers for 
murder? Why would previously nonviolent kids—except for Atkins, none of 
them had a criminal record—kill for Manson, on command, and with such 
abandon and lack of remorse? And if Manson hoped to ignite a world-ending 
race war, why didn’t he order more killings, since the two nights of murder 
didn’t trigger that war? 

Bugliosi made a fortune and achieved worldwide fame from his 
prosecution of the Manson Family and Helter Skelter. Over the years, many 
people in law enforcement have told me that they never believed the Helter 
Skelter motive. Their theories were always more mundane—they would’ve 
made thinner gruel for Bugliosi’s book. 

Eventually, all the killers settled on a story similar to the one that Atkins 
told after her attorney swap. And all of them have sought parole releases 
based on that story’s thesis: that they were not responsible for their actions 
because they were under Manson’s control. Many of the psychiatrists who 
testified said that the defendants’ minds had been so decimated by LSD that 
they likely had no way of discerning real memories from false ones. They 
may not even have known if they were at either house on the nights of the 
killings, let alone whether they participated in the murders. 


The only person who never endorsed Atkins’s final story, and the Helter 
Skelter motive along with it, was Manson. After his conviction, he said little 
about the crimes, except that he didn’t know what his “children” were going 
to do before they did it, and that he had no explanation for why they’d done 
it. Curiously, Bugliosi admitted in one of his last interviews that he was 
pretty certain Manson never believed in Helter Skelter. “I think everyone who 
participated in the murders bought the Helter Skelter theory hook, line, and 
sinker,” he told Rolling Stone. “But did Manson himself believe in all this 
ridiculous, preposterous stuff about all of them living in a bottomless pit in 
the desert while a worldwide war went on outside? I think, without knowing, 
that he did not.” Unfortunately, the reporter didn’t follow up with the obvious 
rejoinder: If the murders weren’t committed to incite a race war, what was the 
reason? 

As I’ve mentioned before, there was a persistent rumor among followers 
of the case, including the detectives who’d investigated it, that Manson had 
visited the Tate house after the murders, arriving with some unknown 
companion to restage the crime scene. If it’s true that Susan Atkins’s story 
was the product of careful sculpting by the DA’s office, the prospect of 
Manson’s visitation isn’t nearly as far-fetched as it would be otherwise. 

One of the more perplexing clues to that end is a pair of eyeglasses 
recovered from Tate’s living room after the murders. They didn’t belong to 
any of the victims; they didn’t belong to any of the murderers; they didn’t 
seem to belong to anyone, period. Detectives never explained them to 
anyone’s satisfaction. In a 1986 book called Manson in His Own Words, 
ostensibly cowritten by Manson and an ex-con named Nuel Emmons, 
Manson mentioned these glasses, saying he went to the Cielo house with an 
unnamed conspirator and took elaborate measures to rearrange the crime 
scene. “My partner had an old pair of eyeglasses which we often used as a 
magnifying glass or a device to start a fire when matches weren’t available,” 
he wrote. “We carefully wiped the glasses free of prints and dropped them on 
the floor, so that, when discovered, they would be a misleading clue for the 
police.” 

To be clear, Manson in His Own Words is a far from unimpeachable 
source. Emmons wrote the book years after a series of prison interviews with 
Manson, but he wasn’t allowed to record these or take notes at the time. 
Manson himself vaguely disavowed the book, although not before appearing 


with Emmons in several televised interviews to promote it. 

I was inclined to take a kinder view toward it when I found, in the LASO 
files, a “kite,” or prison note, from Manson to Linda Kasabian. His coded 
language is hard to decipher, but he may have been admitting that he left the 
glasses at the Cielo house after the murders. The note seems to have been 
delivered in an effort to persuade Kasabian not to make a deal with the 
prosecution: 


So what if I did make you do it I don’t care if you’re a snitch... you 
been a lien bitch... I did what I did because I felt it was to be done & I 
even put the eye glasses to where I could show you all are blind & give 
them Shorty... each time you skiw down you think of Sharon Tate & 
know that’s you if I can’t get to my Nancy’s love... 


The next lines had been underlined by police: “tell Gold to hold the bone 
yard and no bones outside the yard.” 

While it’s always difficult to decode anything Manson said or wrote, this 
note isn’t as impenetrable as others. “Gold” was Manson’s nickname for one 
of his Family favorites, Nancy Pitman, whom he had referred to as “Nancy” a 
few lines earlier. In early 1970, Pitman paid frequent visits to all the 
defendants in jail, doing Manson’s bidding. She told Linda Kasabian not to 
turn state’s evidence; she told Atkins to stop cooperating with the 
prosecution. “Shorty” refers to Shorty Shea, the Spahn Ranch caretaker 
whom the Family had killed and buried in a remote part of the property; as 
mentioned earlier, his remains weren’t recovered until 1977. 

To hazard a guess: Manson was warning Kasabian not to flip, and 
instructing her to tell “Gold,” when next she visited, that Shorty Shea’s 
“bones” were not to be removed from “the bone yard” at the Spahn Ranch 
where he was buried. Manson even may have been referring to other victims’ 
buried remains at the ranch; it’s long been suspected that more victims of the 
Family are buried somewhere. While the implications of the note are 
sensational, what’s more important to me is Manson’s apparent admission 
that he returned to the Tate house after the murders and planted the glasses. 

I expected investigators to dismiss the possibility of Manson’s meddling 
at the scene, but some were open to it. Late in my reporting, I spoke with 


Danny Bowser, a retired lieutenant from the LAPD homicide squad who’d 
never given an interview about Manson. In 1965 Bowser had been appointed 
the first commander of the LAPD’s new Special Investigations Section (SIS), 
an elite, high-tech unit that served as “professional witnesses” by running 
covert surveillance on known criminals. Its goal was to gather such a 
preponderance of evidence that convictions were all but guaranteed, and plea 
bargains all but impossible. And the SIS was a furtive bunch: for a decade, 
the LAPD never even publicly acknowledged its existence. “We weren’t even 
connected to a division,” Bowser told the Los Angeles Times in 1988. “They 
carried us [on the roster] at different places, different times.” 

That was the only time Bowser ever commented about the SIS. A second 
piece reported that SIS was called the “Death Squad” within the LAPD 
because its members had killed thirty-four suspects since 1965. The 
“secretive” twenty-man unit had a controversial policy: it refused to intervene 
to stop crimes, even those in which people’s lives were at stake. The Times 
investigation “documented numerous instances in which well-armed teams of 
SIS detectives stood by watching as victims were threatened with death and, 
sometimes, physically harmed by criminals who could have been arrested 
beforehand.” The later piece in the Times reported that “Even within the 
LAPD, SIS officers are known as a fearsome and mysterious bunch. Some of 
their colleagues repeat unsubstantiated—and vigorously denied—rumors of 
SIS officers conspiring to shoot suspects and celebrating gunfights with ‘kill 
parties.’” 

Pd heard from other detectives that, after Sharon Tate’s murder, the 
LAPD assigned Bowser to serve as Roman Polanski’s “bodyguard.” Why 
would such an elite officer get such a low-level task? Polanski confirmed the 
assignment in his 1984 autobiography, Roman by Polanski, writing that 
Bowser had been the first detective to interview him and had shadowed his 
every move. He added somewhat cryptically that “Bowser wasn’t, strictly 
speaking, on the investigative side of the case... One of his responsibilities 
was to keep in touch with me.” Why, then, was his name never mentioned in 
Helter Skelter or at the trial? 

I had trouble finding a way to talk to Bowser. Finally, in 2008, I settled on 
a time-honored reportorial tactic: I showed up at his doorstep unannounced. 
He lived way out in Inyo County, five hours from L.A., at the end of a quiet 
suburban Street. 


Bowser refused to let me in, saying he wouldn’t talk to me. Despite his 
advanced age, he cut an imposing figure—he had a glass eye, and I later 
learned that his real eye had been shot out—but I kept him standing in his 
doorway by blurting out questions about the Tate crime scene, hoping to 
convince him that Pd done my homework. It worked—kind of. Bowser 
would shut the door on me, only to open it again to say more. Whenever he 
seemed to have said his piece, he’d find something else to add. For the next 
thirty minutes, as the sprinklers chirped next door and a TV blared from 
inside his house, he told me things that he insisted he’d never shared outside 
the SIS. 

Most of our stilted conversation was about the homicide investigation 
report for the Tate case, a document that was pretty much the basis of the 
prosecution’s physical evidence. Bowser said it was littered with 
inaccuracies. The detectives in the homicide unit, he claimed, “left things 
behind, things they missed... an awful lot of evidence didn’t get processed.” 

At least two key pieces of physical evidence weren’t, in fact, discovered at 
the crime scene the morning of the murders, although more than a dozen 
police officers and forensic investigators had testified that they had been. One 
was that mysterious pair of eyeglasses. Bowser told me he’d found those 
himself, five entire days after the murders. That contradicted the homicide 
report, which said the glasses had been located and taken into custody on 
August 9, 1969. Gently, I suggested he might be mistaken—that the homicide 
report suggested otherwise. 

“What, you think that’s the Bible?” He snorted. “You believe the stuff 
you read in there?” He made sure I didn’t jump to the conclusion that he or 
any of the SIS agents working under him had done anything improper. He 
said that his guys didn’t write reports, nor did they report to anyone. 
Nevertheless, if what he said was true, then critical elements of the 
prosecution’s presentation of the crime scene were inaccurate. Included, just 
for starters, would be the means of entry into the house, the way the victims 
were bound and by whom. “Everything evil over there kind of connects,” he 
added. 

If he was accurate, then all those cops—his colleagues at the LAPD—had 
lied under oath, I reminded him. 

“Did you see any of my guys on the stand?” he asked. And he added that I 
wouldn’t find any of his “guys” named in the police reports, either. He was 


right. 

Toward the end, Bowser toyed with giving me a proper interview. “I was 
going to give you my number,” he said before shutting the door again, “to 
protect you from stumbling over your dick. But I changed my mind.” I waited 
a good ten minutes, but the door remained closed this time, and I finally left. 
Two years later, in 2010, he died. 

As I drove away, my mind was awash with possibilities. I’d always 
wondered about the crime-scene discrepancies. I wondered if Bowser, just by 
alleging that the crime scene had been presented incorrectly or possibly even 
staged, was pointing to other reasons for the murders, or other people, 
perhaps, involved in covering up what had really happened. I had to think of 
Reeve Whitson, and his claim of having gone to the crime scene after the 
murders but before the police had arrived. 

All of this is compelling evidence of a different scenario for the crimes, 
but I’ll be the first to admit that it proves nothing for certain. I do believe it’s 
possible that there was another reason for the Tate—LaBianca murders. And I 
do believe the crime scene suggests that the sequence of events as we know it 
is wrong. But our best chance to learn the truth vanished in November 1969, 
when the DA’s office put Susan Atkins’s testimony on lockdown. The 
question remaining was: Why?

Manson’s Get-Out-of-Jail-Free Card 


No More Extensions 


Good reporting takes time—vast and often unreasonable amounts of time. 
Behind every solid lead, quotable interview, and bombshell document, I put 
in weeks of scut work that led to dozens of dead ends. My Freedom of 
Information Act requests alone would stretch on for months, as I quibbled 
with bureaucrats over redactions and minutiae. Since my three-month 
assignment from Premiere had long since evolved into a years-long project, 
Pd accepted that the Manson case was something akin to a calling, like it or 
not. Even in the longueurs between my major breakthroughs, I worked 
diligently with the confidence—and, sometimes, the hubris—that comes with 
the hunch that you’re onto something big. 

That confidence would’ve been nothing if my editors at Premiere didn’t 
share it. The camaraderie and support they offered was critical, but more 
basically than that, they were keeping me alive. For almost a year and a half, 
through one deadline extension after another, they paid me a generous 
monthly stipend to keep reporting, on top of the standard fee from my 
original contract. Even then, I knew that these paychecks were a tremendous 
act of faith, and I didn’t take them lightly. I wanted to deliver a news-making 
piece, unlike the usual stuff printed in entertainment magazines, and I thought 
I could do it. I just needed time. 

But there were limits to Premiere’s largesse. In November 2000, Jim 
Meigs—the editor in chief, who’d sat on the floor of my apartment, 
examining documents with me—was fired. I heard a rumor, which I could 


never confirm, that the handsome monthly payments he’d authorized for me 
were part of the problem. Whatever the case, Premiere’s new regime got 
down to brass tacks right away. In total, including expenses, they’d paid me a 
king’s ransom at that point, and now they demanded the goods. Immediately. 

Looking back, maybe I was too full of pride. I still can’t decide if what I 
did next was best for me in the long run. But I did it: I walked away from 
Premiere. I thought I had a historic story, and to publish it in that condition, 
with loose ends and so much research left to be done, would’ve been giving 
too much away. The minute I let it go, I thought, the Los Angeles Times or 
the Washington Post would put six reporters on the story to finish what I 
couldn’t. If they got the big scoop that had eluded me—the story of what 
really happened, as opposed to the millions of tiny holes in what was 
supposed to have happened—all the glory would be theirs, and I would be 
only a footnote. 

A writer friend had referred me to her literary agent, who took me on, 
convinced that I had an important book on my hands. If I could write up a 
proposal and sell it to a publisher, he said, I’d get the time and the money I 
needed to put my reporting to bed. He disentangled me from my obligation to 
Premiere and I started right away. 

It took more than a year to write the first draft of the proposal. My friends, 
many of whom were writers, could never understand why it was taking so 
long. Why not just sit down and crank the thing out? I was constantly on the 
defensive with them, looking for justifications. The problem, of course, was 
that I was still reporting. Because that’s what I always did. I never stopped. 

Without the backing of an institution like Premiere, my mind-set started 
to change—it was expanding. I found myself looking into Manson’s year in 
San Francisco. He was there for the summer of love, in 1967. It was where 
he’d formed the Family. I was flummoxed by the authority figures who’d 
surrounded Manson at this time: his parole officer and the locally renowned 
physician who ran the clinic where he and his followers received free health 
care. Neither of them had spoken much to the press, and neither had testified 
at the trial, despite the fact that each man had seen Manson almost daily in 
the critical period when he’d started his cult. 

These weren’t fringe figures like Reeve Whitson or William Herrmann: 
they were well-known and respected in the Bay Area, and, even better for me, 
they were still alive. So when I plunged into their stories with Manson and 


found evidence of serial dishonesty—again, often connected to federal law 
enforcement and intelligence agencies—I had to ask myself if I was crazy to 
be doing all of this. 

The question wasn’t whether it was “worth it”; I thought it was, assuming 
the truth could be wrested out of aging scientists, reformed hippies, and dusty 
government files. The question was how much of myself I was willing to 
give, irrespective of any consequences to my reputation or well-being. I was 
haunted by something Paul Krassner, a journalist who’d covered the trial for 
the legendary counterculture magazine The Realist, had told me after a lunch 
in the first months of my investigation. At a Venice Beach sushi bar, we’d 
been discussing our belief that the reasons behind the murders had been 
misrepresented. “Be careful, Tom,” he said as we parted ways. “This will 
take over your life if you let it.” 

I'd shrugged it off at the time. Now it felt like a prophecy. But if I wanted 
my book, or even just my proposal for the book, to be more complete than 
my Premiere piece would’ve been, I had to let the story consume me. 


Scot-Free in Mendocino 


To understand my fascination with Manson’s parole officer, you might pick 
up where we left off: with Susan Atkins. She was plainly pushed around by 
the DA’s office. Her story was cut and polished until it glimmered for the 
prosecutors, bringing indictments, convictions, and a raft of publicity. 

The more I learned about Atkins’s past, though, the stranger her 
manipulation became to me. In the years before the Family’s rise to notoriety, 
the justice system afforded her a shocking amount of latitude. If anything, 
she’d gotten away with far too much in those years. When she was on 
probation, she broke the law regularly, but her arrests never put her in any 
further legal jeopardy. Instead, there was a pattern of catch-and-release. 
Whenever the police brought her in, she’d find herself cut loose within a few 
days. Why was law enforcement so lenient with her? 

The events of June 4, 1969—about two months before the Tate—LaBianca 
murders—are as good a Starting point as any. At 3:30 that morning, an LAPD 
patrolman pulled over a ’68 Plymouth for speeding in the San Fernando 
Valley, ordering the driver to step out of the car. A small, long-haired man 


emerged, staggering toward him, his arms flailing in “wild gyrations.” “He 
appeared under the influence of some unknown intoxicant,” the officer later 
reported. 

It was Charles Manson. He was arrested and charged with driving under 
the influence, being on drugs, and operating a vehicle without a license. He 
had four passengers in the car, all arrested for being under the influence: 
Thomas J. Walleman, Nancy Pitman, Leslie Van Houten, and Susan Atkins. 

Within twenty-four hours, all of them—including Manson, who’d 
informed the booking officers that he was on federal parole—were released 
with no charges. All except Atkins. She was held for more than two weeks. 

The police had discovered a warrant for Atkins, not even a week old. On 
May 29, hundreds of miles away in Mendocino, a judge had ordered her 
arrest for violating five conditions of her probation. (Atkins had gotten a 
three-year probation sentence in 1968, after an arrest near Ukiah, California.) 
Now, notified of her arrest in Los Angeles, two Mendocino County sheriff’s 
deputies drove 1050 miles round-trip to scoop her up and bring her back up 
north. On June 7, she was booked into the Mendocino County jail. 

The state had a strong case against Atkins. She had probation officers in 
both L.A. and Mendocino, and neither was happy with her. According to 
their reports, she’d brazenly defied all attempts at supervision since her 
sentence was imposed. Since she’d received a courtesy transfer of her 
probation from Mendocino to Los Angeles County, she’d changed her 
address more than six times without permission. She hadn’t sought 
employment. She’d failed to check in for almost every monthly appointment. 
And most recently, she’d told the probation office that, although she knew it 
was forbidden, she was moving to the Mojave Desert with her friends, with 
no plan to return to L.A. 

Describing Atkins’s whereabouts as “totally unknown,” the probation 
office’s report advised, “The best thing is to revoke the defendant’s probation 
as it appears she has no intentions of abiding by it.” 

Despite that recommendation, at a hearing that month, Judge Wayne 
Burke of Mendocino County Superior Court decided that “the defendant has 
not violated probation. She has complied with the terms. Probation is 
reinstated and modified to terminate forewith. She is released.” Not only did 
the ruling defy the probation office—it seemed to reward Atkins’s bad 
behavior, “terminating” her probation more than two years before it was 


33 


scheduled to conclude. And off she went, soon to participate in the murders 
of at least eight people. The fact that she was nearly sent to prison so soon 
before the killings has never been reported. 

Hoping to shed some light on the deceased Judge Burke’s decision, I 
found the head of the Mendocino County Probation Office in 1969, Thomas 
Martin, who’d appeared at the hearing. I also spoke to Atkins’s L.A. 
probation officer, Margo Tompkins, who’d written the recommendation for 
her revocation. Both recalled their shock at the ruling. Calling it “very 
strange,” Tompkins said, “Judges almost always went along with a probation 
officer’s recommendation. Clearly she had not had any employment, no fixed 
addresses... I have no idea why [he] would have done that.” 

Martin said he’d never experienced anything like it in thirty-two years on 
the job. He was especially galled because they’d gone to the trouble of 
sending two police officers on the thousand-mile journey to retrieve Atkins. 
“That seldom, if ever, happened,” he said. Martin remembered Burke well; he 
felt the ruling must have had some ulterior motive. “Judge Burke was not just 
somebody in the woods,” he said. “There was something in his mind. 
Something that he knew that he never shared with us.” 


Whatever that something was, it had worked to Atkins’s benefit before. A 
year and a half earlier, an entirely different set of probation officers—in 
another state—had tried to have her probation revoked, and they met with an 
almost identical response from a different judge. 

Atkins was living in San Francisco then. She’d fallen in with a strange 
man who promised to change her life, and her probation officers weren’t 
thrilled about it. Her sudden infatuation with this “Charlie” meant she might 
backslide into the recklessness that had gotten her arrested in the first place, 
when she’d been found in a stolen car in Oregon with two ex-cons, one of 
whom she’d met while working as a stripper. It was the end of a crime spree 
for the trio. They’d stolen the car in California, driven it across the state line 
into Oregon, and held up a string of gas stations and convenience stores, with 
Atkins at the wheel. 

When they were apprehended outside Salem, she told the officer she 
would’ve shot and killed him if he hadn’t caught them by surprise. Then only 
eighteen, Atkins was convicted of being in possession of stolen goods and a 


concealed weapon. Her three-year probation sentence was transferred to San 
Francisco, where she promised to clean up her act. And so she had, until the 
summer of 67, when she’d fallen under Manson’s spell. 

According to probation records, Atkins phoned her San Francisco 
probation officer, Mary Yates, that November 10, saying that she’d joined a 
communal marriage with seven other women. They were all hitched to a 
“traveling minister” by the name of Charlie, fresh out of federal prison. 
Atkins and Charlie’s other “wives,” many of them pregnant by him, would 
soon be leaving San Francisco in a “big yellow bus” bound for Southern 
California, Florida, and ultimately Mexico. 

Yates had been supervising Atkins for a year, and she was surprised by 
her charge’s sudden change in character. True, Atkins had always been 
“flighty,” but she’d also been respectful and polite, and she’d never failed to 
follow the rules. Now she sounded defiant, if also lackadaisical. She didn’t 
seem to understand, or care, that her behavior would land her in prison. 

After that disturbing phone call, Yates wrote to the head office in 
Sacramento to fill them in. “Charlie,” she wrote, not knowing his last name, 
“is in love with all of them and they all love each other.” Yates had told 
Atkins not to leave, but she was “certain she will do as she pleases.” She 
recommended getting Atkins in court to decide whether her probation should 
be revoked. She closed her letter with chillingly prophetic words: “Hopefully, 
she won’t get into further difficulties with Charlie and the other seven girls.” 

The phone call had so worried Yates that she got in touch with another 
probation officer, M. E. Madison, of Oregon, where Atkins had originally 
been sentenced. Madison, who also kept tabs on Atkins, raised an alarm of 
his own. He’d spoken to Atkins, too, and he didn’t like what he heard. “Her 
speech was quite disorganized,” he wrote to his superiors, “and she repeated 
several times... that ‘Love is everything; everything is nothing.’” He told her 
she couldn’t go; she said she was leaving anyway. 

The officers tried to track her down, to no avail. November faded into 
December. Feeling they’d exhausted their options, they wrote to the original 
sentencing judge, George Jones, of Marion County, Oregon, advising that the 
court take action. That was on December 12. Afterward, the paper record 
abruptly stopped. For twenty-three days, there were no more documents, 
memos, or court filings regarding the truant probationer. 

Then, on January 4, 1968, Judge Jones signed an order terminating Susan 


Atkins’s probation. Probation officials in two states had gone so far as to 
warn Atkins that her return to prison was inevitable. Instead, the judge 
rewarded her by releasing her from all obligations to law enforcement. 

As in the later case, there was no record explaining the judge’s decision. 
He knew the nature of her crimes; he knew how serious a threat she could 
become. Why would he have reversed himself? Why would another judge 
have followed suit? Atkins hardly seemed the type to win over two separate 
judges. Only one thing had changed when these reversals occurred: she was 
with Manson. As long as she stayed on his side, it seemed the rules didn’t 


apply. 


Roger Smith, “the Friendly Fed” 


The law afforded special privileges to everyone in Manson’s orbit. Once I 
was absorbed in the Family’s origin story, I found evidence everywhere of a 
curious leniency, always helped along by a hand from the outside. Of special 
note was an incident in June 1968 that earned Atkins her second probation 
sentence, the one that almost—almost—had her off the streets for good 
before the Tate—LaBianca murders. 

It began in the small outpost of Ukiah. As the seat for Mendocino County 
—one of the Family’s favorite getaways—Ukiah by 1968 had become a 
haven for hippies fleeing San Francisco, which was no longer the 
untrammeled paradise it had been a few years before. In Haight-Ashbury, 
speed was now the drug of choice, and with it came violence, con men, 
bikers, dope peddlers, and runaways. Worst were the tourists, who’d started 
to congregate in the Haight to admire the psychedelic memorabilia for sale: 
tie-dyed shirts, MAKE LOVE NOT WAR buttons, beads, baubles, and bell- 
bottoms. 

Mendocino County, 150 miles northwest of the Golden Gate Bridge, was 
an oasis by comparison. Rolling acres of land and dense forests of centuries- 
old redwoods stretched all the way to the sea. Small towns speckled the 
landscape with a patchwork quilt of groves and orchards. Communes had 
sprouted up as early as 1965, but they increased tenfold after the implosion of 
the Haight. In early June 1968, Manson sent his girls there to win some 
recruits for their own commune. 


The delegation of five women—Susan Atkins, Ella Jo Bailey, Patricia 
Krenwinkel, Stephanie Rowe, and Mary Brunner—used a technique that 
they’d refined into an art form. They sought out impressionable young men, 
invited them to an all-girl orgy, and offered them a plethora of narcotics, 
including marijuana quietly spiked with LSD. Unfortunately, that day in 
Ukiah, they snared three underage boys. More unfortunately, one of them 
happened to be the son of a Mendocino County deputy sheriff. 

The seventeen-year-old awoke in a tangle of limbs, extricated himself, and 
darted home, telling his parents that his “legs looked like snakes” and that he 
“saw flashes when he closed his eyes.” Soon all five women had been 
charged with felony drug possession and contributing to the delinquency of 
minors. They were locked up in the Mendocino County jail. 

The outlook was grim for the Manson girls. Two of them were already in 
the probation office’s sights—Atkins had just been released from her 
sentence, and Brunner’s had just begun. But all they had to do was make one 
phone call and they were as good as gone. 


The man they called was Roger Smith, Manson’s parole officer in San 
Francisco. Or rather, his former parole officer. At the time of these arrests, 
Smith had recently left his job, and you’d think he would have severed ties 
with his one remaining parolee: Manson. But the two had grown close. 
Smith, who called Manson “Charlie,” ended up becoming one of the most 
vital figures in my investigation—more than anyone else, he knew how and 
why Manson had formed the Family, because he’d watched it happen. And 
legally, he wielded immense power over Manson. He could’ve sent him back 
to prison at any time. 

Instead, he acted more as Manson’s guardian. Their bond was such that, 
when Manson’s disciples called him from Ukiah that day in June, Smith and 
his wife decided to drive up to Mendocino County to check on them. They 
had no professional obligation to do this. 

Brunner had recently given birth to a son, Michael Valentine, and with the 
girls in jail, the baby had no one to take care of him. (Manson was the father, 
of course; Michael Valentine, sometimes known as “Pooh Bear,” was the 
Family’s first child.) Smith and his wife took an extraordinary step: they got 
the court to appoint them as Pooh Bear’s temporary foster parents, and they 


returned to the Bay Area with the baby, looking after him for eight weeks. 

In the meantime, a friend of Smith named Alan Rose repaired to 
Mendocino County to get the girls out of jail. Rose, a college dropout who 
met the Family through Smith, made a valiant effort. He’d become enamored 
of the girls. He visited them almost daily, hired lawyers for them, and 
testified as a character witness at their preliminary hearings. And finally he 
raised their bail money, winning their freedom until the trial at the end of the 
summer. 

All the while, Manson remained in L.A., ensconced in the comfort of 
Dennis Wilson’s home. He received periodic updates about the girls, but he 
never seemed terribly concerned. Why should he have been? By that time, 
he’d been through enough to know that he was golden: with Roger Smith 
watching over him, crimes had no consequences. 

In the end, charges were dropped against three of the women for lack of 
evidence. Atkins and Brunner pleaded guilty to possessing narcotics. In 
exchange, the charges that they’d furnished drugs to minors were dismissed. 

Then the court shocked the community by granting Atkins probation 
instead of sending her to prison. Brunner was already on probation in L.A., or 
one assumes she would’ve gotten it, too. The sixty days they’d already spent 
in the county jail was apparently punishment enough—they were free. 

As we now know, Atkins would violate her probation in June 1969, 
forcing her to be spirited away from the Family and carted back to 
Mendocino County by police. And her violation wouldn’t matter—the 
beneficent Judge Burke would return her to the fold, no questions asked. 

Once again the pattern held: when it came to women in the orbit of 
Charles Manson, the court was unusually forgiving, ruling against the wishes 
of police and prosecutors. 

I wanted to find the reasons behind the court’s clemency. I called the 
Superior Court in Ukiah and bought the entire file for the Mendocino case, 
including the record of the probation investigations for Atkins and Brunner. 

It turned out that both women had received glowing appraisals and 
impassioned pleas for leniency from none other than Roger Smith. In his 
petitions, Smith identified himself as a “former federal parole officer,” but he 
neglected to mention that his most recent and final parole client was Charles 
Manson—the very man who’d sent Atkins and Brunner to Mendocino in the 
first place. 


If the court knew about Smith’s relationship to Manson, there’s no record 
of it. And the judges weren’t the only ones from whom Smith withheld this 
information. David Mandel, a Mendocino County probation officer who filed 
the sentencing report for Atkins and Brunner, wrote extensively about 
Manson and his “guru”-like hold over the women, and he spoke to Roger 
Smith—without realizing the two were connected. Neither Smith nor his 
wife, who’d also advocated for the girls’ release, ever saw fit to mention their 
relationship with Manson. (Smith’s wife, Carol, who divorced him in 1981, 
denied any involvement in the recommendations, suggesting that Smith had 
used her name without her knowledge.) 

Mandel put a lot of stock in Smith’s word. He was impressed that a 
former federal parole officer would put his weight behind a slouch like 
Atkins, whom he described as “hostile and possibly vengeful.” Smith and his 
wife swore that Atkins would “comply willingly with any probationary 
conditions.” And while Mandel saw Brunner as “much influenced and often 
manipulated by her present group,” the Smiths praised her as an emblem of 
“traditional Christian values.” 

Of course, Smith had spent a long time with the Family by then. He knew 
that Brunner and Atkins had every intention of returning to the man who 
dictated their lives, often inciting them to criminality. And sure enough, when 
the court let them go, they fled Mendocino immediately for the Spahn Ranch, 
where Manson was now situated. 


In 2008, I met with David Mandel in Marin County. I was the first to tell him 
that Roger Smith had been Manson’s parole officer. 

“Of course it should have been disclosed,” said Mandel, poring over the 
documents I’d brought. “It’s a huge conflict of interest!” 

Mandel remembered visiting the Smiths at their home in Tiburon, outside 
San Francisco. He noticed that the couple cared enough for Mary Brunner to 
have petitioned for temporary custody of her child. The couple was a major 
factor in his decision to recommend probation, he said, shaking his head. “I 
should’ve put two and two together.” 

One other strange fact bears mentioning, even though I’ve never known 
what to make of it. Six months after the Ukiah trial, one of the judges, Robert 
Winslow, lost his reelection bid to the bench—in no small part, according to 


one insider, because of his leniency with the Manson girls. Winslow 
resurfaced in Los Angeles. Remarkably, he’d become the attorney for Doris 
Day and her son, Terry Melcher. It was Winslow who prepped Melcher for 
his appearances at the Tate—LaBianca trial, and Winslow who accompanied 
him in the courtroom as he testified, incorrectly, about the number of times 
he’d met Manson. Ironically, Winslow was helping Melcher speak out 
against the same group he’d helped the year before. Neither he nor Melcher 
ever made a public comment about the sheer unlikeliness of it all. 


“A Totally Irresponsible Individual” 


Even before I got the probation records, I was convinced that something was 
off about Roger Smith’s relationship with the Family. My interest in the 
federal officer coincided with my deep dive into COINTELPRO and 
CHAOS, both of which were active in the Bay Area in 1967. 

I wanted to know everything about Smith and Manson. How had Smith 
become Manson’s parole officer? Why were they so close? And what made 
Smith so inclined to treat Manson like a harmless hippie rather than a 
dangerous ex-con? 

The answers came mainly from a pivotal chapter of Manson’s life, one 
that Bugliosi glossed over in Helter Skelter: the summer of love. From the 
late spring of 1967 to June 1968, Manson lived in Haight-Ashbury, the 
hotbed of the counterculture. Given how often Manson is characterized as a 
curdled hippie—a perversion of the principles of free love—you’d think his 
year in the Haight would attract more attention. It was the crucible in which 
his identity was forged. He arrived there an ex-con and left a confident, long- 
haired cult leader. It was in the Haight that he began to use LSD. He learned 
how to attract weak, susceptible people, and how to use drugs to keep them 
under his thumb. And he internalized the psychological methods that would 
make his followers do anything for him. 

This would’ve been all but impossible without Roger Smith. 


The two came together in a roundabout way. Manson had been released from 
Terminal Island prison in Los Angeles County on March 21, 1967. He’d 
served seven and a half years for forging a government check. When he 


stepped out that day, he was thirty-two, and he’d spent nearly half his life in 
prisons and juvenile detention centers. As Bugliosi would marvel in Helter 
Skelter, prison supervisors had largely assessed Manson as nonviolent. 
Though he’d faced juvenile convictions of armed robbery and homosexual 
rape, and had beaten his wife, these didn’t add up, in the eyes of the state, to a 
“sustained history of violence.” Nor, as Bugliosi noted, did they fit the profile 
of a mass murderer in 1969. 

Another peculiarity: all of Manson’s prison time was at the federal level. 
Bugliosi found this startling. “Probably ninety-nine out of one-hundred 
criminals never see the inside of a federal court,” he noted. Manson had been 
described as “criminally sophisticated,” but had he been convicted at the state 
level, he would’ve faced a fraction of the time behind bars—maybe less than 
five years, versus seventeen. 

Within days of his release, Manson violated his parole. Unless he had 
explicit permission, he was supposed to stay put; he was forbidden from 
leaving Los Angeles under penalty of automatic repatriation to prison. But 
practically immediately, he headed to Berkeley, California. 

Years earlier, Manson had had his parole revoked just for failing to report 
to his supervisor. Now, for some reason, the police bureaucracy of an entirely 
different city welcomed him with open arms. When he called up the San 
Francisco Federal Parole Office to announce himself, they simply filed some 
routine paperwork transferring him to the supervision of Roger Smith, an 
officer and a student at UC Berkeley’s School of Criminology. 

Helter Skelter is deeply misleading on this point. Bugliosi writes simply 
that Manson “requested and received permission to go to San Francisco.” The 
prosecutor had a copy of Manson’s parole file, so he knew this wasn’t true. 

I wanted that file, too. After a FOIA request and months of negotiations 
and appeals, I received a portion of it in 2000. It contained a letter from the 
San Francisco parole office to the Los Angeles office, dated April 11, 1967— 
three weeks after Manson’s release. “This man called our San Francisco 
Federal Parole Office to announce that he had been paroled and was now 
within the city of Berkeley, California,” the letter begins. 


He had no parole documents (he impresses as a totally irresponsible 
individual)... the institution at Terminal Island tells us that this man 


was paroled on March 21, 1967, to the Central District of California 
(Los Angeles). Since this man indicates his intention to stay within the 
San Francisco Metropolitan area for the indefinite future we now 
indicate our willingness to accept transfer of supervision to this 
Northern District of California. 


And so began Manson’s assignment to Roger Smith, whom the ex-con came 
to revere. 


As the months passed, Manson granted Smith a special role as “protector” in 
the abstruse mythology he’d begun to construct around himself. The Haight 
had introduced him to Stranger in a Strange Land, Robert Heinlein’s 
provocative 1961 sci-fi novel. Manson was obsessed with the book. He 
carried a worn copy with him at all times, and though he was barely literate, 
he seemed to grasp the nuances of its dense narrative and its invented 
language. 

There’s no saying who might have read the book to him or told him about 
it, but in its hero, Valentine Michael, Manson recognized himself, so much so 
that he named his first child after him. Roger Smith got a nickname from 
Manson, too: “Jubal Harshaw,” the most important character in the hero’s 
life, his lawyer, teacher, protector, and spiritual guide on Earth. 

The plot of Stranger in a Strange Land has eerie parallels to Manson’s 
rise, so much so that, after the murders, fans of the novel went out of their 
way to disavow Manson’s connection to it. Valentine Michael, a human 
raised on Mars, is endowed with hypnotic powers. He descends to Earth to 
foster a new and perfect race. Guarded by Jubal, he assembles a “nest” with 
about twenty others, almost all women, whom he initiates through sex. He 
demands that his followers surrender their egos to him in a spirit of total 
submission. They worship the innocence of children and yearn to exist in a 
state of such pure consciousness that they can communicate telepathically. 
The group sleeps and eats together; one of their most sacred rituals is the act 
of “sharing water,” which takes on vaguely druggy undertones. In Valentine 
Michael’s philosophy, there is no death, only “discorporation”; killing people 
saves their souls, giving them a second chance through reincarnation. The 
group begins to discorporate their enemies with impunity. In time, Valentine 


Michael draws strength from the “nest” and, like Christ, saves the world. 

After the Family was caught, Time magazine picked up on the bizarre 
parallels between Stranger in a Strange Land and Manson’s own “nest.” In 
January 1970, it ran a piece called “A Martian Model?” arguing that Manson 
had “no powers of invention at all... He may have murdered by the book.” 

But Roger Smith approved of Manson’s fascination with the novel. He 
thought it was good that Manson saw his own fantasies in it; there was no 
harm in his desire to become a savior. If that meant that Smith himself took 
on the role of Jubal, so be it. 

When we spoke, Smith was hazy on the details of how he became 
Manson’s parole officer. Manson had been assigned to him as a part of the 
so-called San Francisco Project, an experimental parole program funded by 
the National Institute of Mental Health that monitored the rehabilitative 
progress of newly released felons. When Manson arrived in the Bay Area in 
March 1967, he was attached to the program—and to Roger Smith. 

Manson’s participation in the San Francisco Project has never been 
reported. In part, it explains why the two men had developed such a powerful 
bond—because Smith spent much more time with Manson than the average 
parole officer would. The project studied the relationship between federal 
parolees and their supervisors; researchers wanted to know how varying 
degrees of oversight affected recidivism rates. The six participating parole 
officers, all of whom had advanced degrees in criminology, were assigned 
one of three caseloads: “normal,” averaging about one hundred clients; 
“ideal,” numbering forty clients; or “intensive,” twenty clients. 

Roger Smith fell into the middle group. He met with his clients once a 
week, per project guidelines. But at some point, his “ideal” caseload became 
even more intense than his colleagues’ “intensives.” By the end of ’67, he’d 
winnowed his set of parolees from forty down to just one: Manson. 

I was shocked that Manson had become Smith’s one and only client, but I 
could never figure out why. Hoping to learn more, I interviewed Smith’s 
research assistant from that time, Gail Sadalla. Although Smith had assured 
me that he’d never met Manson before becoming his parole officer, Sadalla 
had a different recollection. Smith told her in 1968 that Manson became his 
charge because he’d already been his probation officer years earlier—in the 
early sixties, at the Joliet Federal Prison in Illinois. Admittedly, this seemed 
all but impossible. Manson had never been in the Illinois parole system, and 


he’d only been incarcerated in the state for a few days in 1956. But Sadalla 
was convinced that the two had met previously. When I told her that her 
former boss had no memory of meeting Manson before March 1967, she was 
stunned. 

“He didn’t remember that?” she asked. “I’m surprised... It was always my 
understanding. That’s why there was this connection.” 

I didn’t know what to believe, but if Sadalla was correct, it might explain 
how Manson was able to move to San Francisco without being sent back to 
prison for violating the terms of his parole: he may have been sent there. 


“Wipe Your Eyes and See” 


As a doctoral student at the Berkeley School of Criminology, Roger Smith 
studied the link between drug use and violent behavior in Oakland gang 
members. In April 1967, the study had seen enough success to merit a press 
conference. As the New York Times reported, Smith and his colleagues had 
found that a gang’s drug use, rather than “mellowing them out,” more often 
triggered violent behavior. The students wanted to distinguish between gang 
members who fell into violence because of inherent sociopathic tendencies 
and those who became sociopathic because of drugs. 

Smith conducted research through his own “immersion.” He and the other 
researchers created “outposts” in the Oakland slums, hanging around at 
community centers and churches, befriending gang members under less-than- 
transparent circumstances. They embraced a “participant-observer” approach 
to social research, which Smith would further incorporate into his methods in 
the years to come. 

By 1967, Smith was regarded as an expert on gangs, collective behavior, 
violence, and drugs. Manson, his one and only parole supervisee, would go 
on to control the collective behavior of a gang through violence and drugs. 

Smith described himself to me as a “rock-ribbed Republican”—he never 
struck me as someone with much tolerance for the counterculture. And yet it 
was his idea, he admitted, to send Manson to live in the Haight. He hoped 
that Manson could “soak up” some of the “vibes” of the peace and love 
movement exploding in the district that summer. Maybe it would allay some 
of Manson’s hostility. 


So Manson moved from Berkeley to Haight-Ashbury, crashing wherever 
he could and never paying rent. The hippie movement was nearing its high 
point. Bohemians were dispensing with boundaries, giving away clothes, 
drugs, sex, music, and hours of talk about tolerance. Anarchists called for the 
end of racism, capitalism, and imperialism; the mere act of picking up a 
guitar had a new ideological voltage. The length of your hair said everything 
about you. Drawn by the psychedelic aesthetic, teens flocked from around the 
country to get laid, to try to bring enduring peace to the world, or to try pot 
and LSD, the latter of which had only recently been made illegal in 
California. 

It was a concerted, grassroots effort to reject middle-class morality. But 
where some saw earthshaking radicalism, others saw only Dionysian excess. 
George Harrison, of Manson’s life-defining band, the Beatles, stopped by the 
Haight that summer and came away unimpressed: “The summer of love was 
just a bunch of spotty kids on drugs,” he said. A press release for the Human 
Be-In, a sprawling gathering a few months before Manson came to town, 
gives a sense of the era’s transformative rhetoric: “A new nation has grown 
inside the robot flesh of the old... Hang your fear at the door and join the 
future. If you do not believe, please wipe your eyes and see.” 

When Manson went to wipe his eyes and see, he wasted no time adopting 
the folkways and postures of the flower children. Once he landed in the 
Haight, he dropped acid on a daily basis. It took just one trip to foment the 
most abrupt change that Roger Smith had ever witnessed in one of his 
charges. Manson “seemed to accept the world” after LSD, Smith wrote. 
Seemingly overnight, he transformed himself into an archetypal hippie, his 
worldview suddenly inflected with spiritualism. He grew out his hair and 
played guitar in the street, panhandling and scrounging for food. Although 
only in his early thirties, he presented himself as a father figure, attracting 
young, down-and-out men and women as they embarked on the spiritual 
quest that had led them to the Haight. 

If Manson was eager to portray himself as Jesus, then Roger Smith 
would’ve been John. According to one of my sources, no one knew Manson 
better than his parole officer did. It would be surprising if Smith didn’t know 
that his ward was breaking the law—a lot. But he had only praise for his sole 
client. “Mr. Manson has made excellent progress,” he wrote in one of several 
reports he made to the head parole office in Washington, D.C. “He appears to 


be in better shape personally than he has been in a long time.” 

Smith wrote those words on July 31, 1967. At the time, Manson was 
sitting in a jail cell. A few days earlier, in Ukiah, he’d been convicted of 
interfering with a police officer in the line of duty—a felony. He’d been 
trying to prevent the arrest of Ruth Ann Moorehouse, aka Ouisch, one of his 
newly recruited underage girls. Though the charge was reduced to a 
misdemeanor, Manson was given a thirty-day suspended sentence and three 
years’ probation. (The arrest merited only a footnote in Helter Skelter—and 
Bugliosi didn’t say that it resulted in a conviction.) Instead of being sent back 
to prison, Manson, who’d been out for only four months then, was back on 
the streets again in a few days. 


That incident continued the distressing pattern of amnesty that Roger Smith 
could never explain. In part, Smith benefited, and continues to benefit, from a 
veil of secrecy. Manson’s complete parole file has never been released. It 
wasn’t even permitted into evidence during the trial. During the death-penalty 
phase, the defense’s Irving Kanarek had subpoenaed the file, hoping he could 
use some part of it to argue for his client’s life. Not only did the United States 
Attorney General, John Mitchell, refuse to release it, he dispatched David 
Anderson, an official from the Justice Department, to aid Bugliosi in his 
effort to quash the subpoena. It was an almost unprecedented action. During 
death-penalty arguments, when a defendant’s life hangs in the balance, 
anything that could be introduced to save that life is routinely allowed into 
evidence. In the courtroom, stunned that the government wouldn’t allow 
Manson access to his own file, Kanarek asked Anderson if it contained 
information that would “incriminate the Attorney General.” Bugliosi 
objected; the judge sustained, and Anderson didn’t have to answer. 
Ultimately, the judge upheld the prosecution’s motion to quash the subpoena. 
The file was never allowed into evidence, and the whole episode was 
excluded from Helter Skelter. 

The fifty-five parole documents turned over to me (later sixty-nine, after 
exhaustive FOIA appeals) by the federal Parole Commission represent only a 
sliver of Manson’s total file, which was described as “four inches thick” at 
his trial. Still, those pages have enough raw data to show that during 
Manson’s first fourteen months of freedom in San Francisco—months during 


which he attracted the followers that became the Family—he was given 
virtual immunity from parole revocation by Roger Smith. Under Smith’s 
supervision, Manson was repeatedly arrested and even convicted without 
ever being sent back to prison. It was up to Smith to revoke Manson’s parole 
—it was ultimately his decision. But he never even reported any of his 
client’s violations to his supervisors. 

In interviews with me, Smith claimed not to have known about Manson’s 
conviction in Ukiah, even though it had occurred under his watch. In fact, in 
the same July 1967 letter that should have mentioned Manson’s conviction— 
the letter that lauded his “excellent progress’—Smith requested permission 
for Manson to travel to Mexico, where he would’ve been totally 
unsupervised, for a gig with a hotel band. (Smith failed to note the fact that 
Manson had been arrested in Mexico in 1959, resulting in his deportation to 
the United States and the revocation of his federal probation.) 

“Manson is not to leave the Northern District of California,” the parole 
board responded, noting that Manson’s “history does not mention any 
employment as musician,” and that his record was “lengthy and serious.” 

And yet, two weeks later, Smith tried again—he really wanted to send 
Manson to Mexico. He told the parole board that Manson had been offered a 
second job there by “a general distributor for the Perma-Guard Corporation 
of Phoenix Arizona named Mr. Dean Moorehouse,” who wanted Manson to 
survey “the market for insecticides, soil additives and mineral food 
supplements.” Smith neglected to mention that Moorehouse was on probation 
—regulations barred associations between parolees and probationers—and 
one of Manson’s newest recruits, the father of the fifteen-year-old whose 
arrest Manson had tried to prevent three weeks earlier. 

The parole board rejected this second request, too. Interestingly, at the 
same time Smith made these requests, he’d launched a criminological study 
of Mexican drug trafficking for the federal government. He’d attempted to 
send Manson to Mazatlan, which was the main port city of Sinaloa, the drug 
trafficking capital of Central America in the 1960s. 

“In hindsight,” Smith told me when I presented him with the documents, 
“it was not a good decision.” Then he reversed course a bit, saying that he 
probably made the requests “just to show Manson they wouldn’t let him go.” 

“But, twice?” I asked. “And at the expense of your own credibility?” 

He erupted. “If you want to be conspiratorial,” he said, “yes, I was doing 


research on Mexican drug trafficking at the same time I was trying to send 
him there. So, yes, you could make it look like that, but that wasn’t what it 
was. I wasn’t a career PO. I only did it for a couple of years because I needed 
the money while I did my dissertation. My wife was a teacher, but we had no 
money. Was I a career, committed parole officer? No!” 


Committed or not, Smith had official responsibilities—and the paper trail, in 
its sparseness, suggests that these didn’t much weigh on him. After those two 
Mexico requests, Smith generated only two more documents regarding 
Manson for another five months. Both were simple form letters authorizing 
Manson to travel to Florida to meet with “recording agents.” 

Those interested me for several reasons. First, they violated Smith’s 
orders from Washington—he was to forbid Manson from leaving the 
Northern District of California under any circumstances. Second, Smith had 
postdated them, suggesting that he wrote them after Manson had already left 
town, safeguarding him from another potential violation. And third, there’s 
no sign that Manson and the Family ever actually went to Florida. If they 
went anywhere, the only available evidence suggests, it was to Mexico. 

Smith’s letters are from November 1967. On the very day that Susan 
Atkins’s probation officers were frantically trying to prevent her from 
traveling, she, Manson, and the others were pulling out of San Francisco in 
their big yellow bus with permission from Roger Smith. 

Manson was required to send postcards to Smith; there’s no record that he 
did. Later, probation reports noted that Atkins and Mary Brunner had said 
they spent quite a bit of time in Mexico with Manson that winter. Otherwise, 
their whereabouts for November and December 1967 are entirely 
unaccounted for. 


Fourteen Naked Hippies in a Ditch 


After the Florida letters, the record of Manson’s supervision stops for another 
five months—a period during which Manson reported to Smith on a weekly 
and sometimes daily basis, as he turned his soul-searching followers into 
programmed killers and planned for a race war. 

There should be an avalanche of paperwork on Manson from this time. 


While certainly Smith wrote reports, the Parole Commission released only 
twelve documents from his fourteen-month supervision. The Los Angeles 
portion of Manson’s file—covering approximately May 1968 to October 
1969—is nearly as incomplete, with sixteen letters from agency officials and 
Samuel Barrett, who succeeded Smith as Manson’s parole officer. 

As few as they are, those letters depict an unmanageable parolee at odds 
with the “excellent progress” described by Smith a year earlier. Barrett once 
wrote to Manson, “Considering the nature of your last two arrests, and the 
suspicion you have aroused with law enforcement in this district, the 
reflection of your status leaves much to be desired.” 

Despite this admonishment, Barrett was the parole officer Bugliosi 
singled out for blame at the trial and in Helter Skelter. Not Smith, the foster 
parent to Manson’s baby; not Smith, the proud possessor of an affectionate 
nickname from Manson; not Smith, the parole officer who praised Manson’s 
“progress” three days after he was criminally convicted. By smearing Barrett, 
Bugliosi diverted attention from Smith’s far graver sins. After all, where 
Smith’s caseload had dwindled from forty to just one, Barrett had between 
two hundred fifty and three hundred parole cases between 1967 and 1969. 
But in Helter Skelter’s more than seven hundred pages, Bugliosi could spare 
only twenty-one words for Roger Smith, whom he never called to testify at 
trial. Smith told me that he was never questioned about Manson by Bugliosi, 
the police, or any federal agency—ever. 

I knew there had to be more papers from Smith’s time as Manson’s parole 
officer. Remember, under oath at the trial, Barrett had described Manson’s 
parole file as “about four inches thick.” I asked the Parole Commission 
spokesperson, Pamela A. Posch, how it could have been reduced to what I’d 
been told was only 138 pages, and why I could see only 69 of these, 
extensively redacted. The Bureau of Prisons “apparently did not retain all of 
the parole documents pertaining to Mr. Manson,” Posch wrote, conceding 
that this was unusual. The bureau had a policy to preserve the files of 
“notorious felons” for history’s sake. Manson was about as notorious as a 
felon could be. 

I thought I’d exhausted my options, but then I remembered that Smith and 
Manson were part of the San Francisco Project. Since it was a federal study 
funded by NIMH, it would have required even closer scrutiny of Manson’s 
activities; according to Smith, its clients were to be tracked, analyzed, and 


recorded in a separate file. But it practically goes without saying: that file was 
missing, too. 


If Smith maintained a close record of Manson, he kept a lot of people in the 
dark, including his own colleagues. He provided so few details that the parole 
offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco didn’t even know where Manson 
was living. 

In April 1968, Smith’s carelessness blew up in his face when, yet again, 
Manson was arrested. And there was no covering it up this time—too many 
papers had gotten the story. When Smith’s colleagues at the parole office 
read about it, they flipped out and tried to do what Smith hadn’t: send 
Manson back to prison. 

The headline in the Los Angeles Times read, “Wayward Bus Stuck in 
Ditch: Deputy Finds Nude Hippies Asleep in Weeds.” Other papers picked 
up the news, too. Their articles were the first to describe what the world 
would soon know as the Manson Family. 

The Times staff writer Charles Hillinger described an Oxnard deputy on a 
late-night patrol who stumbled on a broken-down bus in a ditch by the Pacific 
Coast Highway. When he saw the bodies scattered in the weeds—nine 
women, five men—he thought they were dead. Then he realized they were 
only sleeping. After running a check on the bus’s tags, he learned it had been 
reported stolen from Haight-Ashbury. Waking the group, he told them to get 
dressed and wait for the county bus he’d ordered, which would take them all 
to jail. Before they left, one of the women (later identified as Mary Brunner) 
said, “Wait, my baby’s on the bus.” She went back to pick up her child, then 
only a week old. He was sick, with grime and open sores all over his body. 

The article identified the “self-proclaimed leader of the band of 
wanderers” as Charles Manson, adding that he was booked on suspicion of 
grand theft. Brunner was charged with endangering the life of a child. She 
was later convicted and received two years’ probation. 

Within several days, the chief of the San Francisco probation office, 
Albert Wahl, was alerted to an article about the arrest in the Oakland 
Tribune: “14 Nude Hippies Found Beside Wayward Bus.” Of course, one of 
those hippies was a parolee under his office’s supervision. 

Wahl flew into a rage, writing to his counterpart in Los Angeles, Angus 


McEachen, for assistance in finding Manson and sending him back to San 
Francisco. Wahl had to admit, embarrassingly, that his office’s file on 
Manson was “incomplete,” but “apparently” he had been traveling “freely 
between San Francisco and Los Angeles” for months. Wahl didn’t know if 
Manson had permission to travel, but one thing was clear, he added in a 
moment of supreme understatement: “regulations weren’t followed.” Smith’s 
name didn’t come up in the letter, but surely Wahl had him in mind when he 
wrote, “The officer who was handling the case is no longer attached to this 
office.” 

Wahl also wrote of two more arrests in McEachen’s district, noting that 
Manson had failed to report them, as required. For good measure, he sent a 
copy of his letter to the head of the national office in Washington, adding a 
copy of the Tribune story and a handwritten note: “Be sure to read the 
clipping—there are people like this.” 


“You Have Nothing More Important to Do” 


So far, the “people like this” had yet to suffer any consequences for their 
actions. Having been found the legal owner of the bus, Manson spent one day 
in jail. Then he was released, along with the rest of the group. 

McEachen, the chief of the Los Angeles probation office, was not happy 
about this. He had something of a personal stake in Manson’s fate. All the 
way back in May 1960, he’d been the one to violate Manson’s probation for 
failing to report to his supervisor, sending Manson back to federal prison. He 
had every intention of following a similar course this time—but he soon 
learned that, while Manson’s probation had been easy to violate in 1960, 
things were different now. 

In a letter to Wahl, McEachen said that Manson had “personally appeared 
in our office to bring us up-to-date on his adventuresome nature.” Claiming 
to have no interest in money or work—“he has over 3,000 friends who are 
willing to give him any needed assistance”—Manson said that he owned the 
school bus and that he and his “girls” had been traveling between San 
Francisco and Los Angeles in it for months. If anyone from the probation 
office needed to contact him, he could be reached through a “friend named 
Gary Hinman of Topanga Canyon”—the same Hinman whom the Family 


would murder about a year later. 

Manson had gall, but McEachen thought he’d gained the upper hand— 
because Manson had since been arrested again, this time on a drug charge. 
Apparently he was at that moment sitting in the Los Angeles County jail 
awaiting arraignment. 

Sadly, McEachen was wrong: Manson had been released the previous 
day. For unknown reasons, the DA had declined to file charges. Not to be 
deterred, McEachen and Wahl tried to rein in their wandering, lawbreaking 
parolee. As the highest-ranking figures in their offices, they had a lot of clout 
—but not enough to catch Manson. 

Wahl’s most vigorous attempt came on June 3, 1968, when he sent a stern 
ultimatum to Manson’s last two known addresses in San Francisco and Los 
Angeles. (The latter belonged to Dennis Wilson.) Because Wahl didn’t know 
Manson’s exact whereabouts, he was forced to give him two options: report 
to the U.S. probation office in either city immediately. “Failure to follow this 
direction,” he wrote, “will result in my recommending that a warrant for 
mandatory release violation be issued”: 


From this point on, you are not to leave your current residence without 
written permission from a U.S. Probation Officer. Any permission 
given you by Mr. Smith, who is no longer connected with this Service, 
is hereby canceled. Give this matter your immediate attention. You 
have nothing more important to do. 


Manson defied the orders. Rather than showing up in person, he made a 
phone call to Wahl, who was out of the office—and furious to learn, in a 
message taken by a subordinate, that Manson had said he was living at 
Dennis Wilson’s place and had been offered a $20,000 annual recording 
contract by the Beach Boys’ label. As Wahl later wrote to McEachen, “It 
would appear that Mr. Manson is on another LSD trip.” 

Still, at least they knew where Manson was living now. That was a step in 
the right direction, wasn’t it? On June 6, they sent Samuel Barrett, his new 
parole officer, to make an unannounced visit. As Barrett reported back, 
“Manson and some of his hippie followers, mostly female,” had “found a 
haven” at Wilson’s home; “apparently [Wilson] has succumbed to Manson’s 


obsequious manner.” 

Just how deeply had Wilson “succumbed,” though? Could it really be true 
that their delinquent parolee had sweet-talked a Beach Boy into giving him a 
record deal? McEachen must’ve been relieved to hear from Nick Grillo, the 
Beach Boys’ manager. Requesting anonymity, Grillo complained that 
“Manson and his followers are proving to be a threatening factor to the music 
company.” The record label “would have to be idiotic” to have signed him. 

The parole office decided they had to order Manson back to San 
Francisco, making it clear that he’d return to prison if he failed to comply. On 
June 12, Barrett sent a letter giving him twelve days to return. 

Someone must have intervened. There’s no record of what happened 
between June 12 and the June 24 deadline, but apparently that deadline 
evaporated. The next letters came in late July and early August. Making no 
mention of the skipped deadline, McEachen reported to Washington, D.C., 
that he’d received a phone call from Manson, who had moved on to the 
Spahn Ranch, where he was “receiving free room and board in exchange for 
his work as a ranch hand.” By then, someone above Wahl, McEachen, and 
Barrett must’ve decided that it was best to just let Manson be. 

Manson built the Family right under his federal supervisors’ noses. From 
then on, the federal government, as well as local and state law enforcement, 
only backed further away from the group as they more brazenly broke the 
law. 

The only one who didn’t was Roger Smith. Well after his supervision of 
Manson ended, he was still writing letters to the Mendocino County court 
about Atkins’s and Brunner’s sterling characters, and he was caring for 
Manson’s son. Smith and his wife even hosted Manson at their home. With 
all I’d learned, I still couldn’t grasp how a “rock-ribbed Republican” would 
fall in with an aspirant hippie like Manson—and why their friendship 
persisted beyond the dissolution of their official relationship. 


Coda: The Speed Scene 


Smith may have had ulterior motives when he told Manson to move to 
Haight-Ashbury. As part of his criminology research, he’d been tapped to 
lead a study on amphetamines and their role in the violent behavior of 


Haight-Ashbury hippies. The National Institute of Mental Health funded this 
study, as they had the San Francisco Project. In 1976, a FOIA request forced 
NIMH to acknowledge that it had allowed itself to be used by the CIA as a 
funding front in the sixties. 

Smith hoped to learn why some people, but not others, became 
psychotically violent on amphetamines—and to see if this violence could be 
controlled. The goals of the Amphetamine Research Project (ARP), as he 
dubbed it, were to “illuminate three major areas” of the “speed scene” in the 
Haight: the “individual” experience, the “collective or group experience,” and 
the “way in which violence is generated within the speed marketplace.” 
Smith studied hippie collectives by observing them in their daily routines, 
and he enjoined his researchers to participate, too. He later recalled that when 
he was appointed to lead the study, “[I] took off my gray-flannel suit and my 
wing-tip shoes and grew a moustache. Soon the kids on Haight Street were 
calling me the Friendly Fed and asking me to help them with the law.” 

There’s no indication that his technique proved useful—because there’s 
not much indication that the ARP ever happened at all. Smith never published 
his research. Two papers about the ARP were scheduled to appear in the 
Journal of Psychedelic Drugs, but they never materialized. The closest thing 
to a record of the ARP is Smith’s unpublished dissertation, submitted to 
Berkeley a month before the Manson murders. Even this, however, contains 
no actual “participation-observation” data—it is mainly secondhand 
anecdotes and statistical analysis. 

But the paper, “The Marketplace of Speed: Violence and Compulsive 
Methamphetamine Abuse,” does describe the nature of participant- 
observation, which, Smith wrote, forced a social scientist to break the law. 
Hiding in a “deviant group,” he had to convince drug users 


that they can trust him with information which, in other hands, would 
place them in jeopardy, and perhaps most important, he must resolve 
the moral dilemma of being part of something which he may find 
morally objectionable (at best), probably by association he could 
himself be arrested... in a very real sense, he becomes a co- 
conspirator... with information and insight which under normal 
conditions the average citizen would be obliged to share with law 


enforcement... he must try to understand what individuals within the 
group feel, how they view the “straight” world, how they avoid arrest 
or detection... 


To ensure success, Smith argued, researchers had to protect their subjects 
from criminal prosecution, concealing their activities from the police and 
granting them anonymity in all reports. The ARP, then, had something 
resembling police immunity baked into its very mission. 

Smith ran the ARP out of the Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic 
(HAFMC), which had just opened the previous summer. Soon, he was 
spending so much time there that he made a proposition to his only parole 
client: instead of meeting with Manson in downtown San Francisco, where 
Smith had an office, why not just meet at the clinic? It was more convenient 
for both of them, and anyway, by that time Manson and “his girls” had 
started to contract sexually transmitted diseases; the clinic could treat those 
for free. 

Soon Manson became a mainstay at the HAFMC. Between visiting Smith 
and receiving medical care, there were some weeks when he appeared at the 
clinic every day. He became a familiar presence to a number of the doctors 
there, including several who, like Smith, had received federal funds to 
research drug use among hippies. 

Smith got the ARP off the ground at the same time he was supervising 
Manson for the San Francisco Project. It was during this overlap that the 
record of Manson’s parole supervision was either spotty, nonexistent, or later 
expunged. This funny, scruffy little visitor to the clinic, always with his 
retinue of girls, was taking a ton of drugs and forming the Family. By the 
time he and his followers turned up in that ditch by the side of the Pacific 
Coast Highway in April 1968, the girls had traded the flowers in their hair for 
steel knives, sheathed in leather and strapped to their thighs beneath long 
flowing dresses. I was convinced that Roger Smith had played some part in 
this transformation; now I began to wonder whether the HAFMC, with its 
emphasis on hippies, drugs, and research, had some role, too.

The Haight-Ashbury Free Medical 
Clinic 


Too Many Smiths 


To tell the story of Manson properly, as I’d argue Bugliosi never did, you’ve 
got to familiarize yourself with a dauntingly large cast, as is clear by now. 
When I was preparing to turn my aborted Premiere story into a book, I 
realized just how frustrating it was to keep everyone straight, to tell the 
narrative in a way that gave its major players their due without getting mired 
in details. Because, in a sense, the details were everything. The lacunae and 
silences and seemingly irrelevant detours in Manson’s life made it clear that 
he was far more a product of his times, and his surroundings, than something 
as outrageous as the Helter Skelter motive would have you believe. That 
motive makes it seem like Manson and the Family lived in a vacuum. But 
during their formative year in San Francisco, by most accounts, they were 
part of the zeitgeist. To understand that zeitgeist, I had to deal with the sheer 
proliferation of names: hundreds and hundreds of names. 

It’s a confusing story to tell because it involves two Smiths, and they ran 
in the same circles—both were drug researchers with a sociological interest 
in the Haight-Ashbury youth scene. On top of Roger Smith, Manson’s parole 
officer, there was David Smith, no relation, the charismatic creator of the 
Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic. 

You wouldn’t think that Manson, a chary ex-con who disdained 
conventional power structures, would spend a lot of time at a government- 


funded clinic, no matter how groovy its trappings. But Manson and the girls 
were at the HAFMC a lot. When they moved from the disused school bus 
into a proper apartment, he chose one right around the corner from the clinic. 
His involvement with the place, and the extent to which it dovetails with both 
of the Smiths, has been serially unexplored in popular writing on him. 
Because Bugliosi seemed to have no use for the Smiths, no one else did, 
either. But having seen how crucial Roger was to Manson’s development, I 
knew I had to dive into David’s history, too. 


Dr. Dave 


David Elvin Smith grew up in the dusty farm community of Bakersfield, 
California, at the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley. When he moved to 
the Bay Area in 1960 to study at UC Berkeley, Smith was, by his own 
admission, a hick. He’d never traveled much beyond his backwoods town, 
and he lacked the political and intellectual curiosity that animated Berkeley’s 
sophisticated, international student body. Had it not been for his pushy peers, 
always scolding him for missing their sit-ins and marches, Smith probably 
wouldn’t have noticed the dawn of the Free Speech movement on his own 
campus. Later, he liked to remember a teaching assistant who canceled class 
so he and the other students could head to a protest downtown. Smith refused 
to join. He wanted to study for an upcoming test. The TA told him he’d never 
get an A if he didn’t go. 

Smith has been open about his louche behavior in this period: an 
inveterate womanizer and a binge drinker, he disappeared for days at a time 
on benders, nevertheless graduating at the top of his class. At the end of 
1965, a debilitating blackout and a messy breakup led him to give up alcohol. 
By then, Smith, a raffish, good-looking man of twenty-six, was a postdoctoral 
student at UC San Francisco and the chief of the Alcohol and Drug Abuse 
Screening Unit at San Francisco General Hospital. Later he remembered his 
curiosity flaring as his research collided with the city’s cultural upheaval. “I 
was injecting white rats with LSD in the lab,” he said, “and then I’d walk 
home past the Haight, where I’d see kids who were high on the same 
substance.” 

He began to experiment with psychedelics himself, and he liked them. 


The lifestyle brought new friends and new politics. He and his friends tracked 
the burgeoning counterculture in the Haight, where some were predicting an 
influx of 100,000 young people in the coming year. Smith, who felt that 
health care was a right, wondered where the newcomers would receive 
medical attention, and how they would afford it. He moved to Haight- 
Ashbury himself with plans to found a free clinic. 

When it opened at 558 Clayton Street in June 1967, the Haight-Ashbury 
Free Medical Clinic (HAFMC) was an immediate sensation. Staffed entirely 
by volunteers and unauthorized by the city health department, it treated 
hundreds of patients a day, offering nonjudgmental care for those suffering 
from bad trips, overdoses, sexually transmitted diseases, and 
malnourishment, or for those who just needed a kind ear. Lines at the 
HAFMC sometimes stretched around the block with hippies waiting to 
ascend the creaky wooden stairs to its second-floor office. Inside, loitering 
was encouraged. The clinic did everything it could to advertise its 
psychedelic affinities. Exam rooms were painted in aqua and Day-Glo 
orange; one of them was wallpapered with a vibrant collage of peace signs, 
naked bodies, and hypnotic swirls. Even as Smith struggled to pay the rent 
and keep the cops at bay, he reveled in his creation. Few things so perfectly 
encapsulated the utopian ideals of the summer of love. 

As faces filed in and out of the clinic that summer, Smith and his 
colleagues befriended the repeat visitors, and the HAFMC became a scene 
within a scene. It could be hard to tell the hippies apart, with their long, 
beflowered hair, their upstart communes, their shifting legions of followers 
and leaders. But decades later, no one at the clinic had any trouble 
remembering Charlie Manson and his girls. 


Negate Your Ego 


In 1971, David Smith published Love Needs Care, a memoir of the 
HAFMC’s germinal years. I found it rife with details about Manson and the 
Family, and about the very period that Bugliosi had omitted from Helter 
Skelter: the summer of love, when Manson, apparently at his most 
charismatic, began to attract followers and ensure their unconditional 
devotion. Better still, Love Needs Care had a few contributions from Roger 


Smith, offering his own appraisal of Manson. 

As invaluable as these portraits are, though, I called them into question 
when my reporting led me to doubt both of the Smiths. The more I reread 
certain passages, the more they seemed like gingerly public-relations efforts. 
The Smiths had to make it clear that they knew Manson well, and that they’d 
felt some sympathy toward him—there could be no denying that, given how 
often they’d been seen together. But the book came two years after the 
murders, when both men had an interest in distancing themselves from that 
Manson, the murderous one, the metaphor for evil. Love Needs Care attempts 
the delicate task of elucidating the Smiths’ relationships to Manson while 
making it seem as if they had no idea that he and his followers would 
someday erupt into unconscionable violence. 

David Smith described the Family’s frequent trips to the HAFMC, where 
“Charlie’s girls,” as they were known around the halls, were treated for 
sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies. The girls tended to 
Manson’s every need, never speaking unless spoken to. They referred to him 
as Christ, or “J.C.” 

When the Family moved to an apartment on Cole Street, Manson began in 
earnest to “reprogram” his followers. David had an elaborate sense of 
Manson’s tactics, although he never explained where he got it. Using a 
combination of LSD and mind games, Manson forced his followers to submit 
to “unconventional sexual practices,” Smith wrote; he would invoke 
mysticism and pop psychology as the acid took hold, saying, “You have to 
negate your ego.” Treating the girls “like objects,” he eroded their 
independence, turning them “into self-acknowledged ‘computers,’ empty 
vessels that would accept almost anything he poured in.” Before long, they 
obeyed him unquestioningly. 

Acid was unmistakably essential to the process. Manson’s insistence on it 
sometimes put him at odds with trends in the Haight, David thought. 
Typically, hippies who dropped a lot of acid eventually moved on to speed. A 
schism grew in the scene. The “acid heads” (a phrase David claims to have 
coined) favored nonviolence, whereas the “speed freaks” (ditto) caused the 
rash of violence that destroyed the Haight’s live-and-let-live ethos. But 
Manson had an aversion to needles; he wouldn’t use amphetamines. The 
Family’s drug pattern was effectively reversed, with Manson urging his 
disciples to relinquish speed and embrace acid. Weaning his recruits from 


amphetamines reduced the chance of interference with his induction process. 

Speed became a part of the Family’s lifestyle only later, David told me, 
when it came time to kill in Los Angeles. He’d heard this from Susan Atkins 
herself, when she asked him to assess her mental health for a parole hearing 
in 1978. “When they went to the south, they got very deeply involved in 
speed,” he said. They got it from the Hells Angels. “They were trading sex 
for speed, and [Atkins] thinks that Helter Skelter and the ultimate crime was a 
paranoid speed delusion.” 

Bugliosi kept any mention of the Family’s speed use out of the trial. 
David thought he understood why—it risked presenting “mitigating 
circumstances” for the prosecution. And the defense wouldn’t want it coming 
up, either; no one wants his or her clients to look like addicts. 

Both the Smiths have said that Manson’s fear of needles made speed a 
nonissue, but obviously speed can be taken orally or snorted. Over the years, 
a smattering of evidence and firsthand recollections has suggested that the 
Family used amphetamines more often than was suggested at the time. In a 
2009 documentary, Linda Kasabian claimed that she and her companions 
each swallowed a “capsule” of speed before leaving for Cielo Drive on the 
night of Sharon Tate’s murder. (At the trial, she testified that she hadn’t taken 
any drugs around the time of the murders.) In books and at parole hearings, 
Susan Atkins also later copped to taking speed before the Tate murders. Tex 
Watson wrote that he frequently snorted it with the group, and that he, too, 
took it on both nights of the murders. Others added that the Family kept an 
abundance of speed at the Spahn Ranch toward the end of their time there, 
and that Manson himself wasn’t above taking it, especially as he grew more 
paranoid. He would use it to stay up for days at a time, brooding on his 
delusions. 


Remember, Manson lived in the Haight because Roger Smith sent him there, 
thinking its “vibes” would assuage the ex-con’s hostility. And make no 
mistake: Roger did believe that Manson was hostile. In a short essay for Life 
magazine published months after the murders, Roger offered his first-ever 
insights about Manson. (“He speaks of Manson here out of his extensive 
unofficial contact with him,” the magazine noted, without describing the 
nature of that contact or any potential conflict with Smith’s parole duties.) 


“Charlie was the most hostile parolee I’ve ever come across,” Roger wrote. 
“He told me right off there was no way he could keep the terms of his parole. 
He was headed back to the joint and there was no way out of it.” 

Roger would seldom write or speak about Manson again, wanting to 
distance himself from his most infamous client; when I first spoke to him, in 
2001, I was only the third reporter to do so. But his remark about Manson’s 
hostility always stayed with me. I’d already seen, after all, how he’d 
characterized Manson in official parole documents as a well-behaved guy 
making “excellent progress.” The disparity suggested that Roger had been 
willing to sweep Manson’s “hostility” under the rug. 

In a passage he contributed to Love Needs Care, Roger did his best to 
support the idea that the bizarreries of the Haight suited an ex-con like 
Manson. Daily LSD trips made him mellower, more thoughtful. He still had 
the slick duplicitousness of a con man, and he was still a master manipulator, 
but he was suddenly fond of vacuous self-help bromides like “If you love 
everything, you don’t need to think about what bothers you.” 

Roger Smith couldn’t seem too credulous, so he made sure to note the 
“messianic” tilt of Manson’s acid days—an oblique acknowledgment of 
Charlie’s growing megalomania. David Smith mirrored the sentiment, 
writing that Manson’s LSD trips replaced his “underlying depression with a 
manic smile” that sometimes betrayed darker philosophies. David admitted 
that Manson “began to develop a number of delusions as his involvement 
with LSD progressed.” He fantasized about the Beatles ordaining him their 
musical equal; he imagined a Judgment Day when blacks would slaughter 
whites. 

Some of Roger’s familiars, including his wife, couldn’t understand his 
affinity for Manson. Roger was “pretty much in awe of Charlie’s ability to 
draw these women to him,” one said. Another thought that he “was always 
kind of fascinated” with “the charming charismatic sociopath.” 

After Manson’s role in the Tate-LaBianca murders came out, Roger 
allowed that “he had made an error” in bringing him to the Haight. But at the 
time, the Family enjoyed a remarkable kinship with Roger. They “swarmed 
over [Roger] Smith and often filled the [clinic] reception room,” David Smith 
wrote, “bringing operations to a standstill.” Roger didn’t mind the adulation, 
in part, David claimed, because “Charlie frequently offered him the services 
of his harem.” (Roger declined this offer.) 


Among the HAFMC alumni I spoke to, the understanding was Manson 
had visited the clinic on many occasions to see Roger for their mandatory 
parole meetings. Roger himself would later claim that the Family simply 
came by out of the blue, for no particular reason, and that they didn’t begin 
seeing him there until after his duties as Manson’s parole officer had ended. 
In either case, something about the arrangement didn’t sit well with me. One 
reason the HAFMC was free, after all, was that David, Roger, and their 
colleagues had received private and federal grants to conduct drug research 
there. The Smiths were both studying amphetamines and LSD, the latter 
being the crucial component in Manson’s “reprogramming” process. How 
had an uneducated ex-con—someone who, months ago, had never taken acid 
and maybe never even heard of it—come to use the drug to such 
sophisticated ends? And wasn’t it suspicious, at least, that he was coming to 
the HAFMC to see two people who were studying that very phenomenon, the 
use of drugs to control and change behavior? 

At least one friend of Roger’s had foreseen that it would be “a conflict of 
interest”: “I always thought there would be problems.” Another noted, 
“Roger had really made a career at that point in trying to help Manson... He 
was going to soothe the savage beast.” Instead, the beast grew more savage 
than ever. 


“Frenzied Attacks of Unrelenting Rage” 


When he launched the HAFMC, David Smith left a loose end dangling in his 
past: he’d never actually received his PhD in pharmacology. He’d completed 
a two-year research project on amphetamines and their effects on groups of 
confined mice, but he never finished his dissertation. Although he shrugged 
off the lapse—he’d already completed medical school, after all, and he’d 
taken quickly to his new life in the Haight—it surprised many of his closest 
friends, and in our interviews, he was reluctant to admit it. It wasn’t like him 
to leave something undone. 

Even in its unpublished form, Smith’s research on mice defined him, 
creating the larger-than-life personality who would eventually be known as 
“Dr. Dave.” In my obsessive way, I found as much of this research as I could. 
I saw that Smith had published a brief article based on his study in the 


HAFMC’s own house organ, the Journal of Psychedelic Drugs, in 1969. It 
wasn’t nearly as robust as his full thesis would’ve been, but it gave me 
something to go on. 

Before long, I was noticing parallels between Smith’s mice and the 
Family. At first I was inclined to disregard these as the product of my more 
speculative side—I saw no purpose in linking the behavior of mice in a 
controlled experiment to the behavior of people in the world at large. But I 
took another look when I saw that Smith himself had made such a 
connection. He spoke of his mice as proxies for human beings. 

His research started with sixteen albino mice. With the assistance of other 
researchers, he separated these into two groups of eight in “aggregate” 
settings—small, closely confined communities intended to simulate 
crowding. Then he injected the mice with amphetamines. Over the next 
twenty-four hours, they transformed from docile animals into frantic 
combatants, fighting one another until they died either from injuries, self- 
inflicted wounds from overgrooming, or simple exhaustion. The violence was 
unremitting; Smith described “frenzied attacks of unrelenting rage.” 
Afterward, all that remained in the blood-spattered cages were scattered, 
dismembered body parts. Simply by confining the animals in close quarters, 
he’d increased the toxicity of the amphetamines more than four times. 

In another attempt, some of the mice were dosed with other chemicals— 
mescaline, chlorpromazine, or reserpine—before they received amphetamine 
injections. The extra drugs sometimes had a sorting effect, segregating the 
mice that would kill from the mice that wouldn’t. Or they had a soothing 
effect, all but eliminating the violent tendencies. 

Smith told me he’d started his research having foreseen an influx of 
amphetamine abusers in San Francisco. He didn’t say how he’d predicted that 
influx, but he was right. In the summer of ’67, as he opened his clinic, 
amphetamines exploded in popularity in the Haight. 

“When the speed scene hit, it was a total shock to everybody,” he told me. 
“Suddenly, what Pd learned in pharmacology relative to amphetamines was 
applicable [to people].” 

Throughout Love Needs Care, Smith draws parallels between the rodents 
he’d studied and the speed-addled hippies in the Haight. The mice on speed, 
he wrote, “become inordinately aggressive and assaultive... [turning] upon 
one another with unexpected savagery. Their violent behavior is probably 


intensified by confinement for it is strikingly similar to that observed in 
amphetamine abusers who consume the drugs in crowded atmospheres.” 

In the Haight, Smith watched as people living cheek by jowl took huge 
doses of speed, inspiring paranoia and hallucinations. Once peaceful and 
well-adjusted, the “speed freaks” of San Francisco now “lashed out with 
murderous rage at any real or imagined intrusion,” assaulting, raping, or 
torturing to relieve the paranoid tension. “Cut off from the straight world, 
crammed together in inhuman conditions, and controlled by chemicals,” 
Smith concluded, “they behaved, quite naturally, like rats in a cage.” 

But when I spoke to Smith, he was quick to discount these parallels. “I 
happened to study amphetamines before they hit the Haight,” he said. “The 
Haight didn’t give me the idea. It’s kind of like a historical accident... I was 
studying LSD before LSD hit the Haight [too].” 

In fact, according to Dr. Eugene Schoenfeld, who participated in a portion 
of Smith’s rat research in 1965, LSD was an integral component of the 
project. Smith and his colleagues would inject the rats with acid in hopes of 
making them more suggestible before he gave them amphetamines. 
Suggestibility was among the most prized effects of LSD from a clinical 
perspective. And yet Smith kept LSD out of the official documentation of his 
research. The article he published in the Journal of Psychedelic Drugs never 
mentioned acid. 

I asked Smith if LSD was part of his protocol. He denied it—then, a 
moment later, without provocation, he reversed himself. 

“Yeah, I stuck LSD in them,” he said. 

But he couldn’t explain why. “I was sticking all different kinds of drugs in 
them,” he added. In his recollection, LSD “produced disorganized behavior, 
but not violent behavior.” The rats would just wander around in a daze. 

If you’ve noticed that I’ve used “rats” and “mice” interchangeably, there’s 
a reason for that—Smith used them interchangeably, too, even though the 
two species have vastly different behavioral patterns, especially in groups. In 
his Journal of Psychedelic Drugs article, he calls them mice; in Love Needs 
Care and another book he published, they’re rats. Schoenfeld insisted that 
he’d worked with rats during his part of the research. But Smith was adamant 
that they were mice, and he couldn’t explain his confusion on the subject. 

Like the San Francisco Project and Roger Smith’s Amphetamine Research 
Project (ARP), some of David Smith’s research, according to his academic 


papers, was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), 
which, as mentioned earlier, later acknowledged that the CIA used it as a 
front for LSD research. And though David never mentioned it in his writing, 
his work owed a clear debt to the landmark research of another NIMH 
psychologist, John B. Calhoun, who’d studied rat populations since 1946. 

Calhoun reported that rats in confined groups—even without drugs— 
became uncharacteristically aggressive. They’d erupt in rape, murder, 
cannibalism, and infanticide. A dominant male rat emerged in the “behavioral 
sink”—Calhoun’s term for his aggregated rat cultures—subjugating other 
males into a tribe of cowering, enfeebled followers and organizing female 
rats into a “harem” of sex slaves. The strangest group to emerge was “the 
probers”: “hypersexualized” male rats that stalked and raped both males and 
females, and often cannibalized their young. The probers would commit 
“frenzied” and “berserk” attacks against rat families sleeping in their 
burrows, leaving the remains of half-eaten victims. Again, no drugs were 
involved here; the probers emerged simply as a result of their confinement. 
They deferred only to the dominant male rat, fleeing if he caught sight of 
them. 

Calhoun’s study was a watershed. In the midsixties, amid growing 
concerns about population density, social scientists, politicians, and 
journalists cited him to explain the riots in America’s overcrowded ghettos. 
His term “behavioral sink”—defined as “the outcome of any behavioral 
process that collects animals together in unusually great numbers... 
aggravating all forms of pathology that can be found within [the] group”— 
entered the scientific lexicon almost right away. David Smith used it 
extensively in his writing and in interviews with me. 

Though Smith never mentioned Calhoun by name, his research was 
essentially a continuation. He sought to control the pathologies of rats (or was 
it mice?) in crowded environments by aggravating them with amphetamines. 
He concluded that amphetamines were more toxic to rats in groups than rats 
alone. Their crowding essentially exacerbated the effects of the stimulant. 

And this conclusion, like so much in Smith’s research, confused me. I 
didn’t see how it could be objective and unbiased. According to Calhoun, the 
rats’ violence wasn’t intensified by confinement, but created by it. So what 
difference did it make if Smith shot them up with amphetamines? It seemed 
like the equivalent of studying drunk, inexperienced ice skaters to learn about 


alcohol intoxication. The novice skaters were going to fall down on the ice 
anyway, regardless of whether they’d been drinking or not. Plus, the more 
interesting subtleties of Calhoun’s research—the emergence of a dominant 
male, a harem of subservient females, and an underclass of “probers,” all of 
which, it had to be said, sounded a lot like the Family—had gone entirely 
unnoted in Smith’s project. I wondered if amphetamines, with or without 
LSD, had increased the dominant male’s grip on his followers. 

Given how eerily Smith’s research prefigured the creation of the Family— 
under David’s nose, in the Haight, during the summer of ’67—I wondered if 
he had deliberately underreported it. I’ve never come close to proving that he 
did, but I haven’t been able to explain the holes in it, either. Why would he 
use LSD to induce suggestibility in rats before injecting them with 
amphetamines and making them berserk? 

Past a certain point, Smith had little interest in helping me sort it out. 

“I was just talking about the parallels to what happened with the Manson 
Family,” I said, “and when I try to describe your research, I just kept getting 
hung up on—” 

“Well, then why don’t you just forget about the research, then. Just delete 
the whole thing from your book.” 

“Tt was important,” I said. 

“You’re spending way too much of your and my time on it. Take what 
you want and reject the rest.” 


The Psychedelic Syndrome 


When Roger Smith joined forces with the HAFMC to begin the ARP, he was 
picking up where David left off—but this time, the research involved people. 
This meant that both Smiths, and Manson, were often in the same place, at 
the same time, with both Smiths having received funding from a federal 
institute later revealed to be a CIA front. 

“Tt was in a certain sense coincidental,” David said of the arrangement. 
“Roger was the head of the speed project and Charlie came to the Haight and 
visited Roger. He didn’t come to be part of the speed research project. It was 
just that Roger happened to be his [parole] officer.” 

Details on the ARP, and on the pharmacological goings-on at the HAFMC 


more generally, were hard to come by. The reams of record keeping you’d 
expect from clinical experimentation simply weren’t there. Stephen Pittel, a 
forensic psychologist who’d worked with both Smiths at the HAFMC, 
volunteered a stunning bit of information that Roger and David had neglected 
to share with me. 

“The only thing I remember about ARP was that it got burglarized one 
night and Roger lost all of his files,” Pittel told me. Their disappearance had 
been jarring, in part because Roger was “an unusually paranoid guy to begin 
with.” He was especially skittish about Manson. After the murders, Roger 
refused to discuss him with anyone. Pittel assumed that Smith didn’t want to 
be blamed for “directing” Manson to the Haight. “He felt people were saying 
that he was the one who put the toxins into the environment.” 

The HAFMC’s original chief psychiatrist, Dr. Ernest Dernburg, 
remembered the theft of the ARP files, too. As he recalled, they’d gone 
missing right after the announcement of Manson’s arrest for the Tate— 
LaBianca murders and that “Roger, understandably, was pretty upset.” 
Nothing else was taken from the HAFMC, which led the staff to believe that 
the police or some federal agency might’ve removed the files. These were 
research papers, he reminded me: “It didn’t make sense for someone to steal 
these things when they didn’t inherently have any value to the average 
individual. It seemed to have a more nefarious purpose.” 

The Smiths both denied that the theft had ever happened. “You’re dealing 
with aging memories,” David said. But Dernburg and Pittel—full-time 
doctors, and credible sources, I thought—stood by their stories. “They were 
absolutely stolen,” Pittel said. Dernburg, perturbed by David’s insinuation 
about his faculties, told me more that he remembered. “It was a considerable 
amount of research—the premier amphetamine research conducted at a street 
level. It would have been very important to the clinic... and it disappeared. 
Call David. Ask Roger if he has the files or knows where they are.” 

Both men said they had no idea. 


What have survived are the many issues of the Journal of Psychedelic Drugs, 
the HAFMC’s in-house research organ, still active to this day. David Smith 
founded it in ’67, and at various points both he and Roger served on its 
editorial board. In the late sixties and early seventies, the journal printed a 


raft of articles by David and other clinicians about the long-term effects of 
LSD and amphetamines. 

One of these articles hoped to find out “whether a dramatic drug-induced 
experience” would have “a lasting impact on the individual’s personality.” 
Another observed that feelings of “frustrated anger” led people to want to try 
LSD: “The soil from which the ‘flower children’ arise,” the author wrote, “is 
filled more with anger and aggression, thorns and thistles, rather than passion 
and petunias.” Under “emotional pressure,” acid could induce “images and 
sensations of anger or hate magnified into nightmarish proportions.” 

David Smith had studied these same phenomena, formulating an idea that 
he called “the psychedelic syndrome,” first articulated in 1967 or early ’68. 
The gist was that acid, when taken by groups of like-minded people, led to a 
“chronic LSD state” that reinforced “the interpretation of psychedelic 
reality.” The more often the same group of “friends” dropped acid, the more 
they encouraged one another to adopt the worldview they’d discovered 
together on LSD, thus producing “dramatic psychological changes.” 

Usually the psychedelic syndrome was harmless, but regular LSD use 
could cause “the emergence of a dramatic orientation to mysticism.” And in 
people with “prepsychotic personalities,’ Smith wrote, LSD precipitated “a 
long-term psychological disorder, usually a depressive reaction or a 
schizophrenic process.” 

Had Smith seen this “syndrome” in the Family? After Manson had been 
arrested for the murders, David wrote, “Charlie could probably be diagnosed 
as ambulatory schizophrenic.” He said the same thing when I asked about 
Manson: “I felt that he was schizo.” It was Roger Smith who’d had the better 
diagnosis, and the earlier one, David maintained: “Roger said that he knew 
from day one that Charlie was a psychopath.” 

But Roger apparently never thought it was necessary to intervene—to 
send his parolee back to prison or to get him proper psychiatric care. Instead, 
he sent him to the Haight and watched him drop acid every day, accruing 
suggestible young followers as he went. Meanwhile, David was studying the 
exact psychological conditions that gave rise to the Manson Family while he 
treated them at his clinic. Bugliosi had erased all of these facts from his 
history of the group. 


Roger Smith knew that the stereotype of the addict had a lot of potency in the 
popular imagination. Casual drug users were regarded as inherently criminal, 
a tear in the fabric of society. The public’s fear of such people was easily 
manipulated. 

In 1966, the year before Manson was released from prison, Smith 
published a criminology paper called “Status Politics and the Image of the 
Addict,” examining the propaganda that had stigmatized Chinese (or 
“Oriental,” as he put it) opium smokers in San Francisco in the early 
twentieth century. Citing police files and strategy manuals, Smith described 
an organized effort to cast opium addicts—who were by and large peaceful— 
as “insidious” “deviants” who “posed a threat to society.” 

To this end, some agents “were assigned to pose as drug addicts” and 
infiltrate the opium scene. Their objective was to “characterize the addict as a 
dangerous individual likely to rob, rape, or plunder in his crazed state.” And 
it worked: the once invisible opium users of San Francisco’s Chinese ghettos 
were, by 1925, depicted in the media as crazed “dope fiends.” The shift in 
public perception allowed the police to crack down on the Chinese 
population, deporting or institutionalizing the undesirables. Smith neither 
valorized nor condemned these efforts, but he noted that they were effective. 
“The Orientals,” he wrote, “were viewed as a threat to the existing structure 
of life in this country.” Tainting their image meant that they could be 
“differentiated and degraded to the satisfaction of society.” 

It’s not hard to see how such research could be applied to Haight-Ashbury 
hippies in the late sixties. Most Americans frowned on acid, as they frowned 
on all drugs, but it took Charles Manson to give LSD new and fearsome 
dimensions. Suddenly it caused violence, and the hippies who used it were 
perceived as wild-eyed and dangerous where once they’d been harmless, if 
vacuous, pleasure seekers. 

The HAFMC’s goal—free health care for everyone—was an 
unimpeachable part of the hippie ethic, and there could be no doubting that 
David Smith and his volunteer doctors had improved the community. But just 
because the clinic had “Free” in its name didn’t mean that it had no cost. The 
place served as a gateway between the hippie world and the straight world, 
affording doctors a closer look at the hierarchies and nuances of the 
counterculture. In exchange for their “free” health care, patients were held up 
to the light and scrutinized by eager researchers, David Smith chief among 


them. 

Emmett Grogan, the founder of the Diggers, was one of a few observers 
who saw something amiss behind Smith’s idealism. The Diggers were an 
anarchist group known for providing food, housing, and medical aid to 
runaways in the Bay Area. Smith liked them, and he worked with them at a 
free infirmary based out of their Happening House; it inspired his own clinic. 

But as Grogan wrote in his 1972 memoir Ringolevio, the admiration 
wasn’t mutual, at least not for long. Smith soon “began his own self- 
aggrandizement.” He appeared “more concerned with the pharmacology of 
the situation than with treating the ailing people who came to him for help.” 
Grogan noticed that he kept detailed records “about drugs and their abuse.” 
These he used to secure funding for the HAFMC, which he opened only six 
weeks after he’d joined the Diggers’ operation. Grogan saw through the 
HAFMC’s mission statement right away: “Just because no one was made to 
pay a fee when they went there, didn’t make it a ‘free clinic,’” he wrote. “On 
the contrary, the patients were treated as ‘research subjects’ and the facility 
was used to support whatever medical innovations were new and appropriate 
to the agency.” 

Of course, one of these patients was Manson, who became one of David 
Smith’s “research subjects” as well. He was such a special case that Smith 
tracked him far beyond the walls of the HAFMC, sending his top researcher 
all the way down to Los Angeles, where Manson and his ranks of followers 
had set up shop on the timeworn Western sets of the Spahn Ranch. 


The Group-Marriage Commune 


You might remember the name Alan Rose. It was Rose who dropped 
everything and went to Mendocino County in ’68 when several of Manson’s 
followers wound up in jail there. That trip was only a prelude to his deeper 
involvement with the Family, which saw him embed with the group to study 
their sexual dynamics—or just to get laid, depending on whom you ask. 

Rose was a friend of Roger Smith—he’d helped set up the ARP—but he 
was even closer to David Smith, who told me, “Al was like my disciple and I 
was like his father.” A former rabbinical student, Rose had dropped out of 
college in Ohio to move to the Haight in ’66, when he was twenty-one. He 


became the HAFMC’s head administrator and a research assistant, at various 
times, to both Smiths. Rose and David went on to coauthor three studies of 
the Haight’s drug culture in the Journal of Psychedelic Drugs. Like the 
Smiths, Rose had an intuitive grasp of the population and a clinician’s 
knowledge of the drugs they were taking, even though he had no formal 
medical training. 

While reserved and socially awkward by many accounts, Rose enjoyed 
the Haight, especially its sexual openness. He felt inexperienced in that 
regard, and he hoped he could change that when Roger introduced him to 
Manson and the girls, who were coming by the clinic with increasing 
frequency. Rose was enamored. He decided, along with David, that they’d 
make for good research subjects. But already there was the question of his 
impartiality. The legend around the HAFMC was that the girls had “seduced” 
Rose, probably on Manson’s orders. 

When, in June 1968, Manson hand-selected a number of his group to 
accompany him to Los Angeles, Rose may have feared that the yearlong 
party was drawing to a close. He invited the remaining women to move into 
his Haight-Ashbury home, where he could tend to their needs until Manson 
summoned them. 

It was then that some of the girls headed to Ukiah for their ill-fated 
recruitment effort. When they landed in jail, Rose jumped at the chance to 
rescue them. As David Smith described the episode in Love Needs Care, 
Rose outdid himself, visiting the girls daily and fetching candy and cigarettes 
for them. Mary Brunner, the mother of Manson’s newborn son, was still 
lactating. The other girls made a habit of going naked and sucking the milk 
from her breasts. This rattled the jail staff, but Rose vouched for the girls. 
Outside the jail, he kept busy by consulting with lawyers on courtroom 
strategy and preparing his testimony as a character witness. All the while, he 
was living on money funneled to him by David. 

When the case was resolved, the girls made tracks for the Spahn Ranch, 
not wanting to keep Manson waiting. By now, it seemed, Rose couldn’t bear 
to part with them; he elected to go, too. And then he stayed with them. For 
four months. 

Was this a business trip or a vacation? It’s up for debate just how totally 
Rose succumbed to the Family’s power. Judging from the published accounts 
of his time with them, he was more an enabler than a blind devotee. 


Somewhat opaquely, David wrote that Rose was “both a sympathetic cousin 
and... a sociologically oriented participant-observer in the strange communal 
phenomenon.” Roger Smith had used that term “participant-observer,” too, 
for his ARP—he endorsed looking the other way when one’s subjects broke 
the law. Did that same laxness apply to Rose at the Spahn Ranch? 

David provided varying and sometimes contradictory accounts of Rose’s 
role in the Family, and he lost his temper when I tried to set the record 
straight. The first time we spoke, he admitted that “Al became enraptured 
with their philosophy and he traveled with them.” Rose dropped acid with the 
Family, Smith said, “and then six of the girls just fucked his brains out and he 
saw God... He borrowed some money from me and he didn’t pay it back and 
it turned out he gave it to Charlie... So it was, like, very weird.” Other 
sources also remembered Rose having some kind of ecstatic sexual encounter 
with the Family. 

But at some point, the appeal of the group faded for him, and he left. “He 
came back,” Smith said. “I can’t really say he got kicked out. He just said he 
was no longer part of it.” 

And yet, when I revisited the matter with Smith a few years later, he said, 
“T don’t know if Al went to Spahn Ranch.” When I reminded him that he’d 
said otherwise, he made a grudging concession: “He was with them four 
weeks, max!” 

So I tracked down Rose himself, who told me in a phone call that he was 
at the ranch for “probably three or four months.” Rose was shocked that I 
wanted to talk to him—only one other journalist had been in touch—and I 
found him nonchalant about his time with the Family. More than either of the 
Smiths, he came across as mild, somewhat naive, and unassuming. His 
memories of the late sixties had their edges smoothed like stones in the sea. 
Of course he remembered the girls: “They had a level of self-confidence and 
dynamism that was pretty amazing,” he said. “They could walk into stores 
and get checks cashed without ID, okay?” And he remembered the power that 
Manson exuded, recalling a man whose raw charisma was by then tainted 
with egotism and racism. Still, he obeyed Manson, sincerely feeling that his 
“destiny was going with Charlie and the girls.” He added, “We were all pretty 
impressionable, very idealistic... Charlie convinced me I didn’t need glasses. 
I stopped wearing them. He’d have me drive the bus up and down the L.A. 
freeway. I really had to strain.” 


What had finally made him leave the Spahn Ranch was an incident in 
which Manson picked up a prostitute from the freeway and “paraded” her in 
front of his followers, saying that he “wouldn’t have sex with her because she 
wouldn’t give him head. And I just saw that as such an abuse of the power 
that he had.” 

It was late autumn 1968 when Rose returned to the Haight. He moved in 
with Roger and his wife, Carol, in Tiburon, and assisted in writing up two 
studies. The first was Roger’s ARP dissertation. The second was called “The 
Group Marriage Commune: A Case Study,” coauthored with David Smith: 
the first-ever scholarly study of the Manson Family. 


David and Rose believed they had a major research paper on their hands, 
bolstered by Rose’s firsthand observations of the Family. The first published 
remarks about their “study” appeared six weeks after the Family was charged 
with the murders, in a January 1970 interview Smith gave to the Berkeley 
Barb, an alt-weekly. The front-page story was headlined, “M.D. on Manson’s 
Sex Life: Psychologist Who Lived with Manson Family Tells About 
Commune.” 

Smith discussed Rose’s “four months” on the ranch, but he never 
indicated that his coresearcher had been a follower of Manson. Intentionally 
or not, Smith gave the impression that Rose’s time with the Family was part 
of a planned study; in fact, they’d decided to write about the Family only 
after Rose left the commune, a point they’d finesse later. And even though 
Rose was the “psychologist” referred to in the headline, he wasn’t, of course, 
a real psychologist. Smith didn’t let him do any of the talking. Instead, the 
reporter quoted portions of their “scholarly paper,” noting that Smith had 
pulled that article from the presses as soon as he learned that its subjects had 
been accused of mass murder. 

Their paper was eventually published in the Journal of Psychedelic Drugs 
in September 1970. It distanced the HAFMC from Rose’s involvement with 
the Family, and it never identified Manson by his last name, leaving the 
reader to make the connection. “Participation in the commune at the time of 
[Rose’s] involvement,” read the introduction, “was not associated with 
academic observation and only after leaving the communal setting was 
thought given to description.” To exculpate the authors of any responsibility 


for the murders, it fudged the facts about “Charlie,” claiming that during “our 
observation” he “expressed a philosophy of nonviolence... LSD-induced 
psychedelic philosophy was not a major motivational force.” 

Smith further downplayed the Family’s connection to the HAFMC by 
claiming that they only spent “three months” living in the Haight, during 
which their “primary” residence was a bus. In fact, the Family lived in the 
Haight for more than a year, two blocks from the HAFMC, and after Manson 
took some followers to Los Angeles, the others moved into Rose’s home. 

The paper asked why “these young girls” were “so attracted and 
captivated by a disturbed mystic such as Charlie.” That was a great question. 
Past a certain point, it seemed Rose and Smith had no intention of answering 
it. Their paper detailed Manson’s abusive, controlling methods, especially his 
sexual tactics, but it steered clear of their true area of expertise: LSD. Most 
egregiously, the paper was never updated to mention the Tate—LaBianca 
murders, even though it was published a full year later. The defining event of 
the “commune” that Rose had infiltrated was nowhere to be found. 


“Extricated” 


Vincent Bugliosi didn’t have much use for David and Roger Smith, and he 
had no use at all for Alan Rose. He didn’t interview any of them for Helter 
Skelter. The book’s one quote from Roger—“There are a lot of Charlies 
running around, believe me”—was lifted from his short piece in Life 
magazine and framed to make it look as if Bugliosi had actually spoken to 
him. The same was true of David. Bugliosi used him to shrug off the 
implication that drugs enabled the Family, quoting his assertion that “sex, not 
drugs, was the common denominator.” That quote is also pulled misleadingly 
from Life—David had written about Manson in the same issue. (Given the 
realm of David Smith’s research, I can’t see how he really believed it.) Other 
than that, the Smiths are absent from a story that might never have unfolded 
without them. 

A book is one thing—Bugliosi had dramatic license. Maybe he just didn’t 
think he could do justice to Manson’s messy year in Haight-Ashbury. The 
trial was different. There, Bugliosi had to convince the jury beyond a 
reasonable doubt that Manson had enough control over his followers to get 


them to kill for him. He got former Family members to testify in exchange 
for lighter sentences or dropped charges; they provided vivid illustrations of 
Manson’s domination. But he never called Roger or David Smith, two 
authorities who’d had almost daily exposure to Manson as he formed the 
group. 

Bugliosi’s obsession with convicting Manson of conspiracy is the drama 
that drives Helter Skelter forward. To get Manson’s guilty verdict, he had to 
demonstrate that Manson had ordered the murders and had enough control 
over the killers that they would do his bidding without question. And he was 
desperate to do this. He wanted witnesses who could say that “Manson 
ordered or instructed anyone to do anything,” he told his subordinates. He 
had to prove “domination.” 

Roger Smith’s and David Smith’s Life essays, the same ones Bugliosi 
quoted in Helter Skelter, came out a month before Bugliosi issued those 
marching orders to LAPD detectives. Within weeks, the Berkeley Barb and 
Los Angeles Free Press ran their front-page stories featuring David Smith’s 
discussion of Manson’s “indoctrination” techniques, his “process of 
reorienting” new recruits, and his “methods of disciplining family members.” 

Bugliosi told the jury he’d prove that Manson was “the dictatorial leader 
of the Family.” He was still calling witnesses to the stand when David Smith 
and Alan Rose’s research paper came out, featuring such lines as “[Manson] 
served as absolute ruler.” 

Yet the Smiths and Alan Rose told me that Bugliosi never got in touch 
with them. Nor did anyone else from the Los Angeles DA’s office or the 
LAPD. Despite their extensive knowledge of the Family, the researchers 
never felt it was their duty to tell the authorities what they knew. If anything, 
David Smith feared testifying. “I remember not wanting to be involved in that 
trial,” he said. “I felt that it would compromise our clinic.” 

Dr. Dernburg, the psychiatric director of the HAFMC when the Family 
went there, followed the trial with mounting gloom as he realized that the 
whole San Francisco chapter of Manson’s life was never going to come out. 
He told me it was “as if Manson’s stay up here had been extricated from the 
whole mass of data.” 

I couldn’t wrap my head around this. Why did Bugliosi ignore the most 
powerful prosecution evidence available: eyewitness testimony of Manson’s 
control from his parole officer, a laureled medical researcher, and his 


assistant, who’d lived with the group? Each could’ve taken the witness stand 
independently, untainted by the suggestion of a plea arrangement or some 
type of deal. 

I knew Pd have to ask Bugliosi about this eventually, but by that point I 
didn’t trust him, and I wanted to box him in as much as I could. So I called 
on Stephen Kay, his coprosecutor, to show him all the evidence of the 
Smiths’ relationships with the Family. I was on good terms with Kay, and I 
felt I could rely on him to be straight with me. At his office, I laid out the two 
Life essays, which I knew Bugliosi had seen, plus press accounts of the 
Smiths and the HAFMC research papers. 

Kay read through them diligently. “I have never seen these before,” he 
said, his mouth open. I asked him if there was any way that Bugliosi had 
missed this stuff. Absolutely not, Kay said. “Vince read all the newspapers, 
every paper that came out. He subscribed to every paper. 

“I know everything we had in the files,” Kay went on, “because we had a 
big file cabinet. I’d been through all that.” He was positive they didn’t have 
the Smiths’ papers and articles there. If Bugliosi knew about them, “he 
wasn’t keeping them in the regular file.” 

As far as Kay could recall, Bugliosi had never discussed the Smiths and 
Alan Rose, never entertained the idea of putting them on the stand. But Kay 
couldn’t understand why. “If we had an independent person like that,” he told 
me, “that’s much better than calling a member of the Manson Family... They 
would have been dynamite witnesses for us.” 

Although the Smiths never appeared in the courtroom, there’s a link 
between their research and Bugliosi’s reasoning that continues to perplex me. 
In the first phase of the trial, the prosecutor persuaded the jury that Manson 
had controlled his followers’ every thought and action, full stop. In the trial’s 
death-penalty phase, he had to refine that argument somewhat. Because the 
defendants could be sentenced to death only if they were acting under their 
own free will, Bugliosi claimed that, regardless of their brainwashing, each of 
them had the independent capacity to murder. As Bugliosi explained it to me 
in our first meeting in 1999, Manson had somehow learned that a select few 
of his followers were willing and able to kill. “Something in the deepest 
resources of their soul enabled them to do something that you and I cannot 
do,” he said to me that day. “There was something independent of Charles 
Manson that was coursing through them... These people not only killed for 


him, but they did it with gusto, with relish. One hundred and sixty-nine stab 
wounds! Some of them postmortem! What does that show? I think it’s 
circumstantial evidence that some people have much more homicidal 
tendencies than others.” 

It’s those “tendencies” that recall David Smith’s research. In a 1969 issue 
of the Journal of Psychedelic Drugs, Smith wrote that the main purpose of 
his experiments with mice was to “isolate” the “behavioral” traits of the 
rodents that would kill after they’d been aggregated and injected with 
amphetamines—and then to “modify” their behavior using other drugs. Two 
years later, writing of the study and its parallels to hippies in the Haight in 
Love Needs Care, Smith admitted that “it has yet to be determined whether 
amphetamines modify the personality primarily by biochemically altering the 
central nervous system or by reinforcing or precipitating long-term 
psychological tendencies.” Strikingly, as Bugliosi had it, those 
“psychological tendencies” were exactly what Manson had learned to exploit. 

In the two years before the Manson murders, several papers in the Journal 
of Psychedelic Drugs and other periodicals looked at the increase of 
psychotic violence in the Haight and its link to amphetamines, LSD, and 
population density. Some made reference to a forthcoming paper by David 
Smith, Roger Smith, and Alan Rose on the role that personality factors 
played in users’ reactions to drugs. Why was it that, after just one experience 
with amphetamines or LSD, certain people experienced hallucinations that 
lasted for days or even weeks? Were the drugs to blame, or some aspect of 
the users’ psychology? Their paper promised to look into the phenomenon. 

But when the article, “Acute Amphetamine Toxicity,” finally appeared in 
the spring 1969 Journal of Psychedelic Drugs, both Roger Smith and Alan 
Rose had been removed as authors. Contradicting his later claim in Love 
Needs Care, David Smith wrote that he “disagreed” with the consensus that 
“personality was the prime factor in differentiating between psychotic and 
nonpsychotic reactions,” arguing instead that “in the drug subculture of the 
Haight-Ashbury, the prime determinates of psychotic vs. nonpsychotic 
reactions were immediate drug environment and experience of the user.” 
More significant than the contradiction, I felt, was the article’s obscurity: 
when the HAFMC republished bound editions of all the Journals five years 
later, “Acute Amphetamine Toxicity” wasn’t included in the collection. All 
the annotations referring to it in other Journal articles had been removed, too. 


Just as Manson’s time in the Haight was “extricated” from the record at trial, 
the study by the two Smiths and Alan Rose—a study into the origins of the 
same psychological tendencies found in members of the Manson Family— 
had disappeared. 


Coda: Six Hours with Roger Smith 


Even now, more than a decade later, I get excited when I look at the host of 
documents I showed Kay that day. Flipping through them, I remember how I 
felt when I was first reporting on Manson’s lost year in San Francisco. I 
thought I’d found the angle that would set my story apart from the reams of 
others—the beginnings of a working theory about what really motivated the 
Tate—LaBianca murders. True, it had come too late to work for Premiere, but 
it could be the linchpin for my book. 

I pinned a lot of my hopes on one last interview: a sit-down with Roger 
Smith. It was set for late December 2001. My deal with Premiere had been 
off for a year and I was living off savings, but they were dwindling. If I 
wanted to earn more money, I’d have to finish my book proposal and sell it to 
a publisher. 

When I spoke to Smith, I knew I had to come away with something so 
solid that I could finish my reporting. And I sincerely believed that I could. 
To me, it was obvious that Smith had covered something up, and the 
evidence was so abundant on this point that I’d have no trouble confronting 
him about it, even if our exchange got contentious. I would show him 
documents he hadn’t seen in more than three decades. I would press him on 
his connections to the HAFMC, to Manson, to David Smith, and more; I 
would ask him why he’d never sent Manson back to prison and why he’d 
gone along with the bizarre plot to send him to Mexico. 

Needless to say, it didn’t work out like that. 


After the Manson murders, Smith had spent his career behind the well- 
fortified walls of numerous federal penitentiaries, where he ran specialized 
units studying or treating sex offenders and drug addicts. It was a path that 
afforded him plenty of privacy. Over the years, he’d lived on a yacht off the 
coast of Hawaii; in rural Bend, Oregon; and in a farmhouse more than a 


century old, surrounded by cornfields, in Ypsilanti, Michigan, outside Ann 
Arbor. 

Smith had agreed to the interview without a moment’s hesitation, though 
Pd called him out of the blue. He was preparing to retire after a decade as 
director of the Bureau of Mental Forensics for the Michigan State 
Penitentiary System, and he claimed that none of the many people from his 
circle I’d interviewed by then had said anything to him about me. On the 
phone, he told me that he’d been reticent about Manson over the years for 
fear that the affiliation would tarnish his career. “I’m close to retirement 
now,” he said, “so maybe it’s okay to talk.” 

Our interview began in his office at the prison. It ended at his beautifully 
restored farmhouse, nearly six hours, a pizza, and several bottles of wine 
later. It was late December, and snow was falling—outside, the fields were 
blanketed in white and the houses, his included, twinkled with Christmas 
lights. Smith lived with his second wife, Carmen, who sat with us in the 
living room for almost the entirety of the interview. A fire roared in the 
hearth. Soft rock emanated from a station he’d found on satellite TV. The 
couple was unfailingly courteous, and I found Smith a patient listener; only a 
few times did he betray any frustration with my lines of questioning, even as 
I forced him to examine papers he hadn’t seen in thirty-five years. 

But the fact was this: he gave me nothing. On the most important 
questions about his relationship to Manson, he pleaded ignorance, or claimed 
he had no memory at all. 

“I’ve never been able to understand how he ended up under [your] 
supervision in San Francisco if he was paroled in L.A.,” I said. 

“T really don’t know, either,” Smith said. He posited that parole protocols 
were more relaxed back in the sixties, and that officials just didn’t care if 
Manson took himself to another city. “Different time, then, I think.” 

Smith had a memory of interviewing Manson as part of his “prerelease” 
from prison—a routine process that couldn’t have involved him, at least not 
officially, if Manson was released in Los Angeles. 

“Well, I guess I didn’t,” he replied when I told him that. “I don’t even 
remember that he was released out of L.A.” 

But I thought I’d have him dead to rights on the question of Manson’s 
arrests during his parole supervision. I had him look over the letter he’d sent 
to Washington, D.C., asking for permission for Manson to travel to Mexico. 


“He was actually in jail then, in Ukiah,” I told Smith. 

“Really!... I was never notified. This is a mystery to me... I should’ve 
been notified.” 

“By Manson or by the people who arrested him?” I asked. 

“By the people who arrested him,” Smith said. “There would be some 
federal record of his arrests, convictions, incarcerations, his criminal justice 
status.” 

“Would his parole have been violated for that arrest?” 

“Oh, absolutely.” 

I didn’t know it at the time, but Smith was right, in a way. There were two 
federal documents—Manson’s FBI rap sheet and his Bureau of Criminal 
Identification and Investigation Record—listing his July 31, 1967, 
conviction, proving that the government had been notified. The first of those 
documents dated to the time of Smith’s supervision, so he would’ve been 
notified, too—the probation office receives such papers as a matter of course 
—but he was saying he wasn’t. For good measure, I checked with another 
federal parole officer who’d worked in the Bay Area in that era. He 
confirmed that the Justice Department would’ve automatically notified Smith 
of Manson’s conviction. “Even back then,” he said, “the federal guys didn’t 
mess up.” 

Whenever I reread my interview transcripts, I wince at moments like this. 
I prepared diligently for these conversations, especially in cases where I 
thought the right questions could bring major new revelations. Reliving 
marathon interviews like this, I sometimes kick myself even for having had to 
stop the conversation to go to the bathroom—maybe if I hadn’t taken a break, 
things would’ve gone differently. 

Even now, I wonder what could’ve happened if I’d held off on 
confronting Smith until Pd marshaled every possible resource. In 2001, for 
example, I hadn’t yet found the glowing recommendation he’d provided for 
Susan Atkins, effectively winning her probation a year before the murders. If 
Pd had that, I could’ve challenged a bunch of the assertions he made about 
Atkins that night—he called her a “hard, hard lady,” and he hoped that she 
never got out of prison. “She was scary. She was aggressive. I thought she 
was sort of Charlie’s operative.” Quite an about-face from the man who’d 
claimed in 1968 that Atkins would “comply willingly with any probationary 
conditions aimed at her rehabilitation.” 


I pointed out that Manson had apparently continued to invoke Smith’s 
name after their parole relationship dissolved. Manson and the girls continued 
visiting him at his office at the HAFMC, and even at his home. I told Smith, 
“T think he was still trying to pass you off as his PO.” 

But all he had to say on the subject was: “Oh, really!” 

When Smith said he’d never been asked to testify at the trial, despite 
having served as “an expert witness in lots and lots of trials,” I told him and 
his wife how much that baffled me. They seemed perplexed, too. I asked, 
“Was there something going on behind the scenes that your testifying would 
have exposed, a Big Picture, that they didn’t want exposed? Maybe like in 
L.A., where they kept releasing him for offenses without charging him when 
they had evidence against him?” 

For the first time, Smith lost his temper. “Okay, you’re operating from the 
theory that he was tied in—something else was going on. Tom, I can’t help 
you. I don’t know.” His face reddened, and he shouted, “I really don’t 
know!” 

“Because you were part of his gestating phase in San Francisco, I thought 
maybe you might have an indication.” 

“Yeah, I saw his talent. I saw his bullshit. He was very glib,” Smith said. 
“T had known for a long time how powerful his effect was on people... his 
particular brand of psychobabble was as persuasive as anybody on the street.” 

He reminded me that San Francisco in the late sixties may as well have 
been another country, so different were its customs and mores. I was 
sympathetic, to a point. By then I’d spoken to so many people about this 
period that it felt at once totally near and completely alien. So many of my 
sources, even the most reliable, had trouble explaining their feelings and 
motivations, not just because so much time had passed but because some 
schism stood between them and the past. It was irreparable—wherever the 
sixties had come from, they were gone, even in memory. 

As we refilled our wineglasses, Smith conjured the scene: “It was a time 
when birth control pills first became widely available... You will find this 
absolutely stupid—women used to walk around and pull up their sweaters to 
show that they didn’t have bras and they would actually seek you out to have 
sex. Unheard-of.” He continued, “Then comes the whole drug thing. Then 
comes the Haight-Ashbury. The whole Bay Area was one of the most electric 
places you could possibly be... It was like a magnet.” 


Manson, he said, had arrived at the tail end of this innocence. When Smith 
traded his parole job for the ARP, he remembered the Haight already yielding 
to speed, “the beginning of one of the most incredibly destructive patterns of 
drug use I’d ever seen... The first six months I was there, there were thirty 
murders within, like, a six-block radius of the office we had. It was middle- 
class, totally naive kids... it was the worst maudlin, stupid theater that you’ve 
ever seen.” 

In a scene like that, the Charlie Mansons of the world were a dime a 
dozen. The Haight was so flooded with weirdos, seekers, addicts, and guru 
figures that no one batted an eye at him. If anything, Smith said, Manson was 
a little more respectable than many of them, insofar as he eschewed speed 
and asked his followers to do the same. 

“He was very odd. He was a hippie, it was clear. He was very 
manipulative—but was he highly dangerous? Didn’t see it... I did let him 
travel, and there were some checks and balances. Basically, when he was in 
the Bay Area, he was in my office every week. I saw him a lot. Not only in 
the office... he came in with his girls after a while and I think that became 
kind of an annoyance to the office.” 

I made a mental note of that comment. It seemed to confirm that Manson 
was visiting Smith for official parole meetings at the HAFMC. Later, he 
backed away from it. 

“My association with the clinic really was pretty intermittent,” he said. “It 
wasn’t until after I left federal probation that I came down there.” 

“The chronology confuses me,” I said. “The people at the clinic all 
thought he was coming in for probation.” 

“No, no, no, I had left probation.” 

“So he was just coming in to say hello?” 

“First of all, he didn’t come in that often,” Smith said. “I never saw him in 
any official way and I also never invited him.” There could be nothing 
untoward about Manson’s appearances at the HAFMC, he implied, because a 
conspiracy takes careful planning, and no one there had the capacity to plan 
anything. “Nothing happened according to schedule in the Haight-Ashbury. 
You had people walking around jacked up on two grams of speed tempered 
out with heroin and people carrying guns and tweaking on acid and it was 
absolutely crazy. Actually, Charlie and his girls were the sanest people 
around in some ways.” 


That claim shouldn’t have surprised me. Manson had endeared himself to 
Smith; they were close enough that Smith felt comfortable taking care of 
Manson’s baby. He’d looked after the child for “a couple of months, I think. I 
know it was long enough to have the baby circumcised, which I think really 
pissed him off.” 

When we’d finished our pizza and made our way through most of the final 
bottle of wine, I steered Smith back toward the subject of Manson’s 
psychology. I still felt that he was trying to have it both ways: to 
acknowledge Manson’s anger and instability and, sometimes in the same 
breath, to downplay the eccentricities of a man who’d started a cult as Smith 
watched on. 

“There was this unquestioned loyalty to Charlie while they were in San 
Francisco, [but] there was almost a good-natured quality to it,’ Smith told 
me. “There was still the ability to joke with him, and push him.” In his mind, 
the move to the Spahn Ranch was fatal, in that it took the Family out of 
society. “They were isolated. They were doing acid every day and they were 
essentially without any reality checks at all... There’s a time when everything 
flips. And I don’t know when that was, but it sure as hell wasn’t when he was 
in San Francisco.” 

Explaining why he refused to talk about Manson for more than twenty- 
five years, he said, “There were a lot of people who became overnight experts 
on Manson... particularly back then. Even now. I’m prepared to tell you to 
get the fuck out of here at some point. You understand what I’m doing here 
and what’s important, which is me. The thing is, Tom, as I look back on that 
time I don’t know what else I could have done... I felt real sadness about it— 
I don’t feel any culpability.” 

That about summed it up. Soon I thanked Smith and his wife for their 
generosity and got to my feet. We’d all had some wine, and there was a 
warmth, if not a trust, in their rustic old farmhouse. I remembered suddenly 
that it was almost Christmas. They led me to the back door, both of them 
waving as they saw me out, flakes of snow still falling from the night sky. In 
my rental car, I took the old highway back past the prison that Smith worked 
at; apparently he’d personally planned their new, ten-million-dollar mental 
health care facility. The thought of it made me feel small. 

He’d been more than accommodating, hadn’t he? And he’d taken a 
serious look at the papers I’d found, had given serious consideration to my 


questions... On the face of it, I had no reason to be dissatisfied, having just 
gotten hours of tape from one of the most reclusive officials connected to 
Charles Manson. 

And yet, as I dwelled on it, the interview felt strange and inconclusive. 
The closer I got to my motel, the sadder I got. I wasn’t finished with the 
story, or even close to finished. Pd gone to Michigan expecting to shock 
Roger Smith with incontrovertible evidence of everything he’d overlooked. 
He had reacted, basically, with six hours of shrugging and some free wine 
and pizza. 

Soon enough, I’d transcribe the interview and start to work away at the 
little inconsistencies and contradictions in Smith’s account, but at the 
moment I was crestfallen. Even supposing I could find something to push 
back on, was I right about any of it? Or had Smith entertained six hours of 
questioning from someone peddling conspiracy theories? His denials felt 
wrong to me, but I’d had hours to prove my case to him, to get him to break, 
and I hadn’t. 

I headed back home to Philadelphia for the holidays. No one knows me 
better than my family, and over the Christmas break, they noticed right away 
that something was off. I was aloof, skipping meals to work on the book 
proposal and figure out my next moves. Stuck in my own head, going 
through the paces of my story, I tried to construct a coherent narrative out of 
interview transcripts and dozens of discarded drafts of my dead Premiere 
piece. With no new revelations from Roger Smith, the ending was a big 
blank. 

Pd also told my father, sheepishly, that I was running out of money. He 
generously offered me a loan, as much as I needed to keep me afloat—and I 
accepted. I meant it when I promised I’d pay him back. 

My father was a tax attorney and law professor, and I realized that I’d 
never given him a full debriefing on my reporting, even as it became 
increasingly legalistic. That Christmas I filled him in on everything I’d 
learned, walking him through my collection of three-ring binders, their pages 
now dog-eared and marked with a rainbow of neon highlights and plastic 
reference tabs. 

To my relief, I watched as my sober-minded father transitioned to my 
thinking. He’d told me that he never trusted Bugliosi—too arrogant, too 
flamboyant—and now he was ready to roll up his sleeves, take out his red 


pen, and help me in the best way he knew how, by arguing with the U.S. 
government for records. With his legal knowledge, he helped me fill out new 
FOIA requests and file appeals to old ones. In the coming months, and for 
several years, he accomplished what I’d been unable to, forcing unwilling 
bureaucrats to fill in redacted documents and release information in dribs and 
drabs. It wasn’t enough, of course, to fill in all the gaps, but it got me closer 
to the truth—and it would never have been possible if I hadn’t won over my 
old buttoned-up dad. He believed in what I’d found. He had the same 
questions that I did, especially about the parole board’s reluctance to release 
Manson’s file. Why were they hiding all this? Everything about the case 
should be publicly available, he thought. His skepticism kept me going. 

After the new year, he drove me to the airport so I could fly back to L.A. 
Pll never forget the father-son pep talk he gave me. It doesn’t matter to us, he 
said, if you’re never able to prove all of this. The fact that you tried so hard is 
all that matters to us. I headed back to the West Coast feeling reinvigorated, 
aware of how lucky I was to have my family behind me. At least, I thought, I 
could have my book out in time for the fortieth anniversary of the murders, in 
2009.

Mind Control 


Off the Deep End 


I can still remember the email I sent to my agent. I’d made peace with the 
fact that I’d never reach a firm conclusion on Manson’s involvement with the 
Smiths. I’d accepted that I had to break off my reporting and move ahead on 
my book proposal. I’d even taken a full week off—for the first time since I’d 
started in ’?99—to clear my head. And then Jolly West happened. 

“You’re not gonna like this,” I wrote to my agent, pausing before I typed 
the next line: “but I think the JFK assassination is involved.” I paused again. 
“And the CIA’s mind-control experiments.” 

I rewrote it a bunch of different ways, trying to make myself sound less 
insane, but when I hit send, I still wished right away that I hadn’t. I might 
lose the one publishing professional I had in my corner. And at this point I’d 
understand if he cut and ran. He always seemed to hold his breath when I 
mentioned a new “finding,” but now I knew I was pressing my luck. 

What I’d written was true, though, and I was confident he’d understand. 
Through my research on the HAFMC, I’d learned that yet another shadowy 
researcher kept an office there—and that his LSD research had clearer, more 
nefarious ties to the CIA than any of the others. At least his name wasn’t 
Smith this time: he was Dr. Louis Jolyon West. His friends called him 
“Jolly,” for his middle name, his impressive girth, and his oversized 
personality. Pursuing West felt like the logical thing to do, but it also meant 
swimming deeper into the waters of conspiracy, where, as near as I could tell, 
only the real nut jobs had wandered before me. I thought of Bill Nelson, the 


creepy Manson memorabilia dealer I’d once met at a Denny’s. Was there 
something about the isolation and intensity of this work that appealed to me 
when it pushed most people away? 

I’d dared to tell my agent about any of this only because I’d found firm 
documentation for a long whispered rumor about West. He’d used drugs and 
hypnosis to conduct behavior-control experiments on Americans without 
their knowledge or consent. That allegation had landed on the front page of 
the New York Times in 1977, but West had denied it until the day he died, and 
no one had ever proven the charge. I could, and I thought it was my biggest 
scoop yet. West’s résumé was so chockablock with intrigue and mad-scientist 
larks that even someone like Reeve Whitson, who behaved like a spy out of a 
GQ spread, paled in comparison. 

Born in Brooklyn in 1924, West had enlisted in the army air force during 
World War II, eventually rising to the rank of colonel. He came to my interest 
when I learned that he’d accepted an office at the Haight-Ashbury clinic from 
David Smith himself to recruit subjects for LSD research. 

Earlier in his career, West researched methods of controlling human 
behavior at Cornell University. During the Korean War, he helped to 
“deprogram” returning prisoners of war who’d allegedly been brainwashed. 
His success earned him national attention. Around the same time, he achieved 
still more fame when he joined civil rights activists like his friend the actor 
Charlton Heston, as well as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., in marches 
demanding equal rights for African Americans. Ironically, while he was 
fighting for the rights of some, he was suspected of infringing on those of 
others. His detractors alleged that through the fifties and early sixties, at air 
force bases in Texas and Oklahoma, he performed experiments on unwitting 
subjects using LSD and hypnosis. 

After John F. Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963, West 
psychiatrically examined Jack Ruby, who’d murdered Kennedy’s assassin, 
Lee Harvey Oswald. Not long before Ruby was due to testify for the Warren 
Commission, West examined him alone in his jail cell. He emerged to report 
that Ruby had suffered an “acute psychotic break.” Sure enough, Ruby’s 
testimony before the commission succeeded only in making him sound 
unhinged. He could never fully explain why he’d decided to kill Oswald. 

Through the seventies, journalists linked West to the CIA’s mind-control 
research program, MKULTRA. He denied all involvement, vigorously 


attacking anyone who suggested otherwise. He kept up those attacks until his 
death in 1999. Then seventy-four, he’d been diagnosed with metastatic 
cancer, and he prevailed on his son to help him commit suicide with a 
cocktail of pills. 

I had only a fraction of that information at my disposal when I first heard 
about West, but you can see why I felt I had to expand the frame of my 
reporting—yet again—just when I’d promised myself to narrow it. Nearly 
every psychiatrist and researcher I spoke to from Haight-Ashbury had 
invoked his name, often unfavorably. When I saw that he’d been accused of 
conducting mind-control experiments, I second-guessed myself; this was not 
an excursion to be taken lightly. 

West had spent the last decades of his career at UCLA, where he’d 
become something of an institution, heading the psychiatry department’s 
renowned neuroscience center; the university had named an auditorium in his 
honor. When I called the school, I learned that he’d donated his papers to 
them, but since no one had asked to see them, they’d never been processed. 
No one had so much as opened the first box. I would be the first reporter to 
look at them. 

For weeks I convinced myself to leave well enough alone. There was 
more than enough to fill out my book proposal. I didn’t need to involve 
something as vast and intractable as secret government-sponsored mind- 
control experiments. But I had a gut feeling that something important was in 
those files. It gnawed at me. 

One day I ran out of willpower. I hopped in my car and drove to the 
library. Soon I was showing up every day when the building opened, staying 
for hours to read in the basement, and leaving only when they kicked me out 
at closing time. 


Faking a “Hippie Crash Pad” 


Late in the fall of 1966, Jolly West arrived in San Francisco to study hippies 
and LSD. The Bay Area had seen an unprecedented migration of middle- 
class youth and an explosion of recreational drug use. West felt he had to 
witness it firsthand. He secured a government grant and took a yearlong 
sabbatical from his professorship at the University of Oklahoma, nominally 


to pursue a fellowship at Stanford, although that school had no record of his 
participation in a program there. 

West was a square—tall, broad, and crew cut, with an all-American look 
in keeping with his military past. If he wanted a good glimpse of the hippies, 
he’d have to blend in. He started cobbling together a new wardrobe and 
skipping haircuts. 

At least he had a solid knowledge base. The summer of love had yet to 
come, and the Tate—LaBianca murders were still years away, but West would 
effectively predict them both. In a 1967 psychiatry textbook, he’d contributed 
a chapter called “Hallucinogens,” warning students of a “remarkable 
substance” percolating through college campuses and into cities across the 
United States. It was LSD, known to leave users “unusually susceptible and 
emotionally labile” as it caused a “loosening of ego structure.” That language 
was reminiscent of the “reprogramming” spiel that Charles Manson would 
soon develop, urging his acid-tripping followers to “negate their egos.” 

When West cautioned against the “LSD cults” springing up in America’s 
“bohemian” quarters, he described exactly the kind of disenchanted 
wanderers who’d flock to a personality like Manson’s in the years to come. 
West had a hunch that alienated kids “with a pathological desire to withdraw 
from reality” would crave “shared forbidden activity in a group setting to 
provide a sense of belonging.” 

Another paper by West, 1965’s “Dangers of Hypnosis,” foresaw the rise 
of dangerous groups led by “crackpots” who hypnotized their followers into 
violent criminality. Contrary to the prevailing science at the time, West 
asserted that hypnosis could make people so pliable that they’d violate their 
moral codes. Scarier still, they’>d have no memory of it afterward. Just 
because such outcomes were rare, he argued, didn’t mean they were 
impossible. 

West cited two cases to back up his argument: a double murder in 
Copenhagen committed by a hypno-programmed man, and a “military 
offense” induced experimentally at an undisclosed U.S. Army base. He 
“personally knew” of two other instances, and he’d “heard on excellent 
authority” of three more, but he didn’t elaborate. Later, I’d get a sense of 
what, or who, he might have had in mind. 

When he arrived in Haight-Ashbury, then, West was the only scientist in 
the world who’d predicted the emergence of potentially violent “LSD cults.” 


How had he learned so much about acid? You’d never know from his 
published writing that he’d conducted innumerable experiments with it. In 
San Francisco, he hoped to conduct more still. 


In the Haight, West found a group of kindred spirits at David Smith’s new 
clinic, where plenty of shrinks from the “straight world” were basking in 
hippiedom. Getting his bearings at the HAFMC, he arranged for the use of a 
crumbling Victorian house on nearby Frederick Street, where he opened what 
he described as a “laboratory” disguised as a “hippie crash pad.” This would 
serve as a “Semi-permanent observation post,” granting him an up-close-and- 
personal look at the youth. He installed six graduate students in the “pad,” 
telling them to “dress like hippies” and “lure” itinerant kids into the 
apartment. Passersby were welcome to do as they pleased and stay as long as 
they liked, as long as they didn’t mind grad students taking copious notes on 
their behavior. 

The “pad” opened in June 1967, at the dawn of the summer of love. West 
took pains to ensure that it felt realistic, decorating it “with posters, flowers 
and paint.” Thus was born the Haight-Ashbury Project, as he called it, or 
“HAP,” for short. For the next six months, he undertook “an ongoing 
program of intensive interdisciplinary study into the life and times of the 
hippies.” 

To drum up hippie business, West stopped by the HAFMC, where David 
Smith could furnish willing subjects. Smith even gave him an office. Having 
a nationally recognized researcher like West working out of the HAFMC 
would attract sorely needed government funding. 

“We helped him with research,” Smith told me. He was sympathetic to 
West’s project, even though he admitted that he never bothered to find out 
what it was, or what its objectives were. He assumed that West, like himself, 
was diagnosing “psychedelic patterns in the counterculture,” trends that 
others had dismissed as boorish fads. 

“They came over and interviewed kids that came into our clinic,” Smith 
said of West and his students. “He wanted to know, ‘What is a hippie?’” 
Smith reminded me that “this was a very new population... the fact that large 
numbers of white middle-class kids would use illicit drugs was a total 
mindblower.” 


Who was paying for all this? According to records in West’s files, his 
“crash pad” was funded by the Foundations Fund for Research in Psychiatry, 
Inc., which had bankrolled a number of his other projects, too, across decades 
and institutions. For reasons soon to be clear, I concluded that the 
Foundations Fund was a front for the CIA. 

This wouldn’t have been the agency’s first “disguised laboratory” in San 
Francisco. A few years earlier, the evocatively titled Operation Midnight 
Climax had seen CIA operatives open at least three Bay Area safe houses 
disguised as upscale bordellos, kitted out with one-way mirrors and kinky 
photographs. A spy named George Hunter White and his colleagues hired 
prostitutes to entice prospective johns to the homes, where the men were 
served cocktails laced with acid. White scrupulously observed the ensuing 
activities, whatever they were. The goal was to see if LSD, paired with sex, 
could be used to coax sensitive information from the men—something of a 
psychedelic honeypot experiment. White so enjoyed the proceedings that he 
had a portable toilet and a mini-fridge installed on his side of the mirror, so 
he could watch the action and swill martinis without taking a bathroom break. 
He later wrote to his CIA handler, “I was a very minor missionary, actually a 
heretic, but I toiled wholeheartedly in the vineyards because it was fun, fun, 
fun. Where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, kill and cheat, steal, 
deceive, rape and pillage with the sanction and blessing of the All-Highest? 
Pretty Good Stuff, Brudder!” 

West knew better than to commit such sentiments to paper, but by 1967 
he’d “toiled wholeheartedly in the vineyards,” too. Before he moved to the 
Haight, he’d supervised a similar study in Oklahoma City, hiring informants 
to infiltrate teenage gangs and engender “a fundamental change” in “basic 
moral, religious or political matters.” The title of the project was Mass 
Conversion. As I was soon to see, its funds came from Sidney J. Gottlieb, the 
head of the CIA’s MKULTRA program. 

In other words, as I said to David Smith, it was all but certain that Jolly 
West came to the Haight to answer a more ignoble question than “What is a 
hippie?” 

“That would be a cover project,” I told Smith. 

“Oh, shit,” he said. 


“Is This an Asphalt Sherwood Forest?” 


What was Jolly West really up to in San Francisco? Hanging out at his “crash 
pad” and roaming the streets of the Haight, he tried to pass as an apostle of 
free love, but few were fooled. Bob Conrich, a cofounder of the HAFMC, 
saw through the ruse right away. West “walked into the clinic one day and 
my first reaction was that he’d read too many Tim Leary interviews,” 
Conrich wrote to me. West was a careerist in hippies’ clothing. “What I 
remember is his enthusiasm for the whole ‘summer of love’ thing, which 
seemed exaggerated and insincere.” 

Conrich was right. West’s excitement was a sham, his feelings for hippies 
dripping with condescension. He soon concluded that the constellation of sex, 
drugs, and communalism shining over the Haight that summer was “doomed 
to fail”: “The very chemicals they use will inevitably enervate them as 
individuals and bleed the energies of the hippie movement to its death.” He 
called this an “ineffable tragedy,” but it’s hard to imagine he saw it that way. 
For West, the failure of sixties idealism was the most desirable outcome— 
one that he was quite possibly working toward. A copy of his résumé from 
this period hints at the thrust of his research. He was at work on a book called 
Experimental Psychopathology: The Induction of Abnormal States. But he 
never published it. Nor, on the surface, would “the induction of abnormal 
states” dovetail with the stated goals of his HAP. By the early seventies he 
removed the title from his résumé and never mentioned it again. 

Stephen Pittel, the forensic psychologist, worked briefly with West in 
1968 and referred to him as “the only benevolent psychopath I ever met.” 
The man could “charm the pants off of anyone, and manipulate people into 
doing all sorts of things they didn’t want to do.” 

At the HAP, though, West’s motives were so vague that even his charm 
didn’t suffice. No one had a firm grasp of the project’s purpose—even those 
involved in it. The grad students hired to man West’s “crash pad” laboratory 
were assigned to keep diaries of their work. In unguarded moments, nearly all 
these students admitted that something didn’t add up. They weren’t sure what 
they were supposed to be doing, or why West was there. And often he wasn’t 
there. Unlike the grad students, he didn’t live at the pad. But he wasn’t 
putting in long hours at the HAFMC, either. Those who knew him at both 
places—and elsewhere in his long career—recalled his chronic absenteeism. 


One of the diaries in West’s files belonged to Kathy Collins, a Stanford 
psychology grad student who lived at the HAP pad that summer. The 
experience was a huge letdown for her, aimless to the point of worthlessness. 
She was getting paid to do nothing. When “crashers” showed up, “no one 
made much of a point of finding out about [them],” she put down in neat 
handwriting. More often, hippies failed to show up at all, since many of them 
apparently looked on the pad with suspicion. “What the hell have I gotten 
myself into and what the hell is Jolly doing, it is like a zoo. Is he studying us 
or them?” 

When West made one of his rare appearances, he was “dressed funny,” 
like a hippie; sometimes he would have friends in tow, costumed just as 
poorly. Collins wrote, “The rest of us tended to look to them in trying to 
understand what we were supposed to do or what Jolly wanted. Their general 
reply was that this was a good opportunity to have fun. I gather that they did. 
They spent a good deal of the time stoned.” 

Ennui set in. Hoping to feel useful, Collins and the others made inquiries 
about helping out at the HAFMC. They were swiftly rebuffed. Pressed for 
specific guidelines, West exuded “phoniness and dishonesty,” suggesting that 
the students answer sweeping, high-flown questions about the Haight, such as 
“Is this an asphalt Sherwood Forest?” She “got the impression that this 
question had already been answered.” 

At the height of her frustration, Collins wrote like someone trapped in an 
existentialist drama. “I really don’t know whether to laugh at Jolly or take 
him seriously,” she fumed. “I feel like no one is being honest and straight and 
the whole thing is a gigantic put on... What is he trying to prove? He is 
interested in drugs, that is clear. What else?” 


Brainwashing with the Love Drug 


Collins was right. West was interested in drugs. His professional fascination 
with LSD was practically as old as the substance itself, and he was one of an 
elite cadre of scientists using it in top-secret research. Lysergic acid 
diethylamide was synthesized in 1938 by chemists at Switzerland’s Sandoz 
Industries, but it was not introduced as a pharmaceutical until 1947. In the 
fifties, when the CIA began to experiment on humans with it, it was a very 


new substance. Be that as it may, the agency was not inclined to exercise 
caution. 

Almost right away, government scientists saw LSD as a potential Cold 
War miracle drug, the key to eradicating communism and seeding global 
democracy. Its effects on individual minds were extrapolated onto groups, 
voting blocs, and entire populations. Among psychiatrists, artists, and curious 
recreational users, LSD augured a different sort of liberty, but they, too, 
regarded it with awe. Albert Hofmann, the Swiss scientist who’d discovered 
its hallucinogenic qualities in 1943, described it as a “sacred drug” that 
gestured toward “the mystical experience of a deeper, comprehensive 
reality.” The actor Cary Grant, on the advice of his shrink, took some one 
hundred LSD trips during their weekly meetings in the late fifties, 
experiencing a “rebirth” and picturing himself “as a giant penis launching off 
from Earth like a spaceship.” 

Charles Fischer, a drug researcher who worked with David Smith, 
described to me the early perceptions of acid, when “trips” were planned like 
literal journeys. “Very few people took LSD without having somebody being 
a ‘trip leader,’” Fischer said. The suggestibility from LSD was akin to 
hypnosis—and Jolly West, of course, had known well enough to study the 
two in tandem. “You can tell somebody to hurt somebody, but you call it 
something else,” Fischer explained. “Hammer the nail into the wood, and the 
wood, perhaps, is a human being... [It] could result in some violent activity, 
even though LSD was considered a love drug.” 

The global superpowers considered it anything but. Full-fledged U.S. 
research into LSD began soon after the end of World War II, when American 
intelligence learned that the USSR was developing a program to influence 
human behavior through drugs and hypnosis. The United States believed that 
the Soviets could extract information from people without their knowledge, 
program them to make false confessions, and perhaps persuade them to kill 
on command. 

The CIA, then in its infancy, saw mind control as a natural extension of 
communism, spreading like fire where the forces of unreason prevailed. In 
1949 it launched Operation Bluebird, a mind-control program whose chipper 
name belied its brutal ambitions and its propensity for trampling on human 
rights. In its yen to best the Soviets, the CIA tested drugs on American 
citizens—most in federal penitentiaries or on military bases—who didn’t 


even know about, let alone consent to, the battery of procedures they 
underwent. 

Their abuse found further justification in 1952, when, in Korea, captured 
American pilots admitted on national radio that they’d sprayed the Korean 
countryside with illegal biological weapons. It was a confession so beyond 
the pale that the CIA blamed Communists: the POWs must have been 
“brainwashed.” The word, a literal translation of the Chinese xi nao, didn’t 
appear in English before 1950. It articulated a set of fears that had coalesced 
in postwar America. Soviets were using guile to force an evil philosophy on 
the world. Technology had destabilized every atom of human nature, and a 
new class of chemicals with unpronounceable names could reduce people to 
machines. The human mind, like any other appliance, could be rewired and 
automated. 

Once the Korean War was over and the American POWs returned, the 
army brought in a team of scientists to “deprogram” them. Among those 
scientists was a young psychiatrist from Cornell, Dr. Louis J. West. He would 
later claim to have studied eighty-three prisoners of war, fifty-six of whom 
had been forced to make false confessions. West interviewed them at length, 
undoing the treacheries of the “thought reform” they’d undergone in enemy 
hands. He and his colleagues were credited with reintegrating the POWs into 
Western society and, maybe more important, getting them to renounce their 
claims about having used biological weapons. 

West’s success with the POWs gained him entrée to the upper echelons of 
the intelligence community. As the Cold War bred paranoia, the CIA 
accelerated its mind-control efforts, and West, I learned, carved out a niche 
he’d occupy for decades to come. Initially, the agency wanted only to prevent 
further brainwashing by the Soviets. But the extraordinary power of 
psychotropic drugs, particularly LSD, was hard to ignore. Thus a defensive 
program became an offensive one. Operation Bluebird morphed into 
Operation Artichoke, a search for an all-purpose truth serum. 

Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, a poisons expert who headed the chemical division of 
the CIA’s Technical Services Staff, had convinced the agency’s director, 
Allen Dulles, that mind-control ops were the future. Gottlieb, whose aptitude 
and amorality had earned him the nickname the “Black Sorcerer,” developed 
gadgetry straight out of schlocky sci-fi: high-potency stink bombs, swizzle 
sticks laced with drugs, exploding seashells, poisoned toothpaste, poisoned 


handkerchiefs, poisoned cigars, poisoned anything. Mind control became 
Gottlieb’s pet project. Dulles, convinced that the American dream was at 
stake, ensured that Gottlieb was well funded. In a speech at Princeton 
University, Dulles warned that Communist spies could turn the American 
mind into “a phonograph playing a disc put on its spindle by an outside 
genius over which it has no control.” Just days after those remarks, on April 
13, 1953, he officially set Project MKULTRA into motion. 

The project’s broadest goal was “to influence human behavior.” Under its 
umbrella were 149 subprojects, many involving research that used unwitting 
participants. Having persuaded an Indianapolis pharmaceutical company to 
replicate the Swiss formula for LSD, the CIA had a limitless domestic supply 
of its favorite new drug. The agency hoped to produce couriers who could 
embed hidden messages in their brains, to implant false memories and 
remove true ones in people without their awareness, to convert groups to 
opposing ideologies, and more. The loftiest objective was the creation of 
hypno-programmed assassins. 

In their defense, CIA spooks weren’t above experimenting on themselves. 
The same substance that held the promise of controlling minds and quashing 
communism was used in churlish office pranks, with agents quietly slipping 
LSD into their colleagues’ drinks to achieve much needed “firsthand 
knowledge.” A plan to spike the punch bowl at the CIA Christmas party was 
quashed when higher-ups reminded the office that it could cause insanity. 

The most sensitive work was conducted far from Langley—farmed out to 
scientists at colleges, hospitals, prisons, and military bases all over the United 
States and Canada. The CIA gave these scientists aliases, funneled money to 
them, and instructed them on how to conceal their research from prying eyes, 
including those of their unknowing subjects. Feeling that it was their patriotic 
duty, the scientists accepted their secret missions in defiance of the 
Hippocratic oath: “First, do no harm.” 

In 1949, at the Nuremberg trials that adjudicated the crimes of World War 
II, the United States adopted the International Code for Human 
Experimentation: “A person must give full and informed consent before 
being used as a subject.” MKULTRA scientists flouted this code constantly, 
remorselessly—and in ways that stupefy the imagination. Their work 
encompassed everything from electronic brain stimulation to sensory 
deprivation to “induced pain” and “psychosis.” They sought ways to cause 


heart attacks, severe twitching, and intense cluster headaches. If drugs didn’t 
do the trick, they’d try to master ESP, ultrasonic vibrations, and radiation 
poisoning. One project tried to harness the power of magnetic fields. 

Operated on a strict need-to-know basis, MKULTRA was so highly 
classified that when John McCone succeeded Dulles as CIA director late in 
1961 he was not informed of its existence. Fewer than half a dozen agency 
brass were aware of MKULTRA at any period during its twenty-year history. 
When Gottlieb retired, in 1972 or ’73, the project retired with him. By then it 
had been pared down to almost nothing, as the agency focused on other ways 
to halt communism and sway policy making abroad and at home. 

Still, when the Watergate scandal, and the CIA’s involvement in it, 
consumed the nation in the early seventies, it occurred to agency leadership 
that it would be prudent to cover their tracks. Director Richard Helms ordered 
Gottlieb to destroy all MKULTRA files. In January 1973, the Technical 
Services Staff shredded countless documents describing the use of 
hallucinogens, including every known copy of a manual called “LSD: Some 
Un-Psychedelic Implications.” MKULTRA evaporated. 


Grandiose and Sinister 


In their haste to purge their misdeeds, the agents forgot about a cache of some 
sixteen thousand additional papers in an off-site warehouse. Even internally, 
those files would remain undiscovered for several years, but it was only a 
matter of time until the story broke; MKULTRA had become fodder for 
rumors around Washington. 

In December 1974, the project finally came to light in a terrific flash of 
headlines and intrigue. Seymour Hersh reported it on the front page of the 
New York Times: “Huge C.I.A. Operation Reported in U.S. Against Antiwar 
Forces.” Three government investigations followed, all hobbled by the CIA’s 
destruction of its files. When records were available, they were redacted; 
when witnesses were summoned, they were forgetful. 

First came the Church Committee and the Rockefeller Commission, each 
mentioned earlier regarding CHAOS and COINTELPRO. The Church 
Committee’s final report unveiled a 1957 internal evaluation of MKULTRA 
by the CIA’s inspector general. “Precautions must be taken,” the document 


warned, “to conceal these activities from the American public in general. The 
knowledge that the agency is engaging in unethical and illicit activities would 
have serious repercussions.” A 1963 review from the inspector general put it 
even more gravely: “A final phase of the testing of MKULTRA products 
places the rights and interests of U.S. citizens in jeopardy.” 

In fact, as the Church Committee’s report went on, MKULTRA had 
caused the deaths of at least two American citizens. One was a doctor who’d 
been injected with a synthetic mescaline derivative. The other was Frank 
Olson, a ClA-contracted scientist who’d been unwittingly dosed with LSD at 
a small agency gathering in the backwoods of Maryland presided over by 
Gottlieb himself. Olson fell into an irreparable depression afterward, which 
led him to hurl himself out the window of a New York City hotel where 
agents had brought him for “treatment.” (Continued investigation by Olson’s 
son, Eric, strongly suggests that the CIA arranged for the agents to fake his 
suicide; they threw him out of the window themselves out of fear that he 
would blow the whistle on MKULTRA and the military’s use of biological 
weapons in the Korean War.) 

The news of Olson’s death shocked a nation already reeling from 
Watergate, and now less inclined than ever to trust its institutions. The 
government tried to quell the controversy by passing new regulations on 
human experimentation. But scrutiny and internal pressure on the CIA 
continued to mount until the agency was forced to make an admission: It 
hadn’t destroyed everything. It had come to their attention that thousands of 
pages about MKULTRA were collecting dust in the off-site warehouse. 

So came another congressional investigation, more robust than the last, 
with sixteen thousand additional pages of documentation at its disposal. 
Senators Ted Kennedy and Daniel Inouye subpoenaed a number of CIA 
spooks. Among them was Gottlieb, rousted from his retirement in California 
and forced to defend his actions before the Senate. Or rather, before some of 
the Senate. Gottlieb claimed that his heart condition precluded the possibility 
of his addressing the whole chamber; instead, he was installed in an 
anteroom, where he answered questions from a select group while the masses 
listened over a public address system. 

As the New York Times pointed out, Gottlieb “managed to elude the lights 
and microphones and the crush of reporters waiting for him in the Senate 
hearing room.” He was spared the sight of the incredulity that spread over 


their faces as he admitted that he had destroyed MKULTRA’s files not to 
cover up “illegal activity,” but “because this material was sensitive and 
capable of being misunderstood.” He resented the harm done to his 
reputation, and he was loath to provide specifics about MKULTRA 
experiments, saying that he’d never witnessed any himself. 

Gottlieb’s destruction of the MKULTRA files was a federal crime. It was 
investigated by the Justice Department in 1976, but, according to the Times, 
“quietly dropped.” His brutal courses of experimentation broke any number 
of laws, and his perjury that day did, too. But he was never prosecuted. He’d 
testified before the Senate only under the condition that he receive total 
criminal immunity. 

As for those sixteen thousand new pages, they were mainly financial 
records, but a few more tantalizing documents found the CIA explicating its 
ambitions. “Can we obtain control of the future activities (physical and 
mental) of any individual, willing or unwilling... with a guarantee of 
amnesia?” they asked. “Can we force an individual to act against his own 
moral concepts?” And: “Can an individual... be made to perform an act of 
attempted assassination?” 

Senate investigators condemned MKULTRA unanimously. Kennedy 
branded it “perverse” and “corrupt,” an erosion of the “freedom of 
individuals and institutions in the name of national security.” Inouye called it 
“grandiose and sinister.” The CIA’s new director, Stansfield Turner, swore 
that he’d sent all existing MKULTRA files to the Justice Department, which 
would mount a thorough investigation. 

Still, between the destruction of records and the subpoenaed agents’ 
sudden memory lapses, everyone knew that “the full facts,” as the New York 
Times editorialized, “may never come out.” The Senate demanded the 
formation of a federal program to locate the victims of MKULTRA 
experiments, and to pursue criminal charges against the perpetrators. That 
program never coalesced. Surviving records named eighty institutions, 
including forty-four universities and colleges, and 185 researchers, among 
them Louis J. West. The New York Times identified him, in a front-page lead 
story, no less, as one of seven suspected scientists who’d secretly participated 
in MKULTRA under academic cover. And yet not one researcher was ever 
federally investigated, and only two victims were ever notified. The Times 
had called MKULTRA “a secret twenty-five year, twenty-five million dollar 


effort by the CIA to learn how to control the human mind.” It looked like no 
one would suffer any consequences for it. 

Griffin Bell, the Attorney General at the time of the revelations, told me 
the files never arrived at the Justice Department, despite Stansfield Turner’s 
sworn Claim to the contrary. Bell said they must’ve just “fall[en] through the 
cracks.” As for Turner himself, he told me he could no longer remember 
having testified that the CIA sent the files. “I’m just drawing a total blank 
here,” he said. I read his remarks back to him. “I guess I did testify about 
this,” he said. “Somebody fed me the stuff and I played it back.” 

The New York Times ran twenty-seven stories on MKULTRA, eight on 
the front page. But no one in the press corps, and none of the senators 
involved, followed up to see that the promised investigations took place. 
Since then, the program’s bewildering significance has been engulfed many 
times over by other controversies. Receding in the rearview mirror, it looks 
like just another example of the CIA’s megalomania at the zenith of the Cold 
War. 


Jolly West, CIA Asset 


When I started visiting the UCLA library, I had no idea that Jolly West had 
created a “laboratory disguised as a hippie crash pad” in the Haight. I’d found 
early research papers of his, but not much else. And for a long while, my 
days in the library were fruitless. West’s archive comprised two hundred 
boxes, most of them full of ephemera. There were tons of press clippings. 
West had tracked the media’s coverage of assassinations, the CIA, aggression 
in cats, psychosurgery, capital punishment, alcoholism among Native 
Americans, behavior modification, and the civil rights movement, among 
other subjects. I was intrigued to see many clippings on the Manson murders, 
and papers by Roger Smith, David Smith, and Alan Rose. 

Part of the reason that West became my white whale was that, improbably 
enough, Pd already interviewed him once in 1995, a few years before his 
death, when I was still reporting celebrity features for Us and Premiere. I was 
doing a piece on the uptick in celebrity stalkers, and West was one of the 
scientific “experts” I consulted. When I’d spoken with psychiatrists before, I 
was the one who did all the talking—this time it was all West, who droned on 


for so long that I cut the interview short. 

Now that felt like a lifetime ago. As I settled in for the long haul at the 
library, my early certainty began to falter. My first visit had been on June 12, 
2001. I’d leave the campus every evening wondering if I was wasting my 
time, having found nothing and gotten no closer to wrapping up my 
reporting. The basement of the library came to feel like my underground 
bunker. More than two months went by. I kept sifting and taking notes. On 
August 25, among a batch of research papers on hypnosis, I found them: 
letters between West and his CIA handler, “Sherman Grifford.” 

I didn’t recognize the name, so as soon as I got home, I began tearing 
through every book I had that mentioned MKULTRA, hoping that it would 
jump out at me. In the first and most definitive of the bunch, John Marks’s 
The Search for the Manchurian Candidate, there it was, buried in a footnote: 
“CIA operators and agents all had cover names,” it said, “even in classified 
documents. Gottlieb was ‘Sherman R. Grifford.’” 

So West really had lied all those years. Not only was he a part of 
MKULTRA, he’d corresponded with the “Black Sorcerer” of MKULTRA 
himself. Preserved in his files, the letters picked up midstream, with no 
prologue or preliminaries. The first one was dated June 11, 1953, a mere two 
months after MKULTRA started. West was then chief of psychiatric service 
at the airbase at Lackland, Texas. 

Addressing Gottlieb as “S.G.,” he outlined the experiments he proposed to 
perform using a combination of psychotropic drugs and hypnosis. 
Enumerating short- and long-term goals, he offered a nine-point list, 
beginning with a plan to discover “the degree to which information can be 
extracted from presumably unwilling subjects (through hypnosis alone or in 
combination with certain drugs), possibly with subsequent amnesia for the 
interrogation and/or alteration of the subject’s recollection of the information 
he formerly knew.” Another item proposed honing “techniques for 
implanting false information into particular subjects... or for inducing in 
them specific mental disorders.” West wanted to reverse someone’s belief 
system without his knowledge, and make it stick. He hoped to create 
“couriers” who would carry “a long and complex message” embedded 
secretly in their minds, and to study “the induction of trance-states by drugs.” 
All of these were the goals of MKULTRA, and they bore a striking 
resemblance to Manson’s accomplishments with his followers more than a 


decade later. 

“Needless to say,” West added, the experiments “must eventually be put 
to test in practical trials in the field.” 

West’s colleagues wouldn’t approve of his activities. He yearned to “cut 
down considerably the number of people who can properly call me to 
account.” Because he’d be using drugs that were “not on the Air Force list of 
standard preparations,” he wanted to secure “some sort of carte blanche.” 
(He would go on to suggest a number of security measures in his letters, 
including disguised funding, double envelopes, and false names.) 

Next West addressed a sensitive matter: who would the guinea pigs be? 
He listed four groups—basic airmen, volunteers, patients, and “others, 
possibly including prisoners in the local stockade.” Only the volunteers 
would be paid. The others could be unwilling, and, though it wasn’t spelled 
out, unwitting. Itd be easier to preserve his secrecy if he was “inducing 
specific mental disorders” in people who already exhibited them. “Certain 
patients requiring hypnosis in therapy, or suffering from dissociative 
disorders (trances, fugues, amnesias, etc.) might lend themselves to our 
experiments.” 

As if to prove his thoroughness, he affixed two addenda to his four-page 
letter, begging Gottlieb to get one of his superiors, a Major Robert Williams, 
“transferred to another base.” Williams was “an uncomfortably close 
scrutinizer of all my activities” who believed that hypnosis was “tampering 
with the soul,” West complained. 


Gottlieb’s reply came on letterhead from “Chemrophyl Associates,” a front 
company he used to correspond with MKULTRA subcontractors. “My Good 
Friend,” he wrote, “I had been wondering whether your apparent rapid and 
comprehensive grasp of our problems could possibly be real... you have 
indeed developed an admirably accurate picture of exactly what we are after. 
For this I am deeply grateful.” He would arrange top-secret clearances for 
anyone who might become ensnared in their work, giving West “a separate 
sum” for the purchase of materials. 

Gottlieb saluted his new recruit: “We have developed quite an asset in the 
relationship we are developing with you.” 

West returned the camaraderie. “It makes me very happy to realize that 


you consider me ‘an asset,’” he replied. “Surely there is no more vital 
undertaking conceivable in these times.” 

With that, the record of their correspondence ceased for nearly nine 
months. When it resumed, in April 1954, West had begun arrangements to 
relocate to the University of Oklahoma School of Medicine, which wanted 
him to head its psychiatry department. He would be a civilian again. Gottlieb 
commended his “new look,” noting, “it appears at the moment to be a move 
which would in the long run be beneficial for us.” He signed off intimately, 
“Give my regards to your family.” 

West had lied to his prospective employer, writing, “My present job is 
purely clinical and I have been doing no research, classified or otherwise.” 
The university took him at his word. Now performing his duties for Gottlieb 
at both the university and the air force base, West asked the judge advocate at 
Lackland for permission to accept money from the Geschickter Fund for 
Medical Research, which he called “a non-profit private research 
foundation.” In fact, as the CIA later acknowledged, Geschickter was another 
of Gottlieb’s fictions, enabling him to keep West and other researchers 
properly paid. 

By April 1955, West had moved permanently to Oklahoma City. But the 
air force insisted he return to Lackland weekly to serve out the remainder of 
his contract. Gottlieb, who’d evidently attempted to pull some strings, wrote 
in September 1954 to relay some frustrating news: “The Air Force will not 
release you... Although this rather adequately stops our present effort, it does 
not erase the need for research in the field. I’m suggesting therefore that you 
give some thought to the period some 20 months hence and the plans which 
might be made in the interim.” 

Twenty months would’ve put them in April 1956. That year, West 
reported back to the CIA that the experiments he’d begun in 1953 had at last 
come to fruition. He was ensconced in a civilian institution, and evidently he 
found it a less oppressive setting than Lackland had been. In a paper titled 
“The Psychophysiological Studies of Hypnosis and Suggestibility,” he 
claimed to have achieved the impossible: he knew how to replace “true 
memories” with “false ones” in human beings without their knowledge. In 
case the CIA didn’t grasp the significance of this, he put it in layman’s terms: 
“Tt has been found to be feasible to take the memory of a definite event in the 
life of an individual and, through hypnotic suggestion, bring about the 


subsequent conscious recall to the effect that this event never actually took 
place, but that a different (fictional) event actually did occur.” 

The document, marked “classified,” was right there in West’s files; I had 
to assume that the CIA had destroyed any copies. They’ve never publicly 
acknowledged West’s groundbreaking deed. He’d done it, he claimed, by 
administering “new drugs” effective in “speeding the induction of the 
hypnotic state and in deepening the trance that can be produced in given 
subjects.” 

As in his initial experiments, West performed most of these psychiatric 
feats on mental health patients. “The necessity to obtain most of the subject 
material from a population of psychiatry patients made standardized 
observations very difficult,” he groused. In the report, which doubled as a 
request for continued funding—a successful request; West received 
government backing through 1965 at the least—he enthusiastically described 
a high-tech laboratory he planned to construct at Oklahoma. It would include 
“a special chamber [where] various hypnotic, pharmacologic, and sensory- 
environmental variables will be manipulated.” 

West had hypnotized mental patients and “normal subjects” and exposed 
them to a host of drugs, including chlorpromazine, reserpine, amphetamines, 
and LSD—the same ones that David Smith would inject in his confined 
rodents about a decade later. Of course, at least two of these, LSD especially, 
would prove instrumental in the Manson Family’s group psychology. 

But when it came to elaborating on his findings about implanting 
memories and controlling thoughts, West skimped on the details. He seemed 
to have been in a rudimentary phase of his research. Acid, he wrote, made 
people more difficult to hypnotize; it was better to pair hypnosis with long 
bouts of isolation and sleep deprivation. Using hypnotic suggestion, he 
claimed, “a person can be told that it is now a year later and during the course 
of this year many changes have taken place... so that it is now acceptable for 
him to discuss matters that he previously felt he should not discuss... An 
individual who insists he desires to do one thing will reveal that secretly he 
wishes just the opposite.” 

Since West’s paper was light on specifics, it’s hard to know if it was only 
a ploy for more funding. Whatever it was, the CIA felt it had to keep it under 
wraps. When the agency was forced to disclose MKULTRA to the public, 
they submitted an expurgated version of West’s paper to Congress, an act of 


deception that’s never been exposed. At the National Security Archives in 
D.C., I found the version of “The Psychophysiological Studies of Hypnosis 
and Suggestibility” that the CIA had turned over to the Senate. West’s name 
and affiliation were redacted, as expected. But what shocked me was that the 
Senate’s version didn’t include West’s nine-page attachment, but rather an 
unsigned summary. There was no mention of Wests triumphant 
accomplishment, the replacement of “the memory of a definite event in the 
life of an individual” with a “fictional event.” 

In sworn testimony, the CIA said that everything it shared with Congress 
was intact except for the redactions of researchers’ and institutions’ names. 
Now it turned out they hadn’t just censored West’s report; they’d completely 
misrepresented its contents. The one-page summary of West’s 
accomplishments in the lab doesn’t exist in West’s original. The new page 
was only a theoretical discussion of LSD—of its possible effects on 
“dissociative states.” It concluded, “The effects of these agents [LSD and 
other drugs] upon the production, maintenance, and manifestations of 
disassociated states has never been studied.” 

West, of course, had studied those effects for years and years. I could only 
conclude that the CIA misrepresented the original document to mislead the 
Senate committee, thus striking West’s research from the official record. As 
was my habit whenever I found hard evidence of a cover-up, I started 
dwelling on one question after another. Didn’t this counterfeit paper cast 
doubt on the entire cache of documents released to the Senate in 1977? If 
West’s authentic paper had been so fuzzy about the effects of drugs, 
including LSD, on dissociative states, why had the CIA felt the need to 
generate a fake version? 

Maybe because West had achieved one of MKULTRA’s most coveted 
goals. Despite testimony to the contrary, the CIA had, in fact, learned how to 
manipulate people’s memories without their knowledge. Agency officials 
claimed the program had been a colossal failure, leading newspapers to run 
mocking headlines like “The Gang That Couldn’t Spray Straight.” It could’ve 
been exactly what the agency wanted—for the world to assume MKULTRA 
was a bust, and forget the whole thing. One thing was indisputable: The 
CIA’s falsified documents invalidated the Senate investigation’s findings. 
The agency lied, obstructed justice, and tampered with evidence, and the 
West documents prove it. 


Given the furtive nature of his research, West could be surprisingly garrulous. 
Among the press clippings in his file were two items from Portland, Oregon, 
newspapers, both dated October 1963—the murky period between his 
Oklahoma hypnosis studies and the Haight-Ashbury Project. West had given 
an address to the Mental Health Association of Oregon, letting it slip that he 
was inducing insanity in the lab. He framed these studies as positive 
developments: they might someday cure mental illness. 

“We are at the dawning of a new era,” West told the crowd, “learning for 
the first time to produce temporary mental derangement in the laboratory.” 
The Oregon Journal noted that West “listed the new hallucination drug LSD, 
along with other drugs, hypnosis, and sleep deprivation as some of the things 
that [he was] using to produce temporary mental illness effects in normal 
people.” Reporting that West had done “extensive work” with LSD, the 
Journal continued: “The most important contribution of the drug so far is in 
producing model mental illnesses.” 

Almost fifteen years later, besieged by reporters after the New York Times 
alleged that he’d taken part in MKULTRA’s secret LSD experimentation 
program, West insisted that all of his LSD work “had been confined to 
animals,” denying any CIA affiliation. When reporters pointed out that he’d 
received an awful lot of money from the agency, he retorted that he’d had no 
idea that the Geschickter Fund and other sources were CIA fronts. Legally, 
the CIA was obligated to tell the University of Oklahoma that one of its 
faculty had been on the agency payroll. Oklahoma revealed a heavily 
redacted memo saying that an unnamed professor—West, I confirmed 
through financial records—had been investigating “a number of dissociative 
phenomena” on humans “in the lab,” including an exceptionally rare clinical 
disorder known as “latah,” “a neurotic condition marked by automatic 
obedience.” 

None of the allegations harmed West’s reputation. By then he’d left 
Oklahoma for UCLA, where he offered a steady stream of denials and 
continued to thrive through his retirement in 1988. Irascible and arrogant, he 
was quick to threaten lawsuits when anyone brought up the charges. 
Sometimes he threw in diversionary tactics: in a 1991 rebuttal, he claimed, 
“My secret connection to Washington, D.C. is not as a spook, but rather as a 


confidential advisor to Presidents... From Eisenhower to Bush, Democrat 
and Republican Presidents alike have freely sought and received my 
counsel.” In a 1993 letter to the editor of the UCLA Bruin, he had the 
temerity to compare his accusers to Nazi propagandists “in Goebbels’ 
tradition of the Big Lie.” West added, “I have never taken part in ‘mind- 
control’ experiments funded by the CIA or anybody else”: a statement belied 
by his own files. 


The Misadventures of Jolly West 


Even before his CIA connections came out, West’s experiments got him in 
plenty of trouble. In 1972, he announced plans to build a lab in an abandoned 
Nike Missile base in the Santa Monica Mountains. He would call it “The 
Center for the Study and Reduction of Violence,” or the Violence Center, for 
short. There, in perfect isolation, he could study the origins and control of 
human violence by experimenting on prisoners. Governor Ronald Reagan 
gave the Violence Center a full-throated endorsement. 

But West’s proposal for grant money landed him in hot water. He planned 
to test radical forms of behavior modification, implanting electrodes and 
“remote monitoring devices” in prisoners’ brains. A federal investigation 
concluded that the program involved “coercive methods” that threatened 
“privacy and self-determination.” 

The committee’s disclosures stymied the Violence Center before it got 
past the planning stages. The California legislature vetoed the project; 
UCLA’s student body rose up in protest of West. And this, to reiterate, was 
before anyone had a clue about his CIA work. 

Now I could tie West to the highest, most clandestine echelons of the 
Central Intelligence Agency. I could tie him to both of the Smiths, the 
authority figures from Manson’s lost year in San Francisco. And through his 
efforts to open the Violence Center, I could tie him to bigwigs in the LAPD 
and the DA’s office who’d helped to prosecute Manson. But I could never 
prove that he’d examined Manson himself—or even that they’d ever met. 
Nor had West taken part in Manson’s trial. His absence was conspicuous. 
One of the world’s leading experts on brainwashing and cults, he was hardly 
averse to publicity. He’d appeared as a witness many times before. Manson 


was tried in his own backyard; the proceedings were international news. Yet 
West went nowhere near them. 

I told David Smith about the CIA’s research and its parallels with 
Manson: the agency had wanted to accomplish exactly what Manson 
succeeded in doing with the girls. I was wondering whether someone in the 
CIA influenced Manson while he was in San Francisco. 

“I don’t know,” he said, “but the military experiments are added proof 
that my hypothesis is correct—that it can be done.” 

“That you can brainwash with LSD?” 

He nodded. 

“The CIA maintained that they never were able to accomplish it,” I said. 

“In part because they were basically taking normal subjects,” he said, “not 
susceptible girls in a reinforcing environment.” When he’d evaluated Susan 
Atkins for a parole hearing ten years after she’d separated from Manson, she 
was still under his control. “I can’t get him out of my head!” she told him. 
“He’s still in my brain!” 

But was brainwashing really even possible? I’d always believed that Cold 
War-era paranoia had overstated the potential for “Manchurian Candidates” 
taught to kill by dastardly commies. On the other hand, I accepted that 
Charles Manson had altered his followers’ minds, and that LSD did a lot of 
the heavy lifting. He’d seemed to have an endless supply of the drug, though 
no one said how he got it. Plus, he was so often described as “hypnotic.” Ed 
Sanders had written in The Family of a hypnotist, William Deanyer, who 
managed a Sunset Strip club and alleged that he’d taught Manson how to 
hypnotize. It seemed dubious. But I confirmed that Deanyer had learned 
hypnosis in the navy. And his daughter told me she’d seen her father teaching 
Manson at the club. 

With Alan Scheflin, a forensic psychologist and law professor who’d 
written a book on MKULTRA, I laid out a circumstantial case linking West 
to Manson. Was it possible, I asked, that the Manson murders were an 
MKULTRA experiment gone wrong? “No,” he said, “an MKULTRA 
experiment gone right.” 

In the back of my mind was the most confounding passage in Helter 
Skelter—one that I’d underlined, highlighted, and finally torn out and taped 
above my computer. “The most puzzling question of all,” Bugliosi wrote, 
was how Manson had turned his docile followers into remorseful killers. 


Even with the LSD, the sex, the isolation, the sleep deprivation, the social 
abandonment, there had to be “some intangible quality... It may be 
something that he learned from others.” Something that he learned from 
others. Those had become the six most pivotal words in the book for me. 

I was more compelled than ever to peel back every layer of West’s past, 
hoping that some tie to Manson would come out, or that I’d get the name of 
someone who knew the name of someone who could confirm that the two 
had met. On the way, I discovered some fearsome episodes from West’s past. 
As a self-styled brainwashing expert, he’d been present whenever mind 
control reared its ugly head in American culture. Murders, assassinations, 
kidnappings, cults, prisoners of war—his fingerprints were on all of them. 


The Curious Case of Jimmy Shaver 


After midnight on July 4, 1954, a three-year-old girl named Chere Jo Horton 
disappeared outside the Lackland Air Force Base, where Jolly West was 
stationed. Horton’s parents had left her in the parking lot outside a bar; she 
played with her brother while they had a drink inside. When they noticed her 
missing, they formed a search party. 

Within an hour of Horton’s disappearance, the party came upon a car with 
her underwear hanging from the door. They heard shouting nearby. Two 
construction workers had been napping in a nearby gravel pit when a 
Lackland airman wandered out of the darkness. He was shirtless, covered in 
blood and scratches. Making no attempt to escape, he let the search party 
walk him to the edge of the highway. Bystanders described him as “dazed” 
and “trance-like.” 

“What’s going on here?” he asked. He didn’t seem drunk, but he couldn’t 
say where he was, how he’d gotten there, or whose blood was all over him. 
Meanwhile, the search party found Horton’s body in the gravel pit. Her neck 
was broken, her legs had been torn open, and she’d been raped. Deputies 
arrested the man. 

His name was Jimmy Shaver. At twenty-nine, he was recently remarried, 
with two children, no criminal record, no history of violence. He’d been at 
the same bar Horton had been abducted from, but he’d left with a friend, who 
told police that neither of them was drunk, though Shaver seemed high on 


something. Before deputies could take Shaver to the county jail, a constable 
from another precinct arrived with orders from military police to assume 
custody of him. 

Around four that morning, an air force marshal questioned Shaver and 
two doctors examined him, agreeing he wasn’t drunk. One later testified that 
he “was not normal... he was very composed outside, which I did not expect 
him to be under these circumstances.” He was released to the county jail and 
booked for rape and murder. 

Investigators interrogated Shaver through the morning. When his wife 
came to visit, he didn’t recognize her. He gave his first statement at 10:30 
a.m., adamant that another man was responsible: he could summon an image 
of a stranger with blond hair and tattoos. After the air force marshal returned 
to the jailhouse, however, Shaver signed a second statement taking full 
responsibility. Though he still didn’t remember anything, he reasoned that he 
must have done it. 

Two months later, in September, Shaver’s memories still hadn’t returned. 
The base hospital commander told Jolly West to perform an evaluation: was 
he legally sane at the time of the murder? Shaver spent the next two weeks 
under West’s supervision, subject to copious psychological tests. They 
returned to the scene of the crime, trying to jog his memory. Later, West 
hypnotized Shaver and gave him an injection of sodium pentothal, “truth 
serum,” to see if he could clear his amnesia. 

While Shaver was under—with West injecting more truth serum to 
“deepen the trance”—Shaver recalled the events of that night. He confessed 
to killing Horton. She’d brought out repressed memories of his cousin, “Beth 
Rainboat,” who’d sexually abused him as a child. Shaver had started drinking 
at home that night when he “had visions of God, who whispered into his ear 
to seek out and kill the evil girl Beth.” (This “Beth” was never sought for 
questioning.) At the trial, West argued that Shaver’s truth-serum confession 
was more valid than any other. And West was testifying for the defense— 
they’d hoped he could get an acquittal on temporary insanity. 

Instead, West’s testimony helped the prosecution. Here was a psychiatric 
expert who believed wholeheartedly that Shaver had committed the crime, 
and who’d gotten him to admit it in colorful detail. While West maintained 
that the airman had suffered a bout of temporary insanity, he also said that 
Shaver was “quite sane now.” In the courtroom, he didn’t look that way. One 


newspaper account said he “sat through the strenuous sessions like a man in a 
trance,” saying nothing, never rising to stretch or smoke, though he was a 
known chain-smoker. “Some believe it’s an act,” the paper said, “others 
believe his demeanor is real.” 


West often treated Lackland airmen for neurological disorders. During the 
trial, it came out that Shaver had suffered from migraines so debilitating that 
he’d dunk his head in a bucket of ice water when he felt one coming on. He 
sought regular treatment, and the air force had recommended him for a two- 
year experimental program. The doctor who’d attempted to recruit him was 
never named. 

Shaver’s medical history was scrutinized at trial, but little mention was 
made of the base hospital, Wilford Hall, where West had conducted his 
MKULTRA experiments on unwitting patients. On the stand, West said he’d 
never gotten around to seeing whether Shaver had been treated there. I 
checked—Lackland officials told me there was no record of him in their 
master index of patients. But, curiously, all the records for patients in 1954 
had been maintained, with one exception: the file for last names beginning 
with “Sa” through “St” had vanished. 

Articles and court testimony described Shaver’s mental state just as West 
had described his experiments the previous summer: amnesias and trance 
states, a man violating his moral code with no memory of doing so. And 
West had written that he planned to experiment on Lackland airmen for 
projects that “must eventually be put to test in practical trials in the field.” 

This was all the more difficult to ignore after I got the transcript of 
Shaver’s truth-serum interview. West had used leading questions to walk the 
entranced Shaver through the crime. “Tell me about when you took your 
clothes off, Jimmy,” he said. And trying to prove that Shaver had repressed 
memories: “Jimmy, do you remember when something like this happened 
before?” Or: “After you took her clothes off what did you do?” 

“T never did take her clothes off,” Shaver said. 

The interview was divided into thirds. The middle third, for some reason, 
wasn’t recorded. When the record picked up, the transcript said, “Shaver is 
crying. He has been confronted with all the facts repeatedly.” 

West asked, “Now you remember it all, don’t you, Jimmy?” 


“Yes, sir,” Shaver replied. 

For West, this seems to have been business as usual, but it left an indelible 
mark on the psychiatrists who worked with him. One of them, Gilbert Rose, 
was so baffled by the Shaver case that he went on to write a play about it. 
When I reached Rose by phone in 2002, he said Shaver still haunted him. 

“In my fifty years in the profession,” he said of the truth-serum interview, 
“that was the most dramatic moment ever—when he clapped his hands to his 
face and remembered killing the girl.” But Rose was shocked when I told him 
that West had hypnotized Shaver in addition to giving him sodium pentothal. 
After I read Rose citations from articles, reports, and the transcript, he 
seemed to accept it, but he was adamant that West had never said anything— 
hypnotism was not part of the protocol. 

He’d also never known how West had found out about the case right 
away. 

“We were involved from the first day,” Rose recalled. “Jolly phoned me 
the morning of the murder,” Rose said, giving me flashbacks to Shahrokh 
Hatami’s memory of Reeve Whitson. “He initiated it.” 

West may have shielded himself from scrutiny, but he made only a 
minimal effort to exonerate Shaver. The airman was found guilty. Though an 
appeals court ruled that he’d had an unfair trial, he was convicted again in the 
retrial. In 1958, on his thirty-third birthday, he was executed by the electric 
chair. He maintained his innocence the whole time. 

West claimed he was in the courtroom the day Shaver was sentenced to 
death. Around this time, he became vehemently against capital punishment. I 
couldn’t help but wonder if it was because he knew his experiments might’ve 
led to the execution of an innocent man and the death of a child. What if his 
correspondence with Gottlieb, predating the crime by just a year, had been 
presented at trial? Would the outcome have been the same? 


Tusko Goes Down 


If the Shaver incident was the most harrowing chapter of West’s career, the 
most surreal belonged to Tusko: an elephant. Of all West’s experiments, this 
one netted the most press, much of it scathing. But the public didn’t know 
that the CIA’s Sidney Gottlieb had funded it. 


On August 2, 1962, West headed to Oklahoma City’s Lincoln Park Zoo, 
where he’d invited a crowd of eager onlookers to watch his latest test. To 
their delight, he’d secured an Asian elephant named Tusko, an exotic 
specimen in Oklahoma. West would attempt, he explained, to induce musth, 
“a form of madness” that occurred in male elephants during the rutting 
season. Musth caused violent behavioral changes. “Normally cooperative and 
tamable, the elephant now runs berserk for a period of about two weeks, 
during which time he may attack or destroy anything in his path,” West 
explained, claiming that whole villages had been wiped out by a single 
musthing animal. In his rage, the elephant secreted “a mysterious fluid,” 
brown and sticky, from his temporal gland. Could it prove medically useful? 
He intended to find out. His method was simple: he would simulate musth by 
injecting the elephant with a lot of LSD. 

But West had miscalculated the dosage. Tusko weighed a whopping 7000 
pounds. West shot him with 2800 milligrams of acid, about 1400 times the 
quantity given to a human to produce “a marked mental disturbance,” by 
West’s measurement. “Five minutes after the injection,” West later wrote, 
“Tusko trumpeted, collapsed, fell heavily onto his right side, defecated and 
went into status epilepticus,” a respiratory seizure resulting in death. 

The next morning’s paper featured a front-page photo of the portly 
psychiatrist bent over the deceased pachyderm. There were no animal-rights 
groups then—Tusko’s death was received more as comedy than tragedy. For 
a time, West became the laughingstock of the scientific community, and he 
was soon making fun of the mishap himself; he liked to inform his lecture 
audiences that he was the doctor famous for killing an elephant with LSD. 
When I asked Roger Smith about West, he exclaimed, “He’s the guy that 
killed the elephant. Great story. Wonderful story. He always told it!” 

The mystery behind the joke was why LSD had been used on an elephant 
in the first place. What good did it do to simulate musth? West, true to form, 
never gave the same explanation twice. Speaking to an interviewer from the 
Medical Tribune, and to another from the Daily Oklahoman, West said his 
objective was to find an “animal model” for “recurring psychoses in 
humans.” Elephant brains were useful analogs for the human mind: they had 
excellent memories, “creative judgment,” sophisticated problem-solving 
abilities, and even an “individual personality.” Looking at elephant violence 
offered an opportunity “to learn what changes are correlated with this gross 


behavior,” and to see if those changes happened in people, too. 

And yet in a December 1962 article for the journal Science, West and his 
coresearcher acted as if their ambitions were purely zoological. If they 
surgically removed an elephant’s glands before puberty, “he might grow up 
to be a sexually capable but behaviorally tractable animal.” 

Their recommendations were so preposterous that they occasioned an 
avalanche of letters to Science. Outraged scientists questioned West’s true 
objectives, labeling him “capricious” and “irresponsible.” “I fail to see any 
scientific merit,” one wrote, “or purpose.” 

West left his position at the University of Oklahoma in January 1969. His 
successor, Dr. Gordon Deckert, found records in the department’s files about 
the Tusko debacle. “When [the elephant] died, the department was worried: 
How in the world are we going to pay for that?” Deckert recalled. “All Jolly 
would say to anybody was that he would find a way to pay for it. I learned 
then, when I became chair, that the source was payment from the CIA.” 
Having known about West’s involvement in “the so-called brainwashing 
issue in the Korean War,” Deckert conceded that he “wasn’t terribly 
surprised.” The financial cover was the Foundations Fund for Research in 
Psychiatry, Inc.: the same group that paid for West’s Haight-Ashbury Project. 


Jack Ruby’s Psychotic Break 


At UCLA, I kept requesting boxes of West’s papers, and they kept leading 
me over trapdoors. Next they dropped me into a quagmire I wanted no part 
of: the assassination of John F. Kennedy, an event that plausibly qualified as 
the most discussed crime of all time. Certainly it had bred more conspiracy 
theories, skepticism, and enmity than any other incident in U.S. history, 
altering the way Americans digested their news, and breaking the nation’s 
belief in its institutions. I flipped through West’s pages cautiously, hoping 
that his involvement was peripheral. It wasn’t. Down through the trapdoor I 
went. 

Kennedy was shot as his motorcade passed through Dallas’s Dealey Plaza 
on November 22, 1963. Two days later, at the Dallas police headquarters, 
officers escorted Kennedy’s assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, to an armored car 
that would drive him to the county jail. A man stepped out from the crowd 


and aimed a revolver at Oswald’s chest. It was Jack Ruby, a nightclub 
proprietor with connections to Cuban political groups and organized crime. 
He fired once at point-blank range, sending a fatal bullet into Oswald’s 
stomach. 

According to a first-person account that Ruby produced with a ghostwriter 
—published in newspapers in a scenario close to Susan Atkins’s, and again 
involving Lawrence Schiller—Ruby “lost [his] senses” when he pulled out 
his gun. Next thing he knew, the cops had him pinned to the floor, and he had 
no memory of what he’d just done. “What am I doing here?” he asked. “What 
are you guys jumping on me for?” A psychiatric analysis solicited by Ruby’s 
defense attorneys said he’d suffered “a ‘fugue state’ with subsequent 
amnesia.” 

On the advice of his attorney at the time, Ruby said he’d murdered 
Oswald to spare the widowed First Lady, Jackie Kennedy, the ordeal of 
testifying against Oswald at trial. Another of Ruby’s attorneys, Melvin Belli, 
later wrote that Ruby had “a blank spot in his memory,” and that any 
explanation he provided was simply “confabulating.” Potential justifications 
“had been poured like water into the vacuum in his pathologically receptive 
memory and, once there, had solidified like cement.” 

Seemingly as soon as the story of Oswald’s murder hit the presses, Jolly 
West tried to insinuate himself into the case. He hoped to assemble a panel of 
“experts in behavior problems” to weigh in on Ruby’s mental state. He took 
the extraordinary measure of approaching Judge Joe B. Brown, who’d 
impaneled the grand jury that indicted Ruby. West wanted the judge to 
appoint him to the case. At that time, police hadn’t revealed any substantial 
information about Ruby, his psychological condition, or his possible motive. 
And West was vague about his motive, too. Three documents among his 
papers said he’d been “asked” by someone, though he never said who, to seek 
the appointment from Brown “a few days after the assassination,” a fact 
never before made public. 

The judge turned him down. For the moment, it seemed, West would be 
getting nowhere near Ruby, who was soon convicted of first-degree murder 
and sentenced to death. Ruby was reportedly unmoored by the news. He’d 
killed the president’s assassin, and the citizens of Dallas had rewarded him 
with a trip to the gallows. He fired his attorney and hired Hubert Winston 
Smith, a psychiatrist with a law degree who’d assisted in the trial, to 


represent him on appeal. 

Meanwhile, at Langley, the CIA’s Richard Helms was making the case 
that MKULTRA’s human guinea pigs had to be entirely unaware of the 
experiments performed on them. This was “the only realistic method,” he 
wrote, “to influence human behavior as the operational targets will certainly 
be unwitting.” 

Once Dr. Smith was driving Ruby’s legal team, one of his first acts was to 
request a new psychiatric examination of Ruby. He had one candidate in 
mind: Dr. Louis Jolyon West, whom he noted in a court brief had enjoyed 
acclaim for his studies of brainwashed American POWs. Perhaps, Smith 
wrote, West could use his “highly qualified” skills as a hypnotist and an 
administrator of the “truth serum, sodium pentothal” to help Ruby regain his 
memory of the shooting. (West may have rewarded Smith for the plum 
assignment by helping him land a teaching position at Oklahoma.) 

And so, on April 26, 1964, West boarded a plane bound for Dallas. He 
was scheduled to examine Jack Ruby in the county jail that afternoon. 


The Dallas papers reported it in their final editions that evening: West 
emerged from Ruby’s cell to announce that the previously sane inmate had 
undergone “an acute psychotic break” sometime during the preceding “forty- 
eight hours.” Whatever transpired between West and Ruby in that cell, only 
the two of them could say; there were no witnesses. West asserted that Ruby 
“was now positively insane.” The condition appeared to be “unshakable” and 
“fixed.” 

In a sworn affidavit accompanying his diagnosis, West described a 
completely unhinged man who hallucinated, heard voices, and had suddenly 
acquired the unshakeable belief that a new holocaust was under way in 
America. “Last night,” West wrote, “the patient became convinced that all 
Jews in America were being slaughtered. This was in retaliation for him, Jack 
Ruby, the Jew who was responsible for ‘all the trouble.’” The delusions were 
so real that Ruby had crawled under the table to hide from the killers. He said 
he’d “seen his own brother tortured, horribly mutilated, castrated, and burned 
in the street outside the jail. He could still hear the screams... The orders for 
this terrible ‘pogrom’ must have come from Washington.” 

West said the trouble had started sometime in the evening before the 


exam, when Ruby ran headfirst into his cell wall in an apparent suicide 
attempt. But Ruby’s jailer, Sheriff Bill Decker, shrugged it off as a cry for 
attention. “He rubbed his head on the wall enough that we had to put a little 
Merthiolate [antiseptic] on it,” Decker told a reporter. “That’s all.” 

From that day forward, every doctor who examined Ruby made similar 
diagnoses: he was delusional. West, however, was hardly the first to have 
evaluated him. By then nearly half a dozen psychiatrists, many equally 
renowned, had taken stock of Ruby’s condition, finding him essentially 
compos mentis. West had been briefed on these opinions, but in his hubris, he 
wrote that he’d hardly bothered with them, having been “unable to read them 
until earlier today on the airplane. Tonight, my own findings make it clear 
that there has been an acute change in the patient’s condition since these 
earlier studies were carried out.” 

The change was too “acute” for Judge Brown’s liking. In the preceding 
five months, he’d spent many hours in the courtroom with Ruby, and he’d 
never witnessed anything resembling the behavior West described. 
Presumably it wasn’t lost on him that this was the same doctor who’d 
clamored to see Ruby months earlier. After the judge heard West’s report, he 
ordered a second opinion, saying, “I would like some real disinterested 
doctors to examine Ruby for my own benefit. I want to get the truth out of 
it.” 

That opinion came from Dr. William Beavers, who examined Ruby two 
days after West. Beavers’s report to the judge, never before made public, 
confirmed West’s findings. Ruby “became agitated,” Beavers wrote, and 
“asked if I did not hear the sounds of torture that were going on.” Like Judge 
Brown, he was alarmed by the abruptness of Ruby’s disintegration. He 
considered the possibility that Ruby was malingering—but quickly ruled it 
out, explaining that it was “highly unlikely that this individual could have 
convincingly faked hallucinations.” Beavers wondered if Ruby had been 
tampered with or drugged by an outsider. “The possibility of a toxic 
psychosis could be entertained,” he wrote, “but is considered unlikely 
because of the protected situation.” 

The truth, by that point, was sealed up behind West. Beavers couldn’t 
have known that one of his fellow caregivers was capable of anything so 
diabolical as inducing mental illness in a patient. His report would have 
turned out differently, no doubt, if he’d been apprised of West’s unorthodox 


fortes, and his long relationship with the Central Intelligence Agency. 

Dozens of West’s colleagues offered me assessments of his character. 
There was praise, especially from those who’d worked with him at UCLA, 
but there was also condemnation, most of it from his former colleagues at 
Oklahoma, where he’d done the bulk of his MKULTRA research. He was a 
“devious man,” “egotistical,” an inveterate “narcissist” and “womanizer.” 
The few who hadn’t already suspected his involvement with the CIA 
accepted it readily. But the most relevant insight came from Dr. Jay Shurley, 
his good friend of forty-five years, who’d worked with West at Lackland Air 
Force Base and the University of Oklahoma. Shurley was one of the few 
colleagues who admitted that West was an employee of the CIA. I asked him 
if he thought West would’ve accepted an assignment from the CIA to 
scramble Jack Ruby’s mind. 

“T feel sort of disloyal to Jolly’s memory,” Shurley said, “but I have to be 
honest with you, my gut feeling would be yes. He would be capable of that.” 
Calling West “a very complex character,” he explained, “he had a little 
problem with grandiosity. He would not be averse at all to having influenced 
American history in some way or other, whether he got the credit for it or 
not... Jolly had a real streak of—I guess you’d call it patriotism. If the 
president asked him to do something, or somebody in a higher office... he 
would break his back to do that without asking too many questions.” 

“Even if it meant distorting American history?” 

“T suppose so,” Shurley said. “He was a pretty fearless kind of guy.” 


“A Deliberate Gangland Killing” 


West’s “fearless” intervention set the stage for decades of confusion and 
conspiracy in Washington. A week after Kennedy’s assassination, the newly 
installed president, Lyndon Johnson, hand-selected a group of thirteen men to 
investigate the crime. The President’s Commission on the Assassination of 
President Kennedy—better known as the Warren Commission, after its 
chairman, Chief Justice of the United States Earl Warren—had some dubious 
members in its ranks. One was Allen Dulles, the former CIA director. 
Kennedy had fired him two years earlier, after he’d bungled the Bay of Pigs 
invasion. Another was the official CIA liaison to the group, Richard Helms, 


soon to become the agency’s director. A protégé of Dulles, Helms was the 
longtime secret employer of Jolly West, and one of the few agency officials 
aware of MKULTRA. But no one else on the commission—except, 
presumably, Dulles, who started the program—was aware that a CIA “asset” 
trained in mind control had assumed responsibility for the psychiatric care of 
Jack Ruby, whom the commission regarded as their “most important 
witness.” 

In June 1964, Earl Warren and others from the group flew to Dallas to 
give Ruby a hearing in the interrogation room of the county jail. The bulk of 
his testimony was a morass of paranoid rambling. He begged Warren to get 
him out of Dallas. “The Jewish people are being exterminated at this 
moment,” he warned. “I know I won’t live to see you another time... Do I 
sound sort of screwy?” He demanded to speak with a Jew, whispering 
frantically, “You have to get me to Washington! They’re cutting off the arms 
and legs of Jewish children in Albuquerque and El Paso!” 

The commission, unable to extract a cogent account from their main 
witness, concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in assassinating 
Kennedy, and that Ruby did not act in a conspiracy to silence Oswald. 
Although they saw no evidence of a secret plot, they couldn’t definitively 
rule out such a thing. But their integrity was compromised the minute West 
set foot in Ruby’s jail cell. The group was required to investigate the CIA as 
a routine suspect in the assassination of a sitting president. Neither Dulles nor 
Helms ever reported their knowledge of West’s employment by the CIA. And 
soon Jack Ruby was no longer around to tell his own story. He died in 1967 
of complications from lung cancer. 

In the seventies, when Congress looked into abuses by intelligence 
agencies, it found evidence that the CIA and FBI had obstructed the Kennedy 
investigation. Dulles and Helms had deliberately concealed failed CIA plots 
to assassinate Cuba’s dictator, Fidel Castro. Allegedly, the CIA had aligned 
with organized crime figures, many sworn enemies of President Kennedy and 
his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy; they teamed up with anti- 
Castro Cubans in Miami and New Orleans to assassinate the dictator. Helms 
had personally overseen those schemes. 

The evidence, wrote House officials, “impeaches the process by which the 
intelligence agencies arrived at their own conclusions about the 
assassination.” Feeling it had no choice but to start over again, the House 


voted overwhelmingly to impanel the House Select Committee on 
Assassinations (HSCA) and reinvestigate. 

The HSCA openly aspired to make the Warren Report “persuasive.” Its 
final five-volume report—arriving in 1979, after two and a half years and 
$5.4 million in taxpayer money—did just the opposite. Based on new ballistic 
evidence of a second gunman in Dallas, the HSCA rejected the Warren 
Commission’s finding that Oswald had acted alone. There was a “probable 
conspiracy,” it announced, to assassinate the president. 

The committee had to be measured; it didn’t identify any potential 
coconspirators in the president’s murder. A few years later, freed of their 
congressional restraints, the committee’s G. Robert Blakey and Richard 
Billings published The Plot to Kill the President, an unmuzzled account of 
the investigation. “The murder of Oswald by Jack Ruby had all the earmarks 
of an organized crime hit, an action to silence the assassin, so he could never 
reveal the conspiracy,” they wrote. “Jack Ruby, working for the mob, after 
stalking Oswald for two days, silenced him forever. This was a deliberate 
gangland killing.” 

The coauthors saw no evidence implicating the CIA, but they remained 
suspicious. Their suspicions were borne out in the hulking twenty-seven- 
volume appendix of the HSCA witnesses’ published testimony, which 
described behind-the-scenes maneuvering by Dulles and Helms to obstruct 
the Warren Commission. Along with the FBI’s [[J Edgar Hoover]], Dulles and 
Helms were determined to present Oswald as a crazed lone assassin and 
Ruby as a distraught citizen. Hoover released the FBI’s initial findings just 
two weeks after the killing, concluding that Oswald acted alone. 

“Hoover lied his eyes out,” the Warren Commission’s Hale Boggs later 
testified in HSCA hearings, “on Oswald, on Ruby, on their friends, the 
bullets, the gun, you name it.” 

Dulles was no less complicit. He’d urged the Warren Commission to limit 
itself to reviewing the FBI’s investigation, rather than mounting its own. In 
secret, he met with Helms and other CIA officials to coach them on what 
questions the commission planned to ask. 

Faced with these revelations, the HSCA could only conclude that 
intelligence groups were hiding their links to Oswald and Ruby, if not a CIA 
effort to assassinate Castro. Some believed that the plot on Castro may have 
been turned on Kennedy, after his Bay of Pigs invasion failed and he 


embraced other policy changes that curtailed the agency’s influence, like 
reducing the U.S. presence in Vietnam, warming diplomatic relations with 
the Soviet Union, and decreasing military spending. Even President Johnson 
had his doubts. “The President felt that [the] CIA had had something to do 
with the plot,” said an Oval Office memo from ’67. 


If the CIA wanted to shut Ruby up, what was it that he had on it? Burt 
Griffin, an attorney for the Warren Commission, appeared before the HSCA 
to say that he and his partner had nearly confirmed Ruby’s ties to gunrunning 
schemes by anti-Castro Cubans, who were shipping arms from the United 
States to Cuba in hopes of deposing the dictator. 

At the time, Griffin had no idea that the CIA sponsored these gunrunning 
schemes. In March 1964—when Ruby was weeks away from his 
“examination” by Jolly West—Griffin and his partner approached Richard 
Helms, requesting all the information the CIA had on Ruby. They believed it 
was possible “that Ruby was involved in illegal dealings with Cuban 
elements who might have had contact with Oswald.” 

Helms offered only a curt reply: “The CIA would be very limited in its 
possibility of assisting.” Griffin was baffled—this was someone who was 
supposed to be helping him. He appealed again. By the time Helms mustered 
a response, months had passed, and West had long since paid his fateful visit 
to Ruby. “An examination of Agency files,” Helms wrote, “has produced no 
information on Jack Ruby or his activities.” 

As for Jolly West, he also did his part to keep Ruby untainted from any 
whiff of conspiracy. As the Warren Commission tried to divine Ruby’s 
motive, West sent a confidential letter to Earl Warren himself, a copy of 
which I discovered in the HSCA’s files. Dated June 23, 1964, and addressed 
to “My Dear Mr. Chief Justice,” Wests note contends that his 
“examinations” of Ruby gave him unique insight into the man’s “motivations 
for the murder.” (This despite the fact that West had said Ruby was 
“positively insane.”) He was confident that Ruby had acted in an “irrational 
and unpremeditated” manner when he shot Oswald, “wanting to prove that 
the Jews—through himself—loved their President and were not cowards.” 
Moreover, West asserted that Ruby “had never seen [Oswald] in his life” 
before his involvement in the Kennedy assassination broke. Without consent 


from his patient or his patient’s lawyers, West was offering confidential 
medical assessments tailored to political ends. “Please let me know if there is 
anything else that I can do to be of assistance,” he added. Warren didn’t. In 
an internal note, he dismissed the psychiatrist as an “interloper,” writing, “I 
see no need to do anything with this material.” Had he known of West’s CIA 
connections, he may have reacted differently. 

If West couldn’t foist his version of events onto the Warren Commission, 
he could at least make sure that no compromising information about Ruby 
emerged. At his urging, a psychiatrist named Dr. Werner Tuteur examined 
Ruby in July 1965 to prepare for an upcoming hearing on his sanity. Tuteur 
submitted a twelve-page report to West—it was there in his files, bundled 
with an edited version that West had submitted to the court. He struck just 
one passage, the most vital: “There is considerable guilt about the fact that he 
sent guns to Cuba,” Tuteur had written. “He feels he ‘helped the enemy’ and 
incriminated himself. ‘They got what they wanted on me.’” Erasing those 
lines, West expunged the very evidence Griffin had been looking for. 

West kept meticulous notes on the Ruby case, all dutifully filed. As 
investigators, scholars, and journalists struggled to piece together the puzzle, 
he watched from afar, compiling records for his own book about Ruby. He 
never ended up writing it, but he paid close attention to an exhaustive 1965 
volume, The Trial of Jack Ruby, by John Kaplan and Jon R. Waltz. They 
wrote, “The fact is that nobody knows why Jack Ruby shot Lee Harvey 
Oswald—and this includes Jack Ruby.” 

Jolly West had jotted down that line with a note to himself: “good quote.” 
It was, until now, the closest he ever came to receiving public credit for his 
work. 


Coda: “The Data-Spew” 


Libra, Don DeLillo’s 1988 novel about Lee Harvey Oswald, features a 
character named Nicholas Branch—a retired CIA analyst tasked with 
internally reviewing the agency’s conduct in the JFK assassination, once and 
for all. The assignment swallows him for fifteen years. The agency pays for 
the construction of a lavish, fireproof home office, which becomes, to 
Branch, “the book-filled room, the room of documents, the room of theories 


and dreams.” He reposes in “a glove-leather armchair,” surrounded by 
shelves and filing cabinets bursting with folders, cassettes, legal pads, and 
books. Branch “sits in the data-spew of hundreds of lives.” He comes to feel 
that “the past is changing as he writes.” And his ultimate subject, he knows, 
isn’t crime or politics. It’s “men in small rooms.” 

Although I had a sagging sofa instead of a glove-leather armchair, and 
while nothing in my apartment was fire-insured, let alone fireproof, I 
identified a lot with Nicholas Branch. I was immersed in records, voices from 
the past, competing narratives, complexity that sometimes seemed to multiply 
for its own sake. No matter which way I moved, the stories shifted beneath 
my feet. I was a man in a small room reading about men in small rooms. But 
where Nicholas Branch had the full backing of the CIA, I had only myself. 

As I worked to fill out my book proposal and, I hoped, draw my reporting 
to a close, I had dreams of sharing my findings with the members of the 
Warren Commission, brandishing evidence they’d never been able to prize 
out of the CIA. But most of the commission’s members were long dead. 
Gerald Ford wasn’t, but he wanted nothing to do with me. Burt Griffin, 
who’d been responsible for handling the Ruby aspect of the investigation, 
said in a phone interview that my findings were “very scary stuff,” and that 
West’s relationship with the CIA “should be investigated.” But he was long 
retired—if anyone was going to launch an investigation, it wouldn’t be him. 

I had better luck with Arlen Specter, then the senior senator from my 
home state of Pennsylvania. Late in 2002, visiting my parents in 
Philadelphia, I decided to see if he was interested in the papers I’d uncovered. 

Specter had joined the Warren Commission as a young investigative 
attorney. He’d participated in Ruby’s appearances before the commission. 
When Ruby dilated on his anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, he thought he 
had an ally in Specter, one of the commission’s only Jewish staff members. 
Specter was also responsible for the Warren Commission’s controversial 
“single bullet theory,” which argued that one bullet had taken a circuitous 
route through the bodies of John F. Kennedy and Governor John Connally, 
who had been sitting in front of Kennedy when he was shot. This theory ruled 
out the possibility of a second gunman, and Specter regarded it as gospel 
truth; he referred to it as the Single Bullet Conclusion. Since his role in the 
commission had launched his career, Specter had been unusually forthcoming 
about it over the years, eager to defend his position and to remind voters of 


his role in a seminal chapter of American history. 

Getting Specter’s attention took months. Through his aides, I wrangled 
what was supposed to be a two-minute phone interview. He called me from 
the Senate floor. I laid out my case as quickly as possible, with background 
on West, his involvement with the CIA’s MKULTRA experiments, and his 
examination of Ruby. 

Specter was intrigued. Our call ended up running to twenty minutes. 
Though he had no knowledge of the agency’s mind-control program or the 
congressional investigation into it, he seemed open to the possibility that 
West could have tampered with Ruby and, thus, with the Warren 
Commission’s findings. 

“Can you fax me these documents?” he asked, offering to approach the 
CIA about them. 

I wanted him to see them in person. Once they were out of my hands, 
there was no telling where they might end up, and alerting the CIA to them 
right away might not be in the best interest of my reporting. Specter sighed. 

Knowing that congressmen usually went home for weekends, I took a 
chance: “If you’re going to be in Philadelphia...” 

He had a squash match that Saturday at the Wyndham Plaza Hotel. He 
suggested I meet him there. His aide would call to set it up. 

I was thrilled—a sitting senator, a key investigator for the Warren 
Commission, was willing to hear me out in person. I followed up with a fax 
sharing some of the New York Times’s reporting on MKULTRA and more 
information on West. 

And then I got paranoid. 

I hadn’t gone through every box of West’s files yet. What if divulging my 
findings to Specter jeopardized my access to those? Someone could get there 
first and remove anything incriminating. 

But that was outlandish, I thought. I was flying back to L.A. at the end of 
the weekend. If I went to the UCLA files right away, I’d be fine—even the 
CIA couldn’t act so quickly. 

And yet the more I thought about it, the more distrustful I got. Why was 
Specter so eager to see the documents? He didn’t seem to care a whit about 
my credentials, or lack thereof. And could it really be true that a longtime 
senator had never heard of MKULTRA? Specter was the chairman of the 
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the same group that had 


investigated MKULTRA back in the day. He had the power to open doors for 
me, but if he was bent on upholding the Warren Commission’s findings, 
wouldn’t he just as soon close those doors? 

I was overthinking everything, and then overthinking my overthinking. At 
the end of the day, I decided to err on the side of caution and postpone our 
meeting. Maybe in the future I could have an attorney accompany me, or 
some impartial observer. 

The next morning, I left messages at Specter’s hotel and with his press 
office: I was profoundly sorry, but an emergency had come up, and I really 
had to leave for L.A. that afternoon. I went to run a few errands, trying to 
convince myself I hadn’t made a huge mistake. To this day, I wonder about 
that. 

While I was out, the phone rang and my mom picked up. It was Arlen 
Specter, sounding confused. Having been briefed on my plan, my mom told 
Specter I was on my way to the airport. (Her feelings were mixed, she told 
me later—her son was important enough to merit a call from a senator on a 
weekend, but her son had also made her lie to that senator.) 

Specter was gobsmacked. “So he’s not going to meet with me?” 

“Tm afraid not,” my mom said. 

I tried to reschedule our meeting for years. When I finally got him on the 
phone again, I was so shocked to have gotten through that I realized Pd long 
since stopped preparing for our talk. It had been months since I’d rehearsed 
the particulars of West and Ruby. I was much less convincing. He wasn’t 
interested in seeing any of my papers. 

“I just don’t see where this all leads,” Specter said. That was a phrase I’d 
be hearing a lot in the coming years.

Where Does It All Go? 


Writing the Music 


Jolly West’s MKULTRA letters were my biggest discovery, I thought. If 
there were an answer to that question of questions—how Manson got his 
followers to kill—TI felt it had to be there. I marshaled my energy in the hopes 
of discovering that they’d crossed paths, or that Manson’s enormous success 
in creating the Family had some debt to the CIA’s mind-control techniques. 
Even if I turned up nothing, I thought considering Manson and West in 
parallel was a worthy effort. Theirs was one of the great non sequiturs of the 
sixties. Manson, the ex-con, the Hollywood striver, the oversexed, unwashed 
guru who’d been discarded from society, had used LSD to collect and 
reprogram his followers. In the summer of love, he walked the same streets 
and frequented the same clinic as Jolly West, the upright air force officer, the 
world-renowned psychiatrist, the eloquent hypnotist who wrote to his CIA 
handler that there was “no more vital undertaking conceivable” than to dose 
unwitting research subjects with LSD and replace their memories. 

Both men were moralizers, hypocrites, and narcissists. And both were 
determined to make their presence felt in an America they felt had gone 
rotten. On the stand at his own trial, Manson said, “Is it a conspiracy that the 
music is telling the youth to rise up against the establishment?... It is not my 
conspiracy. It is not my music. I hear what it relates. It says rise, it says kill. 
Why blame it on me? I didn’t write the music.” On some level, he was right. 

I resumed work on my proposal feeling that I had enough to make even 
hardened skeptics doubt themselves a little bit. Though it took me years to 


get all my words in fighting condition, I finally finished in 2005. It came in at 
a whopping eighty thousand words, as long as many actual books. On the 
merits of the proposal, Penguin Press agreed to publish the book. I was 
elated, and more than a little relieved. I hadn’t known whether any 
respectable publisher would vouch for a project that mentioned Manson, Jack 
Ruby, and CIA mind control in the same breath. Penguin’s support was 
vindicating, and the advance payment it offered was more than enough to let 
me tie up my reporting. 

The complete manuscript was due in early 2008, a little less than three 
years away. Now all I had to do was finish my reporting and write the thing. 
The following year would be the thirtieth anniversary of the murders—I’d 
only missed my Premiere deadline by a decade. But that had been a 
magazine story. This would be a book. 


I had big plans for the money from my advance, which was more lucrative 
than Pd allowed myself to imagine it could be. I upgraded my computer, 
junked my old Acura, and bought... a used ’85 Volvo, for four hundred 
bucks. Everything else would go back into the book. Although my friends 
advised me to buy property and take an exotic vacation, I didn’t even 
consider it. I had at least three years of rigorous reporting and writing ahead 
of me. The money could help me accomplish what had been too costly or 
labor-intensive before. I hired two research assistants to help me get 
organized. They transcribed the endless hours of taped interviews I’d 
amassed—more than two hundred cassettes by then, most of their ninety 
minutes completely filled. They helped type out the handwritten notes on my 
sixty legal pads and thirty notebooks, and some of the passages Pd 
highlighted in some three hundred books. Most of my papers were in one of 
the 190 binders I had, and yet I’d allowed a half dozen stacks of unfiled 
documents to grow to about four feet high apiece. (At least they were 
separated by subject.) Reviewing the massive material record of my work 
was unsettling. I was rediscovering the fragments, micro-obsessions, and 
niggling questions that had tugged me onward when I began my reporting. 
Many I’d simply forgotten about; others were unresolved and probably 
always would be. But a few started to tempt me again. Now that I was 
finalizing everything, I had to be sure I hadn’t missed a lead. If a doubt sat in 


the back of my mind long enough, I added it to my to-do list. Soon it was 
dangerously long for someone with a book to write. 

One of the most basic problems I’d had over the years was tracking 
people down. Many former members of the Family had gone to great lengths 
to make themselves unreachable: they’d changed their names and severed ties 
with anyone who might’ve known about their pasts. At least the celebrities 
who’d said no to me once upon a time could be reached through publicists. 
Now I was looking for people who’d gone off the grid. I didn’t necessarily 
want to force anyone to speak to me. But what if someone in the Family 
remembered Jolly West, or Reeve Whitson, or any of the shadowy figures I’d 
investigated? What if, like the detective Charlie Guenther, they had 
something they’d wanted to get off their chest for thirty years? Some of my 
hostile interviewees had thawed when they saw that I didn’t have the 
sensational, tabloid-style agenda that fueled most reporting on Manson. 

So I also hired a private detective, a retired LASO deputy nicknamed 
Moon, who worked out of an office in Arizona. To this day, I’ve never met 
him, though we’ve shared thousands of emails and calls. Moon found people 
and police records I never could’ve turned up on my own. He’d participated 
in the LASO raid of the Spahn Ranch, and he reached out to other retired 
cops, urging them to speak to me. He also schooled me in skip tracing, the art 
of finding people who don’t want to be found. Before long I was paying to 
access digitized cross-directories and databases, including one called Merlin 
that required a PI license to use. (Moon took care of that for me.) Between 
the two of us, Moon and I located just about everyone who’d hung around 
with Manson, most of them scattered up and down the West Coast. I added 
them to my interview list, along with the usual mix of cops, lawyers, drug 
dealers, researchers, Hollywood has-beens, and congressmen. 

The extra help freed me up to do what I did best: dive into the archives. I 
had about a dozen places I needed to visit to fill in holes in my paper trail. 
There were old LAPD and LASO homicide detectives; district attorneys 
who’d offered to show me their stuff; files on the Family from courts, police 
departments, parks departments, and highway patrols that I’d persuaded the 
state of California to let me see for the first time; and personal files from 
reporters who’d long ago tried to investigate the same stuff I was after, most 
of them hitting the same dead ends. 

My to-do list was now as long as it’d been in the heaviest days of my 


reporting. And sometimes, behind my excitement and anxiety, I could feel a 
lower, deeper dread. Even if I could strengthen the bridge between Manson 
and West, I didn’t have a smoking gun—some fabled needle at the Spahn 
Ranch with Jolly West’s fingerprints on it, or a classified memo from the Los 
Angeles DA’s office to the FBI. I worried I never would. The evidence I’d 
amassed against the official version of the Manson murders was so 
voluminous, from so many angles, that it was overdetermined. I could poke a 
thousand holes in the story, but I couldn’t say what really happened. In fact, 
the major arms of my research were often in contradiction with one another. 
It couldn’t be the case that the truth involved a drug burn gone wrong, orgies 
with Hollywood elite, a counterinsurgency-trained CIA infiltrator in the 
Family, a series of unusually lax sheriff’s deputies and district attorneys and 
judges and parole officers, an FBI plot to smear leftists and Black Panthers, 
an effort to see if research on drugged mice applied to hippies, and LSD 
mind-control experiments tested in the field... could it? There was no way. 
To imagine state, local, and federal law enforcement cooperating in perfect 
harmony, with the courts backing them up—it made no sense. What I’d 
uncovered was something closer to an improvised, shambolic effort to 
contain the fallout from the murders. I couldn’t walk myself through the 
sequence of events without tripping on something. I was a lousy conspiracy 
theorist, at the end of the day, because I wanted nothing left to the realm of 
the theoretical. 

I was sure that at least one person had a better idea of the truth than I did. 
Before I went delving into any more archives or darting up the coast to 
confront former Family members, I had to return a phone call I’d been 
putting off for years. I had to talk to Bugliosi. 


My Adversary 


Back in 1999, Bugliosi had told me, “If there’s something about my handling 
of the case—anything at all—that you had a question about, I would 
appreciate if you would call me to get my view on it.” I’d promised to hear 
him out, imagining I’d circle back in another few months. Now seven years 
had passed, and I had so many questions that it took me weeks of preparation 
just to remember all of them. 


If I was reluctant to pick up the phone, it was because I was about to 
engage with a man who went to criminal lengths to protect his reputation. 
I’ve already mentioned Mary Neiswender, the reporter who told me that 
Bugliosi was “terribly dangerous”: he’d sent an emissary warning that he 
knew where her kids went to school and implied that “it would be very easy 
to plant narcotics in their lockers.” And I knew that Bugliosi had been 
indicted for perjury as a result of his prosecuting the murders—as mentioned 
earlier, he’d leaked information about Manson’s “hit list” to a reporter and 
had threatened professional consequences for his coprosecutors if they told 
anyone. 

Those turned out to be two of the milder incidents in his quest for self- 
preservation. In 1968, Bugliosi fell into a scandal kept under wraps by the 
DA’s office until ’72, when he was running for district attorney of Los 
Angeles. (He lost the election.) He’d stalked and terrorized someone he was 
convinced had carried on an affair with his wife and fathered his first-born 
child, Vincent Jr. As clichéd as it sounds, Bugliosi suspected his milkman, 
Herbert Weisel, who was married with two children. 

Weisel had left his job in 1965, eight months before Vincent Jr. was born. 
Bugliosi was sure that Weisel had quit because of his transgression—the 
evidence must’ve been in Weisel’s personnel file at the dairy. He made 
anonymous phone calls to Weisel’s wife and then to Weisel himself, 
demanding him to release his files. The couple began to notice “strange cars” 
circling their block after dark. They changed their phone number, which was 
already unlisted. Two days later, they got a typed letter postmarked from 
L.A. “You shouldn’t have changed your phone number,” it said. “That wasn’t 
nice.” 

Eventually, Bugliosi’s wife, Gail, approached the Weisels, revealing her 
identity in the hopes that she could arrange a détente. The Weisels told her 
that her husband should be getting psychiatric help. “She told us that she’d 
tried many times, but that he wouldn’t do it,” they later testified in a civil 
deposition. She’d taken paternity and lie-detector tests to prove the child was 
his, but he still harbored doubts. “I know he’s sick,” she said. “He’s got a 
mental problem.” 

The couple became so frightened that they stopped allowing their children 
to take the bus to school. They hired a lawyer and, after a mediation, Bugliosi 
agreed to stop harassing them and to pay them $100 for their silence. They 


refused the money. In ’72, with Bugliosi on the ballot, they decided it was 
their civic duty to go public—their tormentor aspired to the most powerful 
law enforcement job in the city. They told the papers of his yearlong 
harassment and intimidation campaign. 

Enlisting his well-documented talent for fabrication, Bugliosi retaliated, 
telling the press that Weisel had stolen money from his kitchen table seven 
years earlier. Weisel sued him for slander and defamation. It wasn’t a tough 
case to win. In depositions, Bugliosi and his wife swore they’d only been 
worried about the alleged robbery of their home. The Weisels proved 
otherwise, bringing in witnesses who exposed the Bugliosis as perjurers. 
Soon it came out that Bugliosi had twice used an investigator in the DA’s 
office—his office—to get confidential information about Weisel, claiming he 
was a material witness in a murder case. Fearing the disclosure would cost 
him his job, Bugliosi settled out of court, paying the Weisels $12,500. He 
paid in cash, on the condition that they sign a confidentiality agreement and 
turn over the deposition tapes. 

No sooner was the milkman imbroglio resolved than Bugliosi fell into 
another fiasco, again abusing his connection to the criminal justice system to 
straighten it out. His mistress, Virginia Cardwell, the single mother of a five- 
year-old, told him she was pregnant. It was his. With visions of public office 
still dancing in his mind, and Helter Skelter on the eve of publication, he 
ordered Cardwell, a Catholic, to get an abortion. She refused, but after 
Bugliosi threatened her and gave her money for the procedure, she lied and 
said she’d done it. He wasn’t about to take her word for it. He got her 
doctor’s name, called him, and learned that she’d never been to see him, after 
which he headed to her apartment and beat her so savagely that she suffered a 
miscarriage. He choked her, struck her in the face several times with his fists, 
threw her onto the floor, pulled her up by her hair, and threatened to kill her 
if she had the baby, saying she wouldn’t leave the apartment alive if she lied 
to him: “I will break every bone in your body—this will ruin my career.” 
Bruised and battered, Cardwell gathered herself and went to the Santa 
Monica Police Department, where she filed a criminal complaint. The cops 
photographed her bruises and then, evidently, did nothing. 

That evening, an eagle-eyed reporter spotted the incident on the police 
blotter and wrote about it in the next day’s paper. Bugliosi returned to 
Cardwell’s apartment that morning, this time with his secretary. The pair held 


her hostage for four hours until she agreed to tell the police she’d filed a false 
complaint the previous day. Bugliosi assured her he’d use his contacts in the 
DA’s office to make sure she was never brought to trial for the false report. 
He and his secretary used Cardwell’s typewriter to forge a backdated bill for 
legal services, telling her to show it to the police. He listened in on an 
extension as she called to turn herself in. The dispatcher said they’d send a 
patrol car to get her. He vigorously shook his head, and Cardwell told the 
dispatcher she’d be fine getting in on her own. 

The dispatcher sent a car anyway. One of the detectives who’d seen 
Cardwell that day, Michael Landis, told me Bugliosi and “a couple of his 
associates” answered the door “and tried to discourage us from talking to her. 
We were persistent and we did see her—and she was pretty well banged up.” 
Cardwell claimed that the bruises were from an accident: her son had hit her 
in the face with a baseball bat. She’d only blamed Bugliosi because she was 
angry that he’d overcharged her for legal advice concerning her divorce. 
“This outrageous charge, even though false, can be extremely harmful,” 
Bugliosi told police. 

Cardwell’s brother persuaded her to file a lawsuit against Bugliosi. 
Bugliosi’s story fell apart before the suit was even filed, and he settled with 
Cardwell in exchange for her confidentiality—ensuring, he hoped, that his 
lies to the police, fabrication of evidence, and obstruction of justice would 
never see the light of day. He was wrong. The Virginia Cardwell story hit the 
papers in 1974, when his opponent in the California state attorney general’s 
race, Joseph Busch, caught wind of it. (Bugliosi lost that election, too.) 
Because of his clout in the DA’s office, he was never prosecuted for 
assaulting Cardwell. Landis, the detective, called him “a whiney, sniveley 
little bastard,” saying, “I wanted to prosecute the son of a bitch.” 

All of which is to say that I approached Bugliosi with extreme caution. 

And at first, he refused to grant me another interview. In the intervening 
years, he explained, he’d heard from two unnamed “sources” that I’d done 
“terrible things” in my “private life.” He refused to say what these things 
were. I knew Pld done nothing wrong. I told him to go ahead and expose 
whatever it was he had on me—it would never hold up to scrutiny. I added 
that I’d amassed a lot of documents, including some in his own hand, that 
raised questions about the integrity of the prosecution. But he was adamant: 
no interview. Furthermore, if my book defamed or libeled him, he would hold 


me liable to the greatest degree of the law. “You don’t want to be working for 
me the rest of your life,” he said. “I think you know what I mean.” He hung 
up. 

And then, ten minutes later, he called back. He wanted to repeat the same 
conversation we’d just had, to pretend like we were having it for the first 
time. His wife, Gail, would be listening in on another extension as a 
“witness,” so I wouldn’t misrepresent what he’d said. 

“You want us to repeat the conversation word for word, like it hadn’t 
already happened?” I asked. 

“Yes,” he said. “Or, you know, the essence of the conversation.” 

It was a ridiculous exercise. I agreed anyway; I wanted to keep our lines 
of communication open, and I had a morbid desire to see how it played out. I 
told him I’d only do it if I could tape the call, so I’d have a “witness,” too. He 
agreed. 

Listening back to it now, I’m amazed: we really did it. We had the same 
talk again, with occasional corrections. (“No, Vince, you said you’d sue me 
for 100 million dollars, not millions of dollars.”) Every few minutes, Bugliosi 
would make sure that Gail was still listening. “Yes,” she’d sigh. “I’m here.” 
As for the papers I had, he told me, “Documents may be accurate... but it 
doesn’t make the document itself truthful.” And even if he wanted to sit 
down with me—which he didn’t, because of the “terrible things” I’d done— 
he couldn’t, because he was “absolutely swamped.” He didn’t even have time 
to go to a Super Bowl party that “some prominent people” had invited him to. 

“I kind of doubt that under any circumstances I’d be willing to give you 
an interview,” he said. “But if you send me a letter specifying everything you 
want to talk about, or the essence of what you want to talk about, there’s an 
outside possibility that I may find the time, or make the time.” 

I never sent that letter. Experience had taught me that the longer I stayed 
silent, the more agitated Bugliosi would become. Despite his protestations, he 
really wanted to know what I’d write about him. A week later, he called and 
said that his wife had persuaded him to sit down with me. The interview was 
on. 


Bugliosi Redux 


And so we return to that sunny day in February 2006, when Bugliosi gave me 
a stern dressing-down at his home in Pasadena, his wife looking on 
phlegmatically. That was the day he announced himself as my “adversary” 
and issued a forty-five-minute “opening statement,” his kitchen now his 
courtroom as he mounted the case that he was a “decent guy” who’d “never 
hurt anyone in the first instance.” He would retaliate “in the second instance,” 
in self-defense or “to get even, or to get justice.” 

As if to prove that point, he kept threatening to sue me, making it clear 
that he wouldn’t tolerate any allegation of misconduct. He spoke so quickly, 
and with such a flurry of hyperbole and legalism, that I could hardly rebut 
one of his points without three more rising up to take its place. Just as my 
encounter with Roger Smith had, my interview with Bugliosi lasted for some 
six hours, and I came out of it with little more than a list of denials and 
evasions. But at least Smith had given me wine and pizza. Bugliosi gave me 
only vitriol. 

Before we met, I rehearsed my questions with an actor friend who stepped 
into Bugliosi’s shoes. We developed a plan on how best to deploy my 
findings and parry his denials. I brought binders full of documents and 
carefully highlighted passages from Helter Skelter so that I could refresh his 
memory if he claimed not to recall certain particulars from the case. 

But right away, Bugliosi threw me off. “Ask me your hardest question,” 
he said at the outset. And so I started with everything I had on Terry Melcher, 
suggesting that Bugliosi had covered up for him and that he’d been much 
friendlier with Manson than had been revealed. It was the wrong move—I’d 
intended to build to this moment, and now I was leading with it, giving him 
every reason to take a contentious tone. Pulling out a passage from Helter 
Skelter, I showed Bugliosi what he’d written about Dean Moorehouse, the 
member of the Family who, according to the prosecutor, stayed at the house 
on Cielo Drive “for a brief period” after Melcher moved out. 

“That’s not true,” I said. “He never lived there after Melcher moved out. 
He lived there the summer before, off and on with Melcher.” I showed him 
that Dean Moorehouse was actually in prison when Bugliosi had said he lived 
at the Cielo house. 

“T forget what you’re telling me,” Bugliosi said. “The matter of where and 
how, I forget that kind of stuff. Thirty-five years ago, I’ve gone after a 
million things since then... There’s a lot of errors in the book.” He’d 


authored it with a cowriter, and he’d been too busy running for district 
attorney to fact-check every last word. 

“This may have gotten past me,” he said. “I’m [more] interested in 
anything you would have that would indicate that I may have misled the jury, 
because I don’t believe that happened intentionally.” 

I took out the pages in Bugliosi’s own handwriting: notes from his 
interview with Danny DeCarlo, one of his main witnesses, who’d said that 
Terry Melcher had visited Manson three times after the murders, 
contravening what Melcher had said on the stand. 

“This was after the murders?” Bugliosi clarified, reading through his own 
notes. “Are you sure about that?” 

“You wrote it,” I said. He confirmed they were his notes and read them 
again. 

“You have to know, Tom, that when people are talking to you they garble 
things up... My god. They tell a story—” 

“But this is not ambiguous. You write, ‘Definitely saw Melcher out at 
Spahn Ranch. Heard girls say, Terry’s coming! Terry’s coming!’ And you 
make a point of writing down that it was after the August 16th bust. There’s 
nothing ambiguous about when it was.” 

“Pm being a hundred percent candid with you,” Bugliosi said, “this is 
new to me. I’m not saying I didn’t know it at the time, don’t get me wrong, 
but I absolutely have no impression, no recollection of this at all.” He sighed. 
“What’s the point?... How does it help me with the jury?” 

I thought it impeached Melcher’s testimony, which had been essential to 
the case. It made him a dirtier witness, I said, because he had a relationship 
with the murderers after the murders. I showed him the sheriff’s interview 
with the Family’s Paul Watkins, who remembered seeing Melcher on his 
knees, on acid, begging for Manson’s forgiveness at the Spahn Ranch— 
again, after the murders. Didn’t it suggest some kind of complicity? 

Bugliosi leveled an intense stare at me. “I was not trying to protect Terry 
Melcher,” he said. “Why would I try to deceive the jury on something that 
the opposition had? I turned over everything to them.” 

But Paul Fitzgerald, the defense attorney, “said he never saw any of that. 
He said he was shocked,” I explained. 

“He may have forgotten about them himself!” Bugliosi shouted. “Look, if 
I’m going to try to hide them, I throw them away! Why wouldn’t I throw 


them away? Everything that I had was turned over to the defense. 
Everything.” 

“He didn’t say he didn’t remember, he said he never saw it.” 

Bugliosi scoffed. “Terry would never have associated with these people if 
he thought they committed these murders,” he said. “If he did go out there 
afterward, it wasn’t because he was complicit... Pm investigating this case, 
I’m handling all the witnesses, things could have gotten past me. But you’ve 
got to ask yourself this question, what could I possibly gain?” 

I told him how Stephen Kay, his own coprosecutor, had reacted to these 
documents: “If Vince was covering this stuff up... what else did he change?” 

Bugliosi gave a brittle laugh. “Oh, Jesus, that is so laughable it’s just 
unbelievable. Just absolutely unbelievable. That Pd cover up that Terry 
Melcher had gone out to Spahn Ranch after the murders. It’s just so 
extremely insignificant, it wouldn’t help me at all.” But it wasn’t 
insignificant, and from his reaction I could tell he knew it. These pages 
rewrote the narrative of the case. That’s why Melcher had threatened to throw 
them from his rooftop; that’s why Bugliosi would sue me if I printed them. 

Around and around we went. Bugliosi said, “When Terry was on the 
witness stand, did he testify that he never saw Manson after May?” 

“Yeah,” I said. “So, that’s perjury.” 

“So you’re saying that Terry lied on the witness stand.” Still, he didn’t see 
the point, or pretended not to. Until I read him his own closing argument, he 
refused to recognize that he’d even used Melcher as part of the motive for the 
murders. He’d said in his summation, “indirectly [Manson] was striking back 
at Terry Melcher personally. By ordering a mass murder at Melcher’s former 
residence, Manson obviously knew that Melcher’s realization that these 
murders took place at a residence in which he lived just a couple of months 
earlier would literally paralyze Melcher with fear.” If that were so, why did 
Melcher go out to visit Manson at least three times afterward? All Bugliosi 
could say about the matter was that it “must have slipped past me.” To accuse 
him of conspiring with Melcher was “mind-boggling craziness.” 

What about Reeve Whitson, the mysterious figure who’d helped gain the 
testimony of Sharon Tate’s photographer friend, Shahrokh Hatami? Did 
Bugliosi remember Whitson? 

“Oh, possibly,” he said. 

The hours ticked by, and whatever I threw at him, he deflected. The 


replacement of Susan Atkins’s attorney? I showed him the memos. “I don’t 
remember any of this stuff.” 

Manson’s mysterious move to San Francisco, which violated his parole 
even though Bugliosi had wrongly written that he “requested and received 
permission” for it? “I can’t even remember that.” 

How about the warrant for the massive August 16 raid at the Spahn 
Ranch? Bugliosi had asserted, incorrectly, that it was “misdated.” “I don’t 
know where I got that,” he said. 

“I wanted to ask you about Roger and David Smith,” I said. (I wasn’t 
about to get into the matter of Jolly West; I knew it’d be met with a blank 
stare.) 

“Who are they?” I gave him my spiel on the paramount significance of 
Manson’s year in San Francisco. “That’s good stuff that you’ve come up 
with,” he said. “Are they mentioned in my book?” Barely, I said. He was 
unfazed. “Must’ve gotten past me.” 

To present our back-and-forth in granular detail would be excruciating— 
reading through the transcript never fails to give me a headache. Suffice it to 
say that the subject of Terry Melcher always riled him up. Anything and 
everything else, he hardly cared about; if it didn’t involve him directly, he 
had no use for it. He reiterated that he was “the fairest prosecutor in the 
land,” and that a hefty hundred-million-dollar lawsuit awaited me if I 
suggested otherwise. This is when he fell into his refrain about “the Man in 
the Mirror.” Because he was ethical “to an unprecedented degree,” he could 
live with the sight of his own reflection. He didn’t understand how I could 
live with mine. Manson himself had a fondness for the same phrase: “I am 
the man in the mirror,” he said. “Anything you see in me is in you, I am you, 
and when you can admit that you will be free.” 

When Bugliosi and I finished, at last, he confessed that he was sometimes 
obsessive and overreactive—Gail had told him he might have a psychiatric 
disorder. But he’d done nothing wrong, and he didn’t want his admittedly 
frenetic behavior to color my impressions of his conduct as a prosecutor. 

It was a rare moment of self-awareness, probably the last I ever saw in 
him. The aftermath of our meeting was a series of alternately coaxing and 
acrimonious phone calls at all hours of the day and night, conveying a thinly 
veiled ultimatum: I could drop anything negative about him from my book or 
fear his wrath. If I published such “outrageous,” “preposterous,” and 


“unbelievable” lies, the lawsuit was a foregone conclusion. 

Before the litigation, though, would come the letter: a cri de coeur to my 
editor at Penguin, with the publisher and president of the company in cc. It 
would be “very, very, very long,” Bugliosi warned. He’d take “six, seven, 
eight hours” to write the first of “many drafts.” He didn’t want to do it—he’d 
gladly tear it up if I called to apologize. 

“There is nothing to decide, here, Tom,” he continued, sounding like a 
used-car salesman. “It’s so damn easy.” 

When I declined for the last time, he said, “We should view ourselves as 
adversaries,” and told me to expect the letter. 


Now that Bugliosi was my sworn adversary, his next move hardly came as a 
Surprise: the smear campaign. First thing next morning, I got a panicked 
message from Rudi Altobelli, the flamboyant talent manager who’d owned 
the house on Cielo Drive. We hadn’t spoken in four years. 

“Please give me a call so I can understand what I’m talking about,” the 
elderly Altobelli said. “I still love you.” 

Altobelli had gotten a disturbing call from Bugliosi. “The first thing he 
wanted to know about was your relationships with young boys,” he told me 
when I called back. As Bugliosi remembered it, Altobelli had told him years 
ago that I “dated ten, twelve, and fourteen-year-olds,” Altobelli said, adding 
that he knew it was a lie. I’m gay, and when Altobelli and I became friends, I 
was dating someone younger—but he was twenty-nine, not twelve. At that 
time, Bugliosi was in regular communication with Altobelli, who felt he 
must’ve told him I was dating a younger guy. But then and now, Bugliosi 
knew he meant a young man, not a kid. “You’re creating something that isn’t 
so,” Altobelli told him. 

“Pm not going to talk to him anymore,” Altobelli said. “Ever.” Bugliosi 
kept calling for weeks; in just one morning, he left seven messages on 
Altobelli’s machine. He wanted Altobelli to sign a letter saying I’d lied about 
Melcher. Altobelli refused. 

At least now I knew the “terrible things” about me that Bugliosi had 
referred to; they were as transparently false as I’d suspected. I could see why 
he’d twice been sued for defamation. In his long career, Bugliosi had lied 
under oath; he’d lied to newspapers; he’d lied to police and investigators 


from his own office. Now that I’d called him a liar, he was plenty willing to 
lie about me, too. 

His letter arrived at Penguin on July 3, 2006. It had taken five months to 
write. It was thirty-four pages, single-spaced. And, as it turned out, it was the 
first of many such letters. As Bugliosi had promised, copies were delivered to 
my editor and my publisher, so we could take in its distortions, ad hominem 
attacks, and vigorous self-aggrandizement as a team. Often referring to me as 
“super-sleuth O’ Neal”—the misspelling was intentional, I believe; he’d done 
the same to his nemesis Stephen Kay in Helter Skelter—Bugliosi claimed 
that I’d first approached him for the sole purpose of discovering titillating 
factoids about Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski’s “private sex and drug 
lives.” (Easy to disprove—I’d taped the whole interview.) He hinted at his 
allegations of pedophilia and claimed that Pd accused him of framing 
Manson. Most of all, he attacked the significance—or lack thereof—of my 
findings on Terry Melcher. 

“Can you see why there is a part of me that actually wants O’Neal’s 
dream to come true,” he wrote, “so that I can have the opportunity to get even 
with him and destroy his life more than he’s trying to destroy mine?” If 
Penguin moved forward with my book, the publisher “would almost 
assuredly be perceived by the national media as taking a position in defense 
of Charles Manson, one of history’s most notorious murderers.” He followed 
up with letters to all of the Family’s imprisoned murderers except Manson 
himself, asking if they’d refute my claims about Melcher’s involvement with 
the group. No one replied. 

When it became clear that Penguin would stand behind me, Bugliosi sent 
another letter in 2007. And another in 2008, inveighing against my project 
and the irreparable harm it would do to his children, especially if, as I’d told 
him I would, I detailed the lawsuits he’d faced over the years. 

Pd promised my editor that I’d finish my reporting by August 1, 2006. 
Though I may never have hit that deadline anyway, Bugliosi’s letter derailed 
me. Everyone I knew urged me not to respond on a point-by-point basis. But 
how could I not? I had no intention of replying to him directly, but he’d 
gotten the best of my inner obsessive, and I spent a while collating all the 
evidence that refuted his claims. If he did plan on suing me, I’d be ready. In 
light of his threats, I told him I was now treating everything he’d said to me 
as on the record. Back in 1999, he’d given me my first shred of new 


information on the case, telling me off the record that Roman Polanski had 
forced Sharon Tate to have sex with two other men on tape. Since Bugliosi 
had detailed this allegation in one of his letters to Penguin, I saw no need to 
keep it off the record. 

My fastidiousness distracted me from that looming dread, perhaps best 
articulated by Bugliosi himself: “Where does it all go, Tom? Where does it 
all go?” I thought his apoplexy confirmed that I was on the right track, but 
Pd have to find the answers without any help from him. And now there was 
another unanswerable question: Was it all worth it? All the lonely hours in 
my car, the endless days poring over transcripts at archives from the edge of 
Death Valley to small towns in Washington and Nevada; begging and 
battling for police records; studying obscure medical journals and academic 
papers; filing hundreds of FOIA requests; fielding death threats and promises 
of litigation... could I really say it was worth it? Honestly, I didn’t know 
anymore. And this was before I fell into a debt of more than half a million 
dollars. 


Digging for Bodies in the Desert 


Bugliosi had rattled me, but I tried to shake him off. I had a book to finish— 
or, more realistically, a book to start. Whenever I sat down, opened up 
Microsoft Word, and confronted a blinking cursor over a snowy expanse of 
white, I found it easy to make other plans. Sometimes I’d eke out ten or 
fifteen pages only to recoil at the holes in my story. My theory that Manson 
and West were linked was tenuous, circumstantial, lying solely in the fact 
that they’d walked the corridors of the same clinic. Wouldn’t it be more 
effective to argue that the entire prosecution of Manson was a sham, with 
Helter Skelter as a cover-up? Bugliosi had said he “must have missed” 
Manson’s San Francisco chapter—but everyone who knew him said he’d 
never miss it. I had to show that he concealed more, that witnesses besides 
Melcher lied, that there was an elaborate scheme to misrepresent the facts. 
Sure, I told myself: that would be better. I’d go back to the trial transcripts— 
maybe a few weeks here, a spare weekend there, while I wrote. Maybe Jolly 
West didn’t even belong in the book. Maybe Reeve Whitson was just 
padding. Maybe, maybe... 


I put more effort into begging for deadline extensions than I did into 
writing the book. And the world kept concocting reasons for me to keep 
reporting. Toward the end of 2007, a homicide cop named Paul Dostie 
claimed to have found forensic evidence of at least five bodies buried at the 
Barker Ranch in Death Valley, where Manson was captured in 1969. Dostie’s 
trained cadaver dog had sniffed out unidentified remains in the area. As part 
of a big PR push, Dostie asked me for information supporting the possibility 
that these could be Manson’s long rumored additional victims. His comrade- 
in-arms was Debra Tate, Sharon’s sister, who had become a good friend of 
mine. Their effort garnered national media coverage. Soon the Inyo County 
Sheriff’s Office authorized a dig in the desert. 

Skeptics liked to ask: What did it matter if the police had taken so many 
months to bring the Family to justice after the murders? Even if they fudged 
the investigation, they still found him eventually. My answer was always that 
the Family may have used those extra months to continue their murder spree. 
At the trial, a ranch hand told police that Manson had bragged about killing 
thirty-five people; Bugliosi thought the number “may even exceed Manson’s 
estimate.” The bodies had been buried or staged to look like suicides. Just 
because the Family had never been prosecuted for these killings didn’t mean 
they hadn’t happened. If I could put a human face on the death toll, I could 
say with certainty that we were right to question the official narrative—that 
the failures of the police, deliberate or not, had a steep cost. 

Dostie’s dig could help me with that, but I already had a lead on a 
promising unsolved murder from the Family’s time in Death Valley. In 
January 2008—motivated by the surge of support for Dostie’s work, petitions 
from Debra Tate, and my own preliminary reporting—police announced that 
they were reopening an investigation into this death. This was great news, 
except when it came to my book. I worried that the renewed attention would 
compromise my final reporting. Former Family members might go back 
underground after I’d taken months to find out where they lived. The police 
might flush out information about the unsolved murder that I’d been on the 
brink of finding myself. I had to hit the road right away. The writing was on 
hold yet again. 

A good part of my trip was a bust. I spent six months living out of cheap 
motels and crashing on friends’ couches, racing across the Pacific Northwest 
to confront Family members at their doorsteps, along with a slew of other 


boldfaced names from Helter Skelter, most of whom had never been found. 
They were not happy to see me. Very few of them agreed to speak to me at 
all. Several chased me off their property—two with gardening shears. 

Just when I was starting to think that the trip was a total wash, I made my 
last big break. I had proof—beyond a reasonable doubt, I thought—that the 
Manson Family had killed a young man in the desert, and that investigators 
had covered it up. 


What Happened to Filippo Tenerelli? 


On September 29, 1969, a twenty-three-year-old named Filippo Tenerelli left 
his parents’ home in a brand-new Volkswagen Beetle. Tenerelli, a native 
Italian, had immigrated to Los Angeles with his family in 1959. He had no 
history of mental illness and no arrests. 

Tenerelli made the long drive from Culver City to Father Crowley Point, 
an overlook at Death Valley National Park offering majestic desert vistas. He 
was there to drive his car over the cliff. 

But at the precipice, the Beetle got caught on boulders, thwarting his 
suicide. Frustrated, Tenerelli took a pickax and a shovel from his trunk and 
dislodged the car. Then, his fury overpowering his suicidal impulses, he 
pushed it over the edge. The car fell some four hundred feet, coming to rest 
wheels up at the bottom of the canyon. He clambered down the steep, rocky 
terrain, reached into the car to retrieve his belongings, and cut his hands on 
something inside, leaving blood splatters on the ceiling. 

No one knew how Tenerelli spent the rest of the day, or the day following. 
On the evening of the thirtieth, he wound up in Bishop, California, one 
hundred miles away. He checked into unit 3 of the Sportsman’s Lodge motel, 
where he again tried and failed to kill himself, slashing his right wrist. The 
cut was superficial, and he covered it with a bandage. 

The next day, October 1, Tenerelli went to the town’s sporting-goods 
store and bought a twenty-gauge shotgun, some ammo, a case, and a cleaning 
kit. Elsewhere, he picked up two fifths of whiskey, two pairs of underwear, a 
safety razor, and an issue of Playboy. 

That night Tenerelli emerged from his motel room when he heard fire 
engines. The fire department was doing a controlled demolition of a building 


across the street. The motel owner, Bee Greer, was watching, and she told 
Tenerelli what was going on. He observed the fire for a while and returned to 
his room. No one saw him alive again. 

A maid tried to get into Tenerelli’s room the next morning. The door was 
barricaded from the inside. Around noon, Greer’s husband and son pushed it 
in. There was Tenerelli, dead of a gunshot to the face. 

Police reports concluded that Tenerelli had blocked the door with a chair, 
put the loaded shotgun into his mouth, and pulled the trigger with his toe. He 
was lying on his back on the floor, dressed only in jeans, with “two Turkish 
bath towels under his head, possibly to soak up blood,” and “a bed pillow 
over his head, apparently to muffle the sound.” He’d shaved all of his pubic 
hair—some of it was between the pages of the Playboy he’d bought. But 
when he’d checked in to the motel, he’d given someone else’s name. With no 
ID to be found, he was listed as a John Doe. 


Tenerelli’s family filed a missing persons report on October 3. The next day, 
two hunters spotted his overturned Beetle at the bottom of Father Crowley 
Point and notified the California Highway Patrol. An officer went to look 
and, noticing the blood on the ceiling, suspected foul play. The Tenerelli 
family learned that their son’s abandoned car had been discovered in Death 
Valley. 

For three weeks, the Bishop Police Department tried to ID their John Doe 
while the county sheriff’s office looked for the missing Tenerelli. They never 
connected their parallel investigations, though they had stations next door to 
each other in Bishop, and the same coroner’s office served them both. 

On October 30, the Inyo Register reported that the “suicide victim” had 
been positively identified as Filippo Tenerelli of Culver City. Tenerelli had 
been [Ded by X-rays that matched his patient records at an L.A. hospital. But 
the case was soon pushed from the local papers by an even wilder story: in a 
remote area of Death Valley, a band of nomadic hippies had been arrested for 
destroying government property and operating an auto-theft ring. In the 
coming weeks, they’d be charged with the grisly murders of Sharon Tate and 
seven others in Los Angeles. 

Although it wasn’t reported at the time, the Inyo County Sheriff’s Office 
and the California Highway Patrol did briefly consider the possibility that the 


Family was responsible for Tenerelli’s death. According to documents I 
found, investigators doubted that Tenerelli had died by his own hand; they 
had evidence linking Family members to his death. Their suspicions were 
obliquely referenced in a Los Angeles Times story two weeks after the Family 
was charged in the Tate-—LaBianca murders. The paper reported that law 
enforcement was looking into other potential Family murders, including a 
“motorcyclist killed in Bishop.” Six months later, a Rolling Stone story 
quoted an “insider” in the Los Angeles DA’s office—later identified as 
Aaron Stovitz—who suggested that the death of “a Philip Tenerelli” might’ve 
been the Family’s doing. But no one had reported what, if anything, led 
investigators to their suspicions. In 2007, when I began looking into 
Tenerelli’s death, no one outside of law enforcement had seen documents 
linking Tenerelli to the Family. 

I started with three people: the mayor of Bishop, Frank Crom, who’d been 
on the police force in 1969; Lieutenant Chris Carter, currently of the Bishop 
Police Department; and Leon Brune, the chief deputy coroner in ’69, and still 
coroner of Inyo County. 

Carter said the records of Tenerelli’s suicide had been “purged.” Only 
unsolved homicide records were kept indefinitely. (Another cop who’d 
worked the case said he’d seen the records as recently as 1993.) Brune, 
meanwhile, faxed me the autopsy report and his investigation of the death. 
His record gave me a much clearer picture of Tenerelli’s death, but I found 
some glaring inconsistencies. The story got even murkier when I tracked 
down the original Bishop Police Department investigative report, which 
suggested a far more sinister ending to Tenerelli’s life—and, perhaps more 
disturbing, a cover-up of that ending by investigators that continued into the 
present. Something was wrong. 

I met Brune at his mortuary in Bishop, where I was ushered into a somber 
reception area and asked to wait: he was with someone at the moment. That 
someone turned out to be Mayor Frank Crom, who didn’t offer me his hand 
when he emerged from Brune’s office. Instead, he followed me back into the 
room—he intended to sit in on our interview, whether I minded or not. As we 
took our seats, I got out my tape recorder. Crom said he wouldn’t allow our 
conversation to be recorded. Things didn’t get much better from there. Crom 
answered or amended my questions to Brune, constantly interrupting us. 

I tried to ask Brune about the sketch of the murder scene I’d found among 


the pages he’d faxed. Why weren’t the motel room windows included in the 
sketch? No mention was made of them in the report. How big were they? 
When the body was discovered, were they open or closed, locked or 
unlocked? 

Crom answered for him: “No one could’ve gotten in or out of those 
windows. They were too small.” 

Barely ten minutes after we started, Brune shot a nervous glance at Crom 
and ended the meeting. He had business to attend to. I’d asked him only half 
of my questions. Crom got me out of the building and followed me to my car, 
repeating that there was no way the death was anything but a suicide. He 
suggested I was wasting my time. Everything in his behavior said the 
opposite. 

The Sportsman’s Lodge, where Tenerelli died, was long gone. But Bee 
Greer, the owner, wasn’t. A spry eighty-one-year-old widow with a razor- 
sharp memory, she flatly contradicted the mayor’s statement that her motel 
windows were too small to climb in or out of. Maybe even two people at a 
time could fit through them, she said. Her son, Kermit, who’d helped push in 
the barricaded door of Tenerelli’s room, was with us that day. He added that 
his parents had often punished him by locking him in the same unit. He’d 
always climb out the windows, he said, and he wasn’t much smaller then than 
he was now. (And he was a big guy.) 

If I didn’t believe him, why not go see for myself? The motel hadn’t been 
demolished, he reported. It’d been sold to an alfalfa ranch just outside of 
town: they picked up the whole structure and moved it out there a few years 
before. 

I drove out to Zack’s Ranch to have a look. Just as the Greers had said, 
the windows were big enough for two people to climb through at the same 
time. Andi Zack, whose late father had bought the motel units, told me that 
all the windows were original. She showed me unit 3 and let me photograph 
it. 

Bee Greer remembered when Tenerelli showed up to the motel. He 
arrived without a car, she said, which was why he had to show her a driver’s 
license—something the police and the newspapers had explicitly said he 
didn’t do. 

“I never would’ve checked anyone in who came without a car and a 
license,” she said—without those, she’d have no collateral if there were 


damages to the property or the customer tried to bolt without paying. She 
copied the license information into her register, which she later gave to the 
police. But the cops, Crom among them, refused to believe that the victim 
had showed her ID, or even that he had a wallet. “They kept coming back and 
trying to talk me out of it,” she said, still angry all these years later. “It was a 
wallet with a driver’s license—but they didn’t want me to say that.” 

Later, I found a registration form from the Sportsman’s Lodge. It had 
Tenerelli’s name on it—misspelled—and it showed that he paid for a thirty- 
three-day stay beginning on October 1, 1969. The total was $156, paid in full. 
Bee Greer told me it was “exactly” the same registration form she would’ve 
used in 1969, but a couple of things didn’t seem right. The customer always 
filled out the form. Why would Tenerelli have spelled his own name wrong? 
There should’ve been a home address and a driver’s license number, but 
neither was there. Tenerelli’s sister later confirmed that this wasn’t his 
handwriting. Plus, Tenerelli had a noticeable Italian accent. The man Greer 
spoke with had no accent at all. Maybe someone had checked in under 
Tenerelli’s name, paying for a month in advance to ensure that the body 
wouldn’t be discovered right away. 

The police reports contained no photographs of the crime scene. They 
made no mention of any forensics tests—no ballistics, blood splatters, 
fingerprints, rigor mortis. Officials I spoke to said these would have been 
routine in an unattended shooting death, even in 1969. There was a lab report 
showing that Tenerelli’s blood-alcohol level at the time of his death was 
03%, which doesn’t even qualify as under the influence. But he’d bought 
those two fifths of whiskey the night before he died. When his body was 
found, one bottle was sitting empty in the wastebasket; the other was on a 
shelf, only a third full. If Tenerelli didn’t drink all that whiskey, who did? 

The documents made me wonder when exactly Bishop police and the 
coroner’s office had figured out the identity of the John Doe in their morgue. 
On October 17, a radiologist at Washington Hospital in Culver City 
examined X-rays of the John Doe sent to her by the Inyo County coroner. 
They were “similar or identical,” she wrote, to those of a patient who’d been 
operated on at the hospital after a motorcycle accident in ’64: Tenerelli. The 
Inyo coroner had been notified of the match “within twenty-four hours,” so 
they’d identified their John Doe as Tenerelli no later than October 18. And 
yet the chief of police had told the Inyo Register that the identification came 


ten days later, on October 28. 

The Inyo County Sheriff’s Office was investigating the case from the 
other side: they’d found Tenerelli’s totaled Beetle in the desert, and they 
wanted to know where he’d gone. Documents from their investigation 
suggested that the coroner’s office withheld information from them. When an 
Inyo detective asked about Bishop’s John Doe on October 28, Brune didn’t 
tell him they’d identified the victim nearly two weeks earlier. 

Had Brune deliberately kept this from the sheriff? Why wasn’t Tenerelli’s 
identification shared with the other agencies—or his own family—sooner? I 
could never ask Brune. Neither he nor Crom spoke to me again. 

Robert Denton, the surgeon who’d conducted Tenerelli’s autopsy, told me 
he’d never believed the case was a suicide; he only called it that under 
pressure from the coroner’s office. Looking over his own report, Denton said, 
“See where I wrote, ‘This man seems to be a suicide’? I wasn’t happy with 
this. That’s why I wrote seems.” He shook his head. “There were bum things 
going on here.” It appeared to him now, as it probably did then, that Tenerelli 
had been “in a fight or dragged” before he was shot. In those days, he said, a 
lot of “questionable deaths” were “signed off as suicides”: “It was too 
expensive to investigate... People didn’t want to be involved.” 


On the other side, the sheriffs and the California Highway Patrol were 
looking into the abandoned Volkswagen with blood on its interior. 

A report filed by one of the sheriff’s deputies on October 5 said, “From 
indications at the scene... the vehicle has not been at the location for more 
than two days.” If that was true, Tenerelli couldn’t have dumped the car. His 
body had been found three days earlier, on October 2, and the estimated time 
of death was between 9:30 and 10:30 p.m., October 1. 

And yet all the newspapers, working on information from the police, 
reported that Tenerelli had ditched his car there after a failed suicide attempt. 
Why did police concoct this story when they knew it couldn’t be true? 

There were clues among the evidence recovered from the scene near the 
car. Cops found a pickax and a shovel with a broken handle, as well as beer 
and soda bottles—all covered in what was thought to be Tenerelli’s blood. 
Then there was a cache of unused shotgun shells, a loaf of French bread and a 
package of lunch meat, maps, “miscellaneous papers,” and several documents 


indicating that Tenerelli might not have been alone in the car: a “meal” and 
“laundry” sheet from Brentwood Hospital, where he had neither worked nor 
been a patient; and a Santa Monica bus schedule, which he wouldn’t have 
needed because he owned a car and a motorcycle. 

The two hunters who’d chanced upon Tenerelli’s car had observed 
someone “coming up from the wreck” as they climbed down to it, sheriffs’ 
reports said. There was far more blood in and around the vehicle than the 
papers had reported: blood on the fender and bumper, inside the driver’s-side 
door and under the dash, palm prints in dried blood, scratch marks going 
through the dried blood... a lot of blood from just one man who had no 
noticeable wounds when he arrived in Bishop. Bee Greer had told police that 
when she talked to Tenerelli he “seemed quite natural and told her that he 
was here to look the area over and possibly find a job.” If the coroner’s time 
of death was correct, Tenerelli had shaved his pubes, downed a bottle and a 
half of whiskey, and shot himself within two hours of that conversation. 

Meanwhile, memos from the California Highway Patrol suggested 
suspects for the murder: the group of hippie car thieves they’d recently taken 
into custody. In Bishop, “around the 1st of October,” a highway patrolman 
had stopped a “late model” blue Volkswagen; Tenerelli drove a ’69 blue 
Volkswagen, and October 1 was the day before his body was found. The 
patrolman questioned the driver, who, like his two male passengers, was a 
“hippie” type. Later, investigators showed the patrolman a photograph of the 
Family, including Manson, Steven Grogan, and Danny DeCarlo. He “was 
sure” that DeCarlo was the driver of the car. 

The report continued: “Even though Tenerelli was supposed to be a 
definite suicide, perhaps Bishop PD would be interested, especially if we can 
place DiCarlo [sic] in Bishop after 9-29-69 and prior to or on 10-1-69.” I 
checked, and DeCarlo was in Death Valley on exactly the dates in question. 
But there was no indication that the Highway Patrol had shared their findings 
with the Bishop Police Department. 

Records from the Inyo District Attorney contained a morgue photograph 
of Tenerelli’s face, with a note attached. DAs wanted to find another photo of 
Tenerelli to show to “Kitty”: the Family’s Kitty Lutesinger, who’d run away 
from Death Valley before her friends were caught, and who’d briefly 
cooperated with investigators. If she told detectives anything about Tenerelli, 
we'll probably never know—there were no other documents linking the two, 


and she refused to speak to me when I knocked on her door in 2008. 


Neither of the officers who investigated Tenerelli’s abandoned Volkswagen 
believed he committed suicide. One of them, the California Highway Patrol’s 
Doug Manning, called the official story “a bunch of malarkey.” The other, 
Inyo sheriff’s deputy Dennis Cox, called it “bullshit.” 

Cox was sure the car was “dumped” in Death Valley after Tenerelli’s 
death in Bishop. He’d been to Father Crowley Point the day before the 
hunters discovered the Beetle, and “it wasn’t there.” After the Manson 
Family was arrested for their auto-theft ring, one of the girls told 
investigators that she was “involved” with Tenerelli, and that he’d been with 
the Family in Death Valley before his death. But Cox couldn’t remember 
who’d said that. 

When police in Death Valley finally captured the Family, they’d been 
tracking the group’s car thefts and burglaries since September 29 at the latest. 
They might not have known yet that their suspects were killers, but they did 
know that they’d been stealing vehicles all over Inyo County, with a special 
predilection for Volkswagen Beetles, which they liked to convert into dune 
buggies for use in the rugged desert terrain. 

One last thing bothered me: the pubic hair. If, as police reports stated, 
Tenerelli had shaved his pubes just before killing himself, and a “few 
strands” had been found “between the pages” of a Playboy magazine—what 
happened to the rest? The Family’s Bill Vance had a “magic vest” he liked to 
wear that was “made of pubic hair,” per a report from the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff’s Office. The LASO report never said where the pubic hair 
came from—and how could it, really?—but I found it relevant that Vance, an 
associate of Manson from prison, was arrested for stealing a gun from a car in 
Death Valley on October 5, 1969, the day Tenerelli’s car was pulled from the 
nearby ravine. 


Coda: “Out of the Loop” 


In January 2008, Bishop’s new chief of police, Kathleen Sheehan, called to 
say she’d heard about my investigation from Debra Tate. In light of my 
findings she was reopening the investigation into Tenerelli’s death. She 


assigned a homicide detective, David Jepson, to the case, asking me to share 
my findings with him. “Murder doesn’t happen every day around here,” she 
said. 

I was happy to help. For once, I thought my reporting might yield positive 
results, rather than dead ends and obfuscation. Jepson and I spoke on the 
phone more than a dozen times before he decided to visit me in L.A. That 
July, he and his superior, Chris Carter, drove 275 miles to meet with me in 
the dining room of the Embassy Suites Hotel in El Segundo. 

During our four-hour meeting, which Jepson recorded, I showed them 
everything. Both officers agreed that the death was a “probable” murder and 
vowed to continue their investigation in Bishop. Carter said he didn’t 
“believe in coincidences,” and there were “too many” here. But toward the 
end of the meeting they turned off the recorder and made an odd request. 

Carter asked me to copy the documents I’d shared that day and mail the 
file to a “personal” P.O. box in Bishop. The detectives were concerned that 
their chief, Sheehan, would use this case to get publicity. They wanted to 
keep her “out of the loop on this one” until the investigation was over. 

I didn’t like the sound of that, and I told them so. Sheehan had been the 
one who reopened the case. We wouldn’t be meeting if not for her. 

Making sure the recorder was still off, Carter said he believed Sheehan 
would “kill the investigation” if she found out that “it involved a cover-up or 
even incompetence.” And the mayor, Frank Crom—who’d already tried to 
persuade me to leave well enough alone—would “pull the plug if [we] 
discover cover-up aspects.” The detectives assured me they’d prevent any 
derailment of the investigation, and they promised to share anything new they 
uncovered. Against my better instincts, I agreed to continue cooperating with 
them. 

That was a big mistake. I never heard from either officer again. Through 
intermediaries, I learned they were telling people in Bishop that their 
investigation had turned up no pursuable evidence and the case had been 
closed. 

The three of us had discussed people they’d want to interview when they 
returned to Bishop. I called a lot of those people—they’d never heard from 
the detectives. In fact, in the six months between the reopening of the case 
and their visit to me in L.A., they had interviewed only three people. That 
number never went up. According to the scant record Jepson finally shared 


with me in 2011, he never conducted another interview after our meeting. 

When I finally got Jepson on the phone, I reminded him that he’d 
promised to share his findings with me. He said his files were in a storage 
shed in his backyard. It took him weeks to dig through this shed. Because I 
kept leaving him messages, he eventually called me back and, sounding 
triumphant, told me that he’d found one of his notebooks. He faxed me the 
pages from it: they covered the same period I already knew about, during 
which he’d spoken to all of three people. Jepson was sure there were later 
interviews, but he kept searching in his shed, and nothing turned up. 

I had to ask if the investigation had been quashed, as he and Carter had 
warned it would be if it disclosed a “cover-up” or “incompetence” in the old 
department. 

After a lot of prodding, Jepson recalled “conversations” at the police 
department before their meeting with me—something to the effect that they 
weren’t going to have “people come up here and smear a retired lieutenant’s 
[Frank Crom’s] name and smear the department.” 

I knew I had to go to Jepson’s superiors, beginning with Sheehan. By then 
she’d left Bishop to become chief of police in Port Hueneme, another small 
town in California. Although she sounded happy to hear from me again on 
the phone, by the time I drove out to see her the next day, her mood had 
darkened. Like Jepson, she said the investigation was over, and that was all 
there was to it. When I explained that Carter and Jepson had said that she 
craved publicity and should be kept “out of the loop,” she didn’t believe it. I 
showed her my notes from that meeting, and she accused me of fabricating 
them. I’d seen these reversals many times before, almost exclusively from 
law enforcement officials. But Sheehan’s was so abrupt, so hard, that I left 
her office shaken—whatever had happened in Bishop, I believed she was a 
part of it. 

Chris Carter, who’d succeeded Sheehan as chief of the Bishop Police 
Department, was clearly prepared for my call. He denied everything he’d said 
to me in L.A. while his recorder was off. I asked for a copy of the tape—he’d 
be happy to provide it. I knew he’d made his incriminating remarks when the 
recorder wasn’t running, I said, but I still expected to hear the click of the 
machine going off and on again. I should’ve kept that to myself. Two weeks 
later, when I called again, he claimed the tape had been lost or destroyed. 

Nevertheless, I filed an Open Records Act Request with the Bishop Police 


Department for all files on their reinvestigation of the Tenerelli death. I 
received a response saying no records had been found. 

Through all this, I never stopped thinking of Tenerelli’s mother, Caterina, 
whom I’d met in 2008, when she was ninety-four. With one of her daughters 
translating her Italian, she told me she never accepted that her son killed 
himself. She believed God had kept her alive to learn the truth about him. But 
she’d died at ninety-nine, never knowing the answers. 


Paul Dostie, the detective with the cadaver dog, had no better luck than I did. 
The sheriff halted his dig in Death Valley after less than two feet of earth had 
been removed. 

And now my book was even more overdue than my article to Premiere 
had ever been. Penguin had granted me extension after extension, approving 
another advance payment to me to keep me afloat. In the meantime, my 
editor had left the house, and the 2008 recession had editorial departments 
tightening their belts. Author contracts had once come with implicit latitude. 
Now, with lots of money on the line, editors wanted something to show for 
their investments, especially when an untested writer had received a 
significant advance. 

The fortieth anniversary of the Tate-—LaBianca murders came and went. It 
had now been ten years since my report for Premiere was supposed to 
appear. The magazine didn’t even exist anymore. On cable news, my fellow 
reporters and dozens of my interview subjects showed up as talking heads, 
discussing the continuing significance of the murders. There was Bugliosi, 
still hawking Helter Skelter, calling the crimes “revolutionary, political.” 

I fumbled and fiddled, trying to find a workable structure for the book. 
Should it begin with MKULTRA? The night of the Tate murders? No matter 
where I dropped in, I tripped myself up with parentheticals and long 
digressions; there was no Starting point that didn’t entail a herculean amount 
of exposition. I sent in outlines, synopses, addenda, half-starts, revised 
proposals. None of them hit the mark, and I knew that. I’d come to feel like a 
prisoner of my own story. Everyone agreed that it would make for an 
outstanding book; no one, least of all me, could describe what that book 
might look like, or how it would accommodate a plot that had no end. By 
2011, I’d taken so long to deliver that my original editor had come back to 


Penguin. He proposed bringing on a collaborator, someone who could 
metabolize my reporting into a cogent narrative. 

I was all for it. Penguin helped me find an ideal candidate: a journalist 
with decades of political reporting and many books under his belt, someone 
with experience and sangfroid. When he signed on, I felt like I could see a 
lifeboat on the horizon. He wrote yet another synopsis, one that yielded the 
first unabashedly positive note from Penguin I’d gotten in years. “We find 
this very encouraging: full speed ahead.” 

That was in October 2011. By December, he’d quit. Our deadline—the 
last one—was only six months away, and now I was flying solo. 

After he walked, Penguin offered to buy me out. If I let someone else 
write the book—completely—I’d receive no more money, no credit, no input, 
nothing. All I’d get was the portion of the advance I’d already received—and 
spent, years before, on nothing but reporting the book. I told my agent to tell 
them to go to hell. 

I decided to use those remaining six months to write the book myself. 
Before he’d even seen my manuscript, my editor warned that there was only 
a one in a million chance they wouldn’t reject it. I typed out pages in furious 
haste. I tried to be thorough, to be linear. I wrote in the first person, hoping to 
give readers a sense of what I’d been thinking. And in June 2012, I turned in 
what I had: 129 pages, single-spaced, amounting to 117,228 words. It 
covered barely the first three months of my reporting. 

If you’ve inspected the spine of this book, you’ve already noticed that the 
Penguin Press colophon isn’t on it. They canceled the book. I like to believe 
my editor was sorry it came to this, and that he believed in the project. I don’t 
believe Penguin’s lawyers shared his sorrow—they wanted their money back. 
If I didn’t pay up by the start of 2013, they would have no choice but to sue 
me. 

I didn’t have that money, of course. I’d been living on it, as the publisher 
had intended me to, for years. A few months earlier, I’d been hoping to repay 
my parents for their loan. Now I was in the hole with them and one of the 
biggest publishers in the world. In 2012, I became one of a dozen authors 
Penguin sued for failing to deliver manuscripts. Most were far more 
established than I was. The lawsuits sent waves of panic through the industry. 
Even though mine was for the most money, it came half a year later than the 
others, and so, mercifully, it didn’t make the papers. That was one 


humiliation I was spared. 

But I was still devastated. I felt like I’d failed everyone. I had one job to 
do, and I hadn’t done it. Paul Krassner, the journalist who’d warned me that 
the story would “take over my life,” was more than right: it had chewed me 
up and spit me out. I didn’t know how I could ever report on anything else 
now. My agent shopped the book around to other publishers, and while a few 
were interested in buying the rights, the offers never materialized. Some 
documentary filmmakers had courted me, too, and one, an Oscar winner, 
went so far as to make some test footage, which he sold as a series to a 
premium cable station. But there, too, things fell apart. In all honesty, though, 
I was the one who backed out of these projects. Inevitably, the conversations 
ran aground on questions of ownership—some legal, others more figurative. 
Whose story was this? How far did you have to step back before you could fit 
a frame around it? And, of course: Where did it all go? 

I remember a day soon after the deal fell apart. My neighbor, a good 
friend, was walking his dogs and saw me sitting outside, looking miserable. 
He invited me to join him. After trying to distract me with pleasantries for a 
while, he turned the conversation to the lawsuit. 

“Do you regret all this?” he asked. 

“Not at all,” I said. I shocked myself with my answer, but I really believed 
it. “This has been the most exciting thirteen years of my life. There’s nothing 
like the adrenaline rush of catching these people in lies, and documenting it— 
knowing that you’ve found something no one else has found.” 

I kept little pieces of cardboard around my office. Sometimes I folded 
them up and carried them in my pocket. Whenever I started doubting myself, 
which was a lot, I had a list of bullet points I’d write down on them and read 
to myself for encouragement—a reminder of what I’d discovered that no one 
else had, what I knew I had to share with the world. Like: Stephen Kay 
telling me that my findings were important enough to overturn the verdicts. 
Lewis Watnick, the retired DA, saying that Manson had to be an informant. 
Jolly West writing to his CIA handlers to announce that he’d implanted a 
false memory in someone; the CIA removing that information from the report 
they shared with Congress. The DA’s office conspiring with a judge to 
replace a defense attorney. Charlie Guenther, fighting back tears to tell me 
about the wiretap he’d heard. People had confided in me. Pd wrested 
documents from places other reporters had never penetrated. What did it 


mean, and what would I do with it? 

When I got back from the walk with my neighbor that day, I fished out 
one of the cardboard squares and read the bullet points again. Each one set 
off a chain of reminders to myself: People I needed to call. FOIA requests I 
had to follow up on. A new book on the CIA I hadn’t read yet. A retired 
detective whose files were probably, at this very second, quietly turning to 
dust in his garage... 

What else could I do? 

I kept reporting. 


EPILOGUE 


The Manson murders have an aura of finality. In 2016, The Guardian 


marveled at how they compel us despite “the lack of any meaty mystery”: 
“There are no questions about what happened... We know pretty much 
exactly who did what to whom, when and why.” In a sense, that’s true: the 
material evidence is sickeningly conclusive, and it still shocks today. But it 
doesn’t make sense. The mystery is there. 

In my nearly twenty years of reporting on this case, people have asked me 
all the time: What do I think really happened? I hate that question more than 
anything. The plain answer is, I don’t know. I worry that as soon as I 
speculate, I undermine the work I’ve done. In a sense, had I been more 
willing to fill in the blanks, I might’ve finished this book a lot sooner. 

That’s not to say I haven’t entertained a lot of pet theories over the years. 
They’ve fallen in and out of favor as I learned more or shifted my focus. For 
a while, I was convinced the victims at the Tate and LaBianca houses knew 
their killers in the Family, that they’d been targeted—maybe not by the girls, 
but by Manson and Tex Watson. It may have had something to do with a 
drug burn, or an unknown middleman with connections to Hollywood. Or 
there’s the possibility that the Family was caught up in a CHAOS or 
COINTELPRO operation, goaded into violence as sheriff’s deputies and the 
LAPD looked the other way, necessitating a cover-up. And there’s the most 
“far out” theory: that Manson was tied to an MKULTRA effort to create 
assassins who would kill on command. 

It’s when someone claims that I’ve “found the truth” that I get anxious. I 
haven’t found the truth, much as I wish I could say I have. My goal isn’t to 
say what did happen—it’s to prove that the official story didn’t. I’ve learned 
to accept the ambiguity. I had to, I realized, if I ever wanted to finish this 


book. For every chapter here, there are a dozen I’ve left out. There’s more, 
there’s always more. 

But I haven’t stopped trying. If there’s hope anywhere, it’s in the 
documents. I remain shocked by the state’s lack of transparency. For reasons 
I can’t understand, district attorneys, law enforcement agencies, federal 
bureaus, and other outposts of officialdom continue to suppress their files, 
even as they claim they have nothing to hide. 

This position assumes a certain amount of complacency in the public. If 
the truth turns out to exist on a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy, on 
the 3,005th page of a transcript so dry that no one has read it from start to 
finish, they’re counting on our not caring. To get to that kernel of truth, you 
have to generate a paper trail of your own: of FOIA requests, public hearings, 
and concemed letters to your congressperson, all eventually housed in their 
own sleepy archives. 

As of this writing, the LAPD and the DA’s office are still in legal battles 
about their unfathomable refusal to release information—a refusal that 
extends to the victims’ families and to the defendants themselves. 

The latest front is a battle over the Tex Watson tapes. Less than two 
weeks before the Family’s capture in the desert. Watson absconded to his 
parents’ place in Copeville, Texas. On November 30, 1969, he turned himself 
in for questioning after learning that two LAPD detectives were on a plane 
heading his way. He got a lawyer, Bill Boyd, of Dallas, who sat him down to 
make a taped confession. This is, as far as anyone knows, the first known 
recorded account of the crimes—before Bugliosi or anyone else could impose 
narrative order on it. It’s all the more valuable because Watson hadn’t even 
been identified as a suspect yet. He was speaking of his own accord to his 
lawyer, not as a man defending himself to the police. 

According to Boyd, Watson described the duration of his time with the 
Family and, in chilling detail, the killing of Tate and the other victims. He 
was “very straightforward” and “candid” about his involvement in the crimes, 
Boyd told me. He also described other murders that the group committed. 
murders that hadn’t been discovered. 

In 2009, Boyd agreed to let me listen to the tapes, but only with Watson’s 
permission, which I knew he’d never get. He wouldn’t go into granular detail 
about them, perhaps realizing that he’d already violated Watson’s 
confidentiality. Boyd died a year after we spoke. By 2011, his law firm had 


gone bankrupt, and its holdings were in receivership—including the cassettes, 
which he’d kept in a safe in his office. 

A Dallas bankruptcy trustee had come into possession of the tapes, and 
she seemed on the verge of releasing them to me. Instead, she offered them to 
Patrick Sequeira, the deputy district attorney in L.A. who handled Watson’s 
parole hearings. Sequeira supported my effort to get them, and he assured me 
he’d let me hear them—‘“We wouldn’t even know they existed if it weren’t 
for you,” he said. Watson tried to halt their release, filing an injunction in 
Texas and setting off a yearlong battle. The DA’s office won. But since 
gaining custody of the recordings, they have been played for no one outside 
the justice system, not even the victims’ families, who asked to hear them. 
The DA’s office and the LAPD have released only minimal and at times 
contradictory statements about their content. 

Sequeira told me there were no unknown homicides mentioned on them— 
there was nothing new at all. But if the DA’s office released them to me, 
they’d have to release them to everyone, and they didn’t want the information 
to be distorted by the public. Soon after, he cut off communications with me. 

Richard Pfeiffer, the attorney for Leslie Van Houten, wanted to hear the 
tapes, too—what if they contained exculpatory information that could be used 
at parole hearings? Pfeiffer tried to get them but to no avail. Soon the DA’s 
office trotted out a different reason for not releasing them: “There are 
unsolved crimes Manson Family members are suspected of committing. The 
information in the tape(s) are part of the investigation of those crimes and 
could be used to solve them.” 

The case reached the California Supreme Court. Pfeiffer suggested that 
the judge could review the tapes and make his own decision. But the DA’s 
office did not “believe it necessary for the court to arduously labor through 
the 326 pages of [Watson’s] rambling musings.” The court decided in the 
DA’s favor. Since then, Leslie Van Houten has been approved for parole for 
the first time ever. California’s governor at the time, Jerry Brown, vetoed her 
release on the recommendation of the DA’s office. Although Pfeiffer made it 
clear that it was his idea to go after the tapes, the DAs had lambasted Van 
Houten for trying to get them, saying it was clear evidence that she still 
hadn’t accepted full responsibility for her crimes. 

Pfeiffer vowed to go back to court and get the tapes, and he’s pursued a 
number of legal avenues, all unsuccessful, thus far. To this day, the DA’s 


office is guarding them with more fervor than ever. I keep the parole hearings 
in my calendar, making sure to get transcripts of them as soon as they’re 
available. At these hearings, the state tries to turn the mind-bending events of 
August 9, 1969, into inert history—and they’re one of the only places left to 
hope for the truth. 


Whenever I tell people about my work, they want to know if I interviewed 
Charles Manson himself. I did, over the phone, in 2000. Our first 
conversation, disconcertingly enough, was on Valentine’s Day. 

Our exchanges were mediated through two of Manson’s associates, Pin 
Cushion and Gray Wolf. The former, nicknamed for the frequency with 
which he’d been stabbed, was born Roger Dale Smith. He was Manson’s guy 
on the inside, his prison gofer. The latter, born Craig Hammond, had been 
anointed Gray Wolf by Manson himself, and brokered all outside access to 
Manson. A retiree, he’d moved to Hanford, California, decades earlier just to 
be near the prison that housed Manson, whom he believed to possess “deep 
insight into environmental issues.” (Many of Manson’s latter-day followers 
claimed to be enchanted by his ecological “ATWA” philosophy—“Air, 
Trees, Water, Animals,” or “All the Way Alive”—through which he endorsed 
the use of a seed gun called “the Savior” to repopulate California’s plant 
species.) Later, Hammond was arrested for smuggling a cell phone to 
Manson in prison. A few years after that, when Manson had gotten engaged 
to a young woman named Star, he discovered that Hammond had been 
sleeping with her, and rechristened him “Dead Rat.” 

In 2000, when Gray Wolf set up my interview, he urged me to “protect 
myself.” “You don’t know what powers are pushing against you,” he said. 

He patched me through to Pin Cushion, who put on Manson himself. We 
would have five minutes to talk before the prison terminated the call 
automatically. 

“Hello, Tom,” Manson said. 

“Hi, Charlie, how you doing?” 

“Aw, hanging loose, man.” 

“Happy Valentine’s Day,” I said. 

“Yeah, same to you, man.” 

Pd only caught Manson’s interest because his handlers had told him I had 


information about potential perjury during the trial—Terry Melcher’s. But 
now that I had him on the line, he wanted to talk about anything but Terry 
Melcher. I gave him a brief introduction to my angle for Premiere, which he 
dismissed as “hype.” He wanted me to speak “to the heart.” I rattled off a list 
of names to see if he knew them. 

“T don’t know anyone, man,” he said. “I barely know myself.” 

Manson spoke in riddles when he spoke at all. He claimed that there was a 
lot of money behind the murders, and that the “United States Navy” held the 
purse strings. “I’m Vincent Bugliosi’s godfather,” he said. But he wasn’t a 
snitch, so he wasn’t going to give me any names. “There’s a lot of people 
playing a lot of games, man,” he said. He added: “I pitched horseshoes when 
I was seventeen.” 

Whenever he didn’t feel like answering, he’d say something like that. “I 
got five red wheels on that truck.” Or: “When Reagan went to Greenland we 
locked all the weather stations to the heart project.” 

Our five minutes vanished before I even got my bearings. Hammond 
dialed again. If I wanted to connect with Charlie, he said, I had to show him 
my human side, my heart. I took a breath while Manson got back on the line. 

“Look it, man,” he said. “See, I have no way of knowing what you’re 
biting into.” 

I tried again to explain. Even in Manson’s more lucid moments, the only 
thing we saw eye to eye on was that the prosecution had played dirty. But he 
didn’t think Melcher was the problem—“‘“He didn’t say anything.” He seemed 
to have written Melcher off. “The simplicity of the whole thing is that Terry 
gave his word for something,” he said, “and he didn’t do it, and we didn’t 
realize that the Korean War was lost.” To him, the real villain was Linda 
Kasabian, his lapsed follower, who’d flipped for the prosecution. 

“She gave the souls of her children up to the devil in a sacrificial trip that 
came down in an agreement with the universal mind,” he explained. “You 
just tell her that the key to Red Skelton’s house is in the ventilator and it’s 
still there. And that crypt is still there with the dogs at attention.” 

Our time was nearly up again. Manson passed the phone back to Pin 
Cushion, who offered to write down my remaining questions and send me 
Manson’s answers, verbatim. 

But the next night, Gray Wolf called and said that would never happen. 
Manson—who was apparently much less gnomic with his friends than he’d 


been with me—was upset with me. He and Pin Cushion wouldn’t talk again 
or send answers. Gray Wolf seemed surprised by all of it. He wasn’t used to 
Manson taking calls from journalists, and he said that he, too, was still 
processing everything he’d heard last night, as if some of it had been news to 
him. I wondered if this had more to do with Pin Cushion, who’d made some 
bold claims as he’d jotted down my questions. He said Manson personally 
knew Mama Cass Elliot. He’d brought his girls to orgies for the Hollywood 
elite. He’d left a bunch of “bodies out in that motherfucking desert, man!” 
And, most mystifying of all, other members of the Family may have gone to 
the Tate house the night she was killed. I wondered if Manson had been 
standing next to him while he said all this, and gotten angry afterward. 

In 2008, I reached out to Manson again through Gray Wolf. This was after 
my many run-ins with Manson’s former followers, many of whom were not 
as former as I thought. The people I’d asked about Filippo Tenerelli and other 
possible victims must have relayed those communications to Manson. Gray 
Wolf told me never to get in touch again. 

“People are upset with you and you’re in trouble,” he said. “You don’t 
have permission to do what you’re doing.” He wouldn’t say more. I was cut 
off. “And I don’t know you,” he added. He hung up. 

So concluded my dealings with Charles Manson and his inner circle. 
When Manson died, in November 2017, the moment aroused little feeling in 
me. My investigation orbited him, but he mattered hardly at all to me. At 
some point, as a cottage industry rose up around him and he became a true- 
crime icon, he’d been made brittle, toothless. His image had become a 
repository for our fears. Everyone preferred the idea of him to the reality, and 
in death, he was more ideal than ever: the killer hippie from the sixties, a 
decade that feels further removed from the present than many that occurred 
before it. 

Always willing to play the madman, he slipped too easily into our 
understanding of the criminal mastermind. In that rictus of his, those glinting 
eyes, the X carved into his forehead, we’re supposed to recognize what 
Bugliosi famously called “a metaphor for evil.” But the full extent of that evil 
isn’t in what we know about Manson. It’s in what we don’t know. That’s 
what kept me going all these years, even when I was broke, even when 
people said I was crazy, even when I had death threats lobbed at me. 

As Manson said to me with an air of disgust: “The bottom line is that you 


want information.” 
“Exactly,” I said.

My Good Friend: 


I returned from a brief vacation in Maine to find your letter of 11 June 
on my desk. I had been awaiting your next communication with considerable 
anticipation and curiosity. Frankly, I had been wondering whether your ap- 
parent rapid and camprehensive grasp of our problems could possibly be real. 
A considerable portion of your letter indicated that you have indeed develop- 
ed an admirably accurate picture of exactly what we are after. For this I 
am deeply grateful. 


I am proceeding to take action on developing a practical modus operandi 
in the following way: 


(1) I am-today dispatching a letter to Dr. Hastings enclosing a copy 
of your communication and suggesting to him an early conference here in order 
to make our initial assault on the top brass in your outfit. 

(2) In regard to the remarks you make about the advisability of your 
having some leeway in this purchase let me advise that it will be possible 
to setup a separate sum of money to be given to you personally for such 
matters. 

(3) It seems to me that it would be useful for me to obtain Top Secret 
clearance from our organization for Steele, Brua and Cowles. We may not favor 
to bring them in on the whole story but it would be wise to be in a position 
to do so when and if this becomes necessary. For this purpose I would appre- 
ciate receiving by return mail the following information on each of these 
personalities. 


Their date of birth 
c) Their title of their present job 
(a) Their serial number 


i) Their full name and title 


I gather from your letter that you do not look with favor on attempts 
to have you maneuvered out of the Air Force very soon. This would be difficult 
to do in any case but I want to know from you whether or not Hastings and I 
should posSems this as an alternative to the top brass here in the eventuality 
fine they think it impossible to develop this project within the Air Force 
structure.

The twenty-year journey culminating in this book began with a phone call 
from Leslie Van Buskirk at Premiere magazine. For that I am forever grateful 
and, yeah, sometimes resentful. Jim Meigs bet the bank on this—I wish he 
could’ve stuck around to the end, but who wants to live with Manson that 
long, except for me? Others at Premiere who kept me on my toes for nearly 
two years were Kathy Heintzelmen and Anne Thompson. 

Without my agent, Sloan Harris of ICM, this book wouldn’t exist. His 
tenacity and faith—not to mention his extraordinary ability to think outside 
the box when cancelations, lawsuits, and threats became routine—should be 
enshrined in the Agentry Hall of Fame. Also life-preserving at ICM were 
Sloan’s assistants over the years: Kristyn Keene, Heather Karpas, and Alexa 
Brahme. Kudos, too, to the lawyers who kept me out of jail or, at least, 
bankruptcy court: John DeLaney and Heather Bushong. And to Rich Green, 
Michael McCormick, and Will Watkins, who wrangled much-needed 
sustenance from Hollywood. 

At Little, Brown, editor-in-chief Judy Clain went where others before her 
wouldn’t (or did, then fled). Reagan Arthur bravely put pen to paper, making 
it real. Their team—Alex Hoopes, Katharine Myers, Alyssa Persons, Ira 
Boudah, Ben Allen, Trent Duffy, and Lauren Harms—pulled off the amazing 
feat of producing and publicizing this book. Thanks also to Eric Rayman and 
Carol Ross, whose close reading safeguarded (hopefully) my future mobility. 

When you work on a book for twenty years—examining crimes that 
occurred decades prior—you lose many of your sources along the way. 
Among the many who are no longer with us, but who must be acknowledged 
for excavating memories of a dark, horrifying time, are: Rudi Altobelli, Bill 
Garretson, Elaine Young, Dominick Dunne, Bill Tennant, Shahrokh Hatami, 
Richard and Paul Sylbert, Polly Platt, Charles Eastman, Julia Phillips, Denny 


Doherty, Christopher Jones, Gene Gutowski, and Victor Lownes.

Guenther, Paul Whiteley, Bill Gleason, Preston Guillory, Mike and Elsa 
McGann, Danny Bowser, Paul Caruso, Gerald and Milton Condon, Paul 
Fitzgerald, Lewis Watnick, Buck Compton, and George Denny. 

To thank everyone I interviewed would require dozens of pages—and 
many of my sources never appear in this book. PI limit this list to the ones 
who endured my inquiries for years, if not decades, and who deserve 
accolades for their patience.

Thornton, Gerald O’ Neill, and Ray Sherrard. Los Angeles District Attorney’s 
office: Stephen Kay, Burton Katz, Jeff Jonas, Robert Schirn, Ronald Ross,

capture of the Family in Death Valley, thanks also to former Death Valley 
National Park superintendent (and author of the indispensable Desert 
Shadows) Bob Murphy, and Parks Department rangers Homer Leach, Al 
Schneider, Paul Fodor, Don Carney, and Richard Powell. And thanks to 
Darlene Ward, the daughter of late Inyo deputy sheriff Don Ward. 

The Tenerelli case would’ve remained in the shadows were it not for the 
invaluable assistance of Bee and Kermit Greer, Robert Denton, and Billy 
Kriens, the original investigating officer at the Sportsman’s Lodge. A special 
thank you to Sue Norris, a medical doctor with experience in forensic 
pathology who provided a detailed analysis of the Tenerelli coroner’s 
findings. Finally, while I wasn’t able to comfort Filippo’s mother, Caterina, 
with a final answer about what happened to her son, I hope I have provided 
some solace to his sisters, Angela, Lucia, Maria, and Chiara, and his nieces 
and nephews, especially Cosimo Giovane, who has worked so tirelessly to 
have the cause of death on his uncle’s death certificate changed from 
“suicide” to “unknown.” 


Lastly, in Inyo, a heartfelt expression of gratitude to Paul Dostie, who has 
committed the last twelve years of his life to searching for the remains of 
possible unidentified victims of the Manson Family. 

My detour into the murky world of government intelligence and covert 
operations would have been impossible without the pioneering work of 
previous CHAOS, COINTELPRO, and MKULTRA authors and researchers, 
many of whom provided guidance, moral support, and files. Among those 
who offered generous help are Eric Olson, John Marks, Alan Scheflin, Doug 
Valentine, Dick Russell, Sid Bender, William Turner, Peter Dale Scott, John 
Judge, Rex Bradford, Larry Hancock, John Kelly, Phil Melanson, Robert 
Blair Keiser, Shane O’Sullivan, Brad Johnson, Jim DiEugenio, and Rose 
Lynn Mangan. 

Especially helpful in my investigation of Reeve Whitson was his 
daughter, Liza, and his former wife, Ellen. Likewise, thanks to Cindy 
Hancock and Margot Silverman for welcoming me into their homes and 
opening their fathers’ (William Herrmann and Charles Tacot, respectively) 
files. A big thanks also to Paul LePage Jr. for allowing access to his late 
father’s files, and to Joseph Boskin, who served on the Riots and Disorders 
Task Force with William Herrmann and gave me his entire archive on the 
committee. 

I interviewed dozens of Jolly West’s colleagues and associates. I must 
express gratitude to the few who helped me understand him the most: 
Elizabeth “Libby” Price, Gilbert Rose, James R. Allen, and Margaret T. 
Singer, West’s partner in studying the returned prisoners of the Korean War 
who beseeched me not to publish the West-Gottlieb letters because they’d 
destroy “all the good research” they’d done “showing how brainwashing and 
thought reform works.” 

I talked to relatives of the doomed airman Jimmy Shaver and his victim, 
Chere Jo Horton. His sister, Brenda Hoff, shared family secrets with me as 
well as the absolute conviction that her brother did not wittingly kill Horton. 

Thanks to the archivists across the country who endured my unending 
requests: at the Los Angeles Court of Appeals, Oscar Gonzalez; Los Angeles 
Superior Court, Mark Hoffman and Don Camera; Federal Bureau of Prisons, 
Dana Hansen, Ben Kingsley, Traci Billingsly, and Ann Diestel; Federal 
Parole Office, Pamela Posch and Debbie Terrell; Inyo County District 
Attorney’s office, Janet and C.J.; University of Nevada Reno, Jacque 


Sundstrand; National Archives, Greg Badsher, Richard Boylan, Will 
Mahoney, John Taylor, Fred Romanski, Marjorie Ciralante, Martha Murphy, 
Marty McGann, Carl Wisenbach, Sam Bouchart, Ken Schlesinger, Rod Ross, 
Steve Tilley, Ramona Oliver, and Janis Wiggins; National Security Archive, 
Kevin Symonds; California State Archives, Linda Johnson; and the Special 
Collections Department of the Charles E. Young Library at UCLA, Charlotte 
Brown. 

Authors who shared information on the Manson case include Ivor Davis, 
Simon Wells, Greg King, Marlin Maryneck, Barney Hoskyns, and Paul 
Krassner. 

Independent researchers who helped me include Jedidiah Laub-Klein, 
Tommy Schwab, Jason Majik, Jon Aes-Nihil, John Michael Jones, and Mark 
Turner. Also Bo Edlund and Glenna Schultz, the proprietors of the best 
websites on the crimes, CieloDrive.com and TruthOnTateLaBianca.com, 
respectively. These two case “scholars” often found information I’d long 
given up on. Their knowledge on the crimes surpasses anyone I’ve 
encountered in my twenty years researching them. 

Helpful members and associates of the Family include Dean Moorehouse, 
Sherry Cooper, Catherine “Cappie” Gillies, Dianne Lake, Brooks Poston, 
Paul Crockett, Vern Plumlee, and Barbara Hoyt. There were also those who 
intersected with the group, including Bob Berry, Bob April, Charlie Melton, 
Corrine Broskette, Rosina Kroner, and Lee Saunooke. 

A host of my friends provided unwavering moral support—not to mention 
beds, couches, and floors when I turned up in their towns with a car full of 
files and addresses of local criminals I planned to confront. Among them (the 
friends, not the criminals) are Jenny Jedeikin, Patricia Harty, Holly Millea, 
Gail Gilchrist, Greg and Erin Fitzsimmons, Jay Russell, Lee Cunningham, 
Paul Lyons, Nick Smith, Jaceene Margolin, Jane Campbell, Daisy Foote, 
Mary Fitzgerald, Bryan Northam, Eileen O’Conner, Elaine DeBuhr, Daina 
Mileris, Beena Kamlani, Anne McDermott, Sean Jamison, Val Reitman, Kim 
Stevens, Karla Stevens, Fernando Arreola, Brad Verter, and Liz Heskin. 
Thanks also to Mike Gibbons (who gave me a car), Jesse Despard (who held 
forty boxes of my files in her basement for two years), Tim and Kyle 
Dilworth (basement storage for even more boxes), and Tim Guinee (an actor 
who roleplayed an antagonist with me in preparation for an interview). 

I’ve had the best researchers and tape transcribers, including Jim and Desi 


Jedeikin, Tanya McClure, Chris Kinker, Tucker Capps, Phil Brier, and Julie 
Tate. The one who hung in the longest and found out the most is Bob Perkins, 
a true investigator and an excellent writer. 

A few lawyers who provided invaluable support are Joe Weiner, David 
Feige, Richard Marks, Jessica Friedman, Paul McGuire, and Tim O’Conner. 
And some filmmakers who briefly journeyed with me as we pursued possible 
collaborations: Errol Morris, John Marks, and Ken Druckerman. 

In 2016, my collaborator, Dan Piepenbring, became the final component 
to finishing this odyssey, breathing life into my moribund pages, making 
sense of nonsense, and allowing me to see my findings again, with fresh eyes. 
For that, I will be forever indebted to the best collaborator an overwhelmed 
author could have. (Also thanks to Dan’s equally talented agent, Dan 
Kirschen of ICM.) 

But my deepest gratitude is reserved for two people without whose 
support I never would’ve survived these past twenty years: my father, 
William, who believed in the project from day one, even when others stopped 
believing; and my mother, Jean, who outlived him, making our joy at the 
conclusion bittersweet. My siblings, Bill, Tim, and Ellen, and their spouses 
and kids, were an enormous source of spiritual, sometimes financial, and 
(with Tim, particularly) legal sustenance. (Thank God there are three lawyers 
in my family, and thank God they were determined enough to keep me from 
moving into their basements to make sure all my contracts were ironclad and 
my lawsuits settled.) 

These acknowledgments would mean nothing without a word of thanks to 
the people who sacrificed, and continue to sacrifice, the most in this story. 
The survivors of the victims of the crimes described in these pages have to be 
reminded, yet again, of pain and trauma that needs no reminding. Their 
generosity and bravery never fail to humble me. Their grace in the face of 
such tragedy is a far greater testament to the lives of the loved ones they lost 
than any book could be. 

Thank you to the sister of John Philip Haught, Paula Scott Lowe, and to 
the mother of Marina Habe, Eloise Hardt, who died in 2017 at age ninety- 
nine, never knowing who killed her only child, and to Marina’s stepbrother 
and best friend, Mark McNamara. 

And my sincerest gratitude to the survivors of the known victims of the 
Manson group, who shared their stories with me: Frank Struthers, Suzanne 


LaBerge, Eva Morel, Janet Parent, and, especially, Anthony DiMaria and 
Debra Tate.

Prologue 


1 Vince’s own handwriting: Vincent Bugliosi interview with Terry Melcher, Los Angeles District 
Attorney’s office. 
2 I believed he’d framed Manson: Author interview with Rudolph Altobelli. 


1. The Crime of the Century 


Helter Skelter was published in 1974. An updated edition was published in 1994 to commemorate the 
twenty-fifth anniversary of the murders. All citations are from that 1994 edition. The accounts of the 
crimes and investigation in this chapter are taken from the trial transcripts and Helter Skelter. Where 
information is used from the trial transcript that was either not used or abridged by Bugliosi in Helter 
Skelter, that information will be cited. 

1 “a metaphor for evil”: Vincent Bugliosi with Curt Gentry, Helter Skelter (New York: Norton, 
1994), 640. 

2 “the dark and malignant side of humanity”: Bugliosi quoted in Richard C. Paddock, “The Long, 
Chilling Shadow of Charles Manson,” Los Angeles Times, Aug. 8, 1994. 

3 “We’re going to get some fucking pigs!”: Bugliosi and Gentry, Helter Skelter, 442.

of California Board of Prison Terms, in the Matter of the Life Term Parole Consideration Hearing 
of Susan Atkins, CDC Inmate W-08340, Dec. 16, 1988. 

5 “‘You’re going downhill’”: This and all quotations from the Manson trial in this chapter are from 
the court transcripts, California v. Charles Manson, Susan Atkins, Leslie Van Houten and Patricia 
Krenwinkel, case 22239. 

6 At the top of the driveway they found Steven Parent: I uncovered ample evidence suggesting that 
Parent’s relationship with William Garretson was significantly different than the one depicted at 
trial and in Helter Skelter, including the purpose of his visit to the guesthouse on August 8, 1969. 

7 put on “a crooked orbit.”: Steven V. Roberts, “Polanskis Were at Center of a Rootless Way of 
Life,” New York Times, Aug. 31, 1969.

Tate got the name from the house’s prior occupant, Candice Bergen.

18 “breaking off a minute piece”: Tex Watson and Chaplain Ray, Will You Die for Me? (Old Tappan, 
N.J.: Fleming H. Revell, 1978), 79. 

19 as many as thirty-three people: Bugliosi reported in Helter Skelter (615-16) that ranch hand Juan 
Flynn told him that Manson bragged that he had killed thirty-five people; Bugliosi believed the 
actual number might’ve been higher. 

20 “invitation to freedom”: “Hippies and Violence,” Time, Dec. 12, 1969. 

21 “I am a mechanical boy”: Watson and Ray, Will You Die for Me?, 80.

32 “even-toned arguments”: Associated Press, “Beatles Song Inspired Tate Murders, Says D.A.,” July 
24, 1970. 

33 That house was no longer occupied: I was able to document that the house was, in fact, occupied at 
the time, by the owner’s son, Leonard Posella. (His mother, the owner, lived in the guesthouse in 
the back.) 

34 a .38 revolver under his robes: Bugliosi and Gentry, Helter Skelter, 487.

Jul. 1, 2009. 

42 “Death? That’s what you’re all going to get”: Bugliosi and Gentry, Helter Skelter, 594. 


2. An Aura of Danger 


1 “unreality and hedonism”: Stephen V. Roberts, “Polanskis Were at Center of Rootless Way of 
Life,” New York Times, Aug. 31, 1969. 

2 “Los Angeles sewer system is stoned”: Thomas Thompson, “A Tragic Trip to the House on the 
Hill,” Life, Aug. 29, 1969. 

3 sound tests that supported Garretson: The police, nonetheless, were hardly convinced, as noted in 
the LAPD First Homicide Investigation Progress Report, DR 69-059-593 (p. 29): “It is highly 
unlikely that Garretson was not aware of the screams, gunshots and other turmoil that would result 
from a multiple homicide such as took place in his near proximity.” Stephen Kay told me he 
believed Garretson had fled the guesthouse during the murders and hid in the hills above the house. 
In interviews with me and other reporters before his death in 2017, Garretson claimed that he’d 
recovered memories of the night of the murders after seeing a reenactment on television in the 
1990s. He believed he’d been picked up by associates of the killers who were casing the house 
earlier that evening. He added that Barry Tarlow, the attorney who represented him at the time of 
his arrest, had said he’d been sent “by a friend,” refusing to identify who that “friend” was. 
(Tarlow’s office confirmed that he had been sent by a “friend,” but insisted he wasn’t paid and 
never learned the friend’s identity.) 

4 that a drug dealer had once been tied up: Among the books reporting this story are Steven Gaines, 
Heroes and Villains: The True Story of the Beach Boys (Boston: Da Capo, 1995), Barney Hoskyns, 
Waiting for the Sun: Strange Days, Weird Scenes, and the Sound of Los Angeles (New York: St. 
Martin’s, 1996), and Ed Sanders, The Family, 3rd ed. (New York: Thunder’s Mouth, 2002).

7 assigned the Tate murder case until November: Ibid., 166-67. 

8 Kaczanowski finally consented to be interviewed: The account of Kaczanowski’s interactions with 
the police, victims, Polanski, and original suspects comes from my interviews with Kaczanowski 
and the LAPD files on the case (provided by retired LAPD Sgt. Mike McGann). 

9 Billy Doyle, Tom Harrigan, and Pic Dawson: First Homicide Investigation Progress Report; 
individual subject interviews by LAPD; author interviews with William Tennant, Kaczanowski, 
Billy Doyle, Thomas Harrigan, and Charles Tacot.

14 denied knowing Kaczanowski at all: Roman Polanski, LAPD Polygraph Examination, Aug. 11, 
1969. 

15 a turbulent time at the Cielo house: The information in this chapter about the activities at Cielo 
Drive in the months leading up to the murders—including the details about the drug dealing by 
Doyle, Harrigan, Dawson, and Tacot—is from First Homicide Investigation Progress Report; 
LAPD Second Homicide Investigation Progress Report, DR 69-059-593; witness interviews by 
LAPD (from McGann files); numerous author interviews; and Helder and Tate, Five Down. 

16 “one of the most evil people”: Author interview with Judy Pierson.

30 Candice Bergen, in an interview with the LAPD: LAPD Interview with Bergen, #145, by Warren 
and Gilmore, Aug. 21, 1969. 

31 Dennis Hopper told the Los Angeles Free Press: Sanders, The Family, 195. Sanders says Hopper 
also told the Press that Doyle’s rape was filmed, quoting Hopper: “They had fallen into sadism and 
masochism and bestiality—and they recorded it all on videotape too. The L.A. police told me this. I 
know that three days before they were killed, twenty-five people were invited to that house to a 
mass whipping of a dealer from Sunset Strip who’d given them bad dope.” 

32 In short, he told: All quotations and summaries in this section are from Billy Doyle, LAPD 
Interrogation (transcript), by Earl Deemer, Aug. 28, 1969. 

33 “if they’d fucked me or not!”: Helder and Tate, Five Down, 63. 

34 Dawson had died: Fiegel, Dream a Little Dream, 143; “Harris Pickens Dawson, III” (obituary), 
Washington Post, Aug. 20, 1986. 

35 Harrigan was nowhere to be found: I did find and interview Harrigan, but not until 2014. 

36 “chained a sign to the tree”: Doyle, LAPD Interrogation transcript. 

37 No footage from this film has ever surfaced: Doyle admitted to me that the movie was a ruse, but 
gave differing reasons for the trip’s true purpose. Reed B. Mitchell, a Los Angeles disc jockey, told 
the LAPD that he’d been approached by Tacot before the murders “regarding a boat to bring back 
some drugs possibly [from] Jamaica” (Mitchell, LAPD Interview, #106, by Celmer, Burke, and 
Stanley, Aug. 19, 1969). 

38 “I took a lie-detector test,” Tacot told me: I have never been able to find this lie detector test, or any 
reference to a polygraph being administered to Tacot in the LAPD files. 

39 “You can’t kill somebody long-distance”: The LAPD was never able to corroborate that the two 
men were in Jamaica when the murders occurred. Several interview subjects told police they saw 
Doyle in Los Angeles around the time of the murders. According to the Homicide Investigation 
Report, Harrigan visited the Tate house the day before the murders (Aug. 7) to discuss “a delivery 
of MDA in the near future” with Frykowski (First Homicide Investigation Progress Report, 11); 
Harrigan’s attorney, when he was a suspect in the Tate murders and questioned by police, was Paul 


Caruso, who would later represent Susan Atkins with his law partner, Richard Caballero. Caruso 


told me that Harrigan sold drugs to Frykowski but was never paid for them. 

40 pallbearer at the gangster Mickey Cohen’s funeral: Author interview with Jim Dickson. 

41 “controlling” him with voodoo: United Press International, “Corrine Calvet Denies Threatening 
with Hex,” Dec. 12, 1967. 

42 “The only thing that I can tell you”: Author interview with Corrine Calvet. As for Calvet’s 
assertion that the FBI told her she was in danger, even though the FBI wasn’t supposed to have 
been involved in the investigation, several dozen people told me they were certain they were 
interviewed by investigators who identified themselves as FBI agents. Roger “Frenchie” 
LaJeunesse, an FBI field agent in Los Angeles, confirmed to me that he participated in the 
investigation in an “unofficial” capacity.

army-issued firearm. Knecht said one of Tacot’s assignments from the CIA included a failed

and Elliot meeting, but it has also been reported by Hoskyns, Waiting for the Sun, 183; and Fiegel, 
Dream a Little Dream, 305. Michael Caine, in his memoir, What’s It All About? (New York: 
Random House, 1992), 318, claimed to have met Manson at a party at Elliot’s house that was also 
attended by Sharon Tate and Jay Sebring.

69 “He was a bad businessman”: Sebring’s nephew, Anthony DiMaria, who is making a documentary 
film about his uncle, adamantly refutes the notion that his uncle was anything but flush at the time 
of his death, but I found ample evidence in police interviews and elsewhere suggesting the opposite 
was true. A few samples: In Restless Souls: The Sharon Tate Family’s Account of Stardom, the 
Manson Murders, and a Crusade for Justice (New York: It Books/HarperCollins, 2012), Alisa 
Statman and Brie Tate say that Sebring was “over a quarter million dollars in debt” (p. 85). Art 
Blum, a business partner, told me that Sebring “always had financial problems, spent it as fast as 
he could... [and] was losing his shirt at the salon.”

date (and location), and divorced him again in June 1967. 

4 during his “rampages”: Case 711515, Superior Court of Los Angeles, Los Angeles.

May 1969. 

10 “Cease to Exist”: Ed Sanders, The Family, 3rd ed. (New York: Thunder’s Mouth, 2002), 64. The 
key word “exist” was changed to “resist” and the song title was changed to “Never Learn Not to 
Love.” It was released as the B side of the first single from the Beach Boys album 20/20 on 
December 8, 1968. The band performed the song, with Dennis singing the lead vocal, on The Mike 


Douglas Show on August 22, 1969, less than two weeks after the Tate-LaBianca murders (see 
IMDB.com, The Mike Douglas Show, episode 8.240). Bugliosi didn’t report that Wilson had stolen 
a song from Manson until the twenty-fifth anniversary edition of Helter Skelter—and then, only in 
a footnote (Vincent Bugliosi with Curt Gentry, Helter Skelter [New York: Norton, 1994], 667).

16 upward of $100,000: Bugliosi and Gentry, Helter Skelter, 335-36. 

17 Wilson gave three interviews: Griffiths, “I Live with 17 Girls”; Altman, “Dennis Wilson”; Lon 
Goddard, “The Continuing Story of Beach Boy Dennis and His House of Seventeen Women,” 
Record Mirror, July 5, 1969. Bugliosi omitted from Helter Skelter the fact that these three 
interviews were published before the murders.

Susan Atkins, aka Sadie Mae Glutz; Linda Kasabian, Patricia Krenwinkel, and Leslie Sankston, 
Dec. 5, 1969, 127. 

27 Wilson and Jakobson knew that Manson had shot: I located more than a half dozen documents in 
the Los Angeles District Attorney files and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office files 
indicating that Manson had discussed the Bernard Crowe shooting with Wilson within a week of 


the Tate murders, although it’s unclear if the name Crowe was ever mentioned. 


28 “upward of a hundred times”: Jakobson testimony, California v. Charles Watson, 2 Crim 22241, 
2851. 

29 “scatter [their] limbs”: Ibid., 2836. 

30 Tate was hanged from the ceiling: Coroner Thomas Noguchi testified, “Based on the wound 
findings on the left side of her cheek and the way the rope was tied at the scene... I would form the 
opinion that Miss Tate had been suspended”—see California v. Manson et al., 8907.

interviews with me) that Hinman met Manson through Wilson, Jakobson, and Melcher, something 
else left out of Helter Skelter. 

38 Altobelli moved back into the house: Melcher eventually admitted to me that he’d lived in the 
house with Altobelli after the murders. He’d said the opposite in his mother’s biography: “I hadn’t 
been in the house since the day I moved out,” Melcher wrote of the day in late November 1969 
when he learned of Manson’s involvement in the murders (Melcher, quoted in A. E. Hotchner, 
Doris Day [New York: Bantam, 1976], 242).

49 Like Ed Sanders: Author interview with Ed Sanders. 

50 Carole Wilson, and Carole Jakobson: The wives of Dennis Wilson and Gregg Jakobson were both 
close to Sebring, Tate, and Altobelli, and they were frequent visitors to the Tate house. Both 
women also had harrowing encounters with Manson before and after the murders. 

51 “August 10”: I later learned that Carole Jakobson was the third person interviewed by the LAPD 
(Carole Jakobson, LAPD Interview, #63, by Varney, Aug. 10, 1969). According to Gregg 
Jakobson’s testimony at the Tate—LaBianca trial, he was also present for the interview, although his 
name doesn’t appear in the LAPD summary. Jakobson told the jury the detectives “really did not 
come to speak to me. They spoke to my wife more than me. I was there so they spoke to me, too” 
(Jakobson testimony, California v. Manson et al.). During his closing argument to the jury, Irving 
Kanarek noted the impossible “coincidence” that the man who knew most about Manson, outside 
of the Family, was among the first to be interviewed by police, and somehow never mentioned his 
friend as a possible suspect in the murders (Kanarek, final statement, ibid., 20274). 

52 spoken to police within a week: Carole Wilson’s interview was on August 15, 1969. 

53 “his way of living and how groovy it was”: Altobelli testimony, California v. Manson et al., 14769. 

54 “I think I have seen him at Dennis Wilson’s house”: Melcher testimony, Los Angeles Grand Jury, 
128. 

55 he’d met Manson no more than three times: Multiple references in Melcher testimony, California v. 
Manson et al. 

56 “Manson and Watson attended a party”: Author interview with Stephen Kay. 

57 never once saw Watson inside his house: Melcher’s recollections about Watson changed 
dramatically according to the needs of the prosecution. Before the grand jury, when shown a photo 
of Watson, Melcher testified that he didn’t “know him” (Melcher testimony, Los Angeles Grand 
Jury, 128). When pressed, he said he may have seen him at Dennis Wilson’s house, but wasn’t 
certain (ibid.). He was never asked about Watson at the Tate—LaBianca trial (Watson wasn’t a 
defendant), but when Watson was tried by Bugliosi after the Tate—LaBianca verdicts and the 
prosecution needed to place the Texan inside the Cielo Drive house prior to the Polanskis’ 
residency, Melcher delivered. Asked by Bugliosi if he’d ever seen Watson in his house, Melcher 
replied that he had “approximately six times” (Melcher testimony, California v. Watson, 2207). 
These discrepancies were never reported in Helter Skelter. 

58 Gentry was working on the book: Gentry, Stephen Kay, and more than six other people who were 


present during the trial confirmed this in interviews with me. 


59 “obstructionist tactics”: Bugliosi and Gentry, Helter Skelter, 371. 

60 opprobrium from every corner: Kanarek first gained fame as the attorney for one of two defendants 
who killed a LAPD officer in a case that would later be immortalized as a book and movie called 
The Onion Field. 

61 Manson wanted the worst: Author interview with Burton Katz; Burton Katz, Justice Overruled: 
Unmasking the Criminal Justice System (New York: Grand Central, 1997), 163; author interview 
with Peter Knecht; author interview with Gary Fields. 

62 He objected nine times: Bugliosi and Gentry, Helter Skelter, 417, 424. 

63 The judge jailed him twice for contempt: Ibid., 466. 

64 “the Toscanini of Tedium”: Ibid., 530. 

65 confidentiality prevented him: Several sources told me they believed Kanarek was paid by 
Melcher, accounting for, they said, Kanarek’s highly uncharacteristic decision to forgo cross- 
examining Melcher on the stand. 

66 living out of his car: Author interview with Fields; author interview with Kay. 

67 Over the ten years previous to our meeting: Unless otherwise indicated, all the information about 
Kanarek came from interviews with him and with George Denny, an attorney and longtime friend. 
Kanarek also shared the story of his nervous breakdown and the loss of his law license with a Los 
Angeles Times reporter; see Dana Parsons, “Barred from World He Loved, Just Getting by Is a 
Trial,” Los Angeles Times, Oct. 25, 1998. 

68 they colluded, that is, to protect the convictions: After the judge ruled that Farr had immunity as a 
newsman and didn’t have to testify about who gave him the sealed documents, the state withdrew 


its charges.

2 the ex-con was fresh out of federal prison: The information in this chapter about Dennis 
Moorehouse is from my interviews with him and from his parole file, which I received from the 
State of California after obtaining his consent. Details about the arrest of Manson in Leggett in July 
1967 are from police reports and news articles.

Willis [sic] Manson, July 28, 1967; “Deputies End Leggett Tryst,” Ukiah [Calif.] Daily Journal, 
July 31, 1967, 8. 


4 The legend is that Manson persuaded: Author interview with Dean Moorehouse. 


5 “They convicted me in December of ’68”: Moorehouse’s first trial had ended in a hung jury the 
previous August (see ibid. and “LSD Trial Ends in Hung Jury; New Trial Date Set,” Ukiah Daily 
Journal, Aug. 28, 1968). 

6 for the long drive to Ukiah: Melcher testimony, California v. Charles Watson, 2 Crim 22241, 2208;

interview with Moorehouse. 

7 “he gave me his credit card”: Author interview with Moorehouse. See also Sanders, The Family, 
83; Watson and Ray, Will You Die for Me?, 62. In August 1968, Watson was ticketed for speeding 
while driving Melcher’s car in San Luis Obispo County with Moorehouse. When Watson failed to 
pay the fine or appear for the court date, a warrant was issued for his arrest, identifying Melcher as 
the registered owner of the vehicle (case T-3504, citation F221471, California v. Charles Denton 
Watson, Order to Appear, County of San Luis Obispo Justice Court, Sept. 5, 1968—from the files 
of Los Angeles Sheriff’s Office).

10 my visits weren’t exactly authorized: Since my last visit to the files in 2006, to the best of my 
knowledge all other requests from researchers wanting similar access have been denied. 

11 the Straight Satans: DeCarlo helped found the bike club in 1966, according to testimony from his 
trial for drug smuggling. See United States v. DeCarlo et al., no. 37502-SD-Criminal, U.S. District 
Court, Southern District, March 28—June 30, 1967.

15 His testimony did a lot of heavy lifting for Bugliosi: The prosecutor wrote in Helter Skelter that he 
“succeed[ed] in getting a tremendous amount of evidence in through DeCarlo” (468). 

16 he identified the weapons used in the murders: Ibid., 464-69.

26 Melcher had expressly denied: Melcher testimony, California v. Manson et al., 15124. 

27 “He did not record Manson”: Bugliosi, closing argument, ibid., 21370. When Bugliosi executive- 
produced a remake of the TV movie of Helter Skelter in 2004, he included a scene depicting 
Melcher and Wilson recording Manson in a studio (John Gray, Helter Skelter script, page 9). 

28 Donald “Shorty” Shea: Bugliosi and Gentry, Helter Skelter, 661. 

29 “After one of the girls told me that they killed the caretaker”: Parks probably believed, erroneously, 
that Shea was the “caretaker” of the ranch. 

30 “Melcher was on acid”: Unsigned handwritten notes, Paul Watkins interview, LASO, Dec. 19, 
1969, 7. 

31 “Dennis and Greg had been there”: In police interviews and interviews with me, Jakobson 
described several visits he made with Wilson to the Family’s outpost in Death Valley. This 
suggested that Wilson wasn’t done with the Family after he allegedly threw them out of his home 
in August 1968. The Family didn’t start going to the desert until mid-November 1968, according to 
police reports, trial testimony, and Helter Skelter. 

32 “And they said, probably not”: Melcher was less kind in his mother’s biography, writing: “The 
cops said that five or six of the Manson girls claimed that Manson had set me up with them and 
that I was the father of their babies. I finally got so fed up with the cops over these sex inquiries 
that I got out the pictures of the most recent ladies in my life, real beauties, all of them, and I said, 
‘Listen, when I’ve got beauties like these to get in bed with, why would I want to screw any of 
Manson’s clap-ridden, unwashed dogs?’” (A. E. Hotchner, Doris Day [New York: Bantam, 1976], 
247). 

33 soon rubbing elbows with the sons: All the Jakobson information comes from my interviews with 
him, unless otherwise noted. 

34 racking up a few arrests along the way: According to testimony at Tex Watson’s trial, Jakobson had 
been arrested on a drug charge in November 1968; Watson said that Manson sent him to Melcher’s 


house to get money to bail Jakobson out of jail. Melcher refused, and had his chauffeur drive 


Watson down to Sunset Boulevard so he could hitchhike back to the Spahn Ranch (Watson 
testimony, California v. Watson, 3251, 3310). The second arrest, according to Melcher’s first 
police interview (LAPD Interview, #231, by Patchett, Nov. 31 [sic], 1969), occurred on his and 
Jakobson’s third visit to the Spahn Ranch. LAPD detective Frank Patchett wrote, “It was on that 
visit that the three were stopped by LA County sheriffs and Jakobson was arrested for a ticket. 
Melcher bailed him out.” It seemed curious to me that there was actually a sheriff’s officer at the 
Spahn Ranch who arrested Jakobson during his and Melcher’s “final” visit to Manson in May 
1969. 

35 “He doesn’t anymore”: Jakobson testimony, California v. Manson et al., 14182. 

36 “how much of that is legend and how much of it is true”: Though both Melcher and Jakobson’s 
testimony about the spyglass was brought out by Bugliosi—and the prosecutor also included it in 
his summation—for some reason Bugliosi never mentions this vital bit of information in Helter 
Skelter. Melcher wrote about it in his mother’s biography: Manson had “stolen a telescope from the 
deck of the Malibu house, presumably to let me know he knew my whereabouts” (Hotchner, Doris 
Day, 249). 

37 “Jakobson frequently smiled at Manson”: Associated Press, “Defendant in Tate Trial Well Liked,” 
Nov. 16, 1970. 

38 “thank Mr. Melcher for his presence”: California v. Manson et al., 15152. Although Bugliosi 
omitted the cordial remarks from Kanarek to Melcher in Helter Skelter, he did note (without 
editorial comment) that Kanarek chose not to examine Melcher, “probably at Manson’s request”

Simon and Schuster, 2013), 157, 182, 198. 

AO “all and any references”: I counted five changes between the original hardcover edition (1996) and 
the paperback reissue (1999). References to Melcher’s involvement with the Manson women were 
removed and the number of times he visited the Spahn Ranch was changed from “several” to 
“twice.” Any suggestions that he was aware of Manson’s propensity for murder were excised 
entirely. All the changes to Waiting for the Sun can be seen by comparing the following pages (the 
1996 hardcover versus the 1999 paperback): 176/181, 176/181 (a second set of changes here), 
179/183, 179/184, 179/184 (a second set of changes here), and 181/186. 


5. Amnesia at the L.A. County Sheriff’s Office 


1 A soft-spoken Buddhist: All the information about Hinman in this chapter comes from the Hinman 
murder trial transcripts (A-057452, The People of the State of California v. Robert Kenneth 


Beausoleil) or Helter Skelter, unless otherwise noted. 


2 Atkins and Brunner took turns: Atkins and Brunner both admitted smothering Hinman with a 
pillow. But at Atkins’s 1978 parole hearing, she said it was Beausoleil who smothered Hinman 
(Atkins testimony, Subsequent Parole Consideration Hearing, State of California Board of Prison 
Terms, in the Matter of the Life Term Parole Consideration Hearing of Susan Atkins, CDC Inmate 
W-08340, July 20, 1978, 24-25). 

3 They spent five days: Paul Whiteley testimony, California v. Robert Beausoleil (I), A-057452, 9; 
Ed Sanders, The Family, 3rd ed. (New York: Thunder’s Mouth, 2002), 188. 

4 a woman had been in his house: Bill Gleason (retired LASO), timeline of Hinman murder (provided 
by Gleason to author); author interview with Jay Hofstadter; Hofstadter testimony, California v. 
Charles Manson (for Hinman and Shea murders), A-267861, 4124; Richard Siegel testimony, ibid., 
4345. Gleason’s timeline contains these entries: 

7-26-69 and 7-27-69: Jay Hofstadter calls Hinman home, phone answered by Atkins; second call 
by Mary Brunner. 
7-26-69 and 7-27-69: Richard Siegal calls Hinman, Atkins answers, speaks with English accent. 

5 he had at least one accomplice: Gleason timeline; the applicable entry reads: 7-26-69: Dave Ewing 
knocks on front door of Gary Hinman’s home, Susan Atkins answers door carrying candle, said 
Hinman in Colorado. (He was being tortured at the time.) 

In addition, according to documents in the LASO files, Ewing was a biker known as 
“preacher” who lived with Hinman in 1968 and knew the Family well. Ewing could have provided 
a physical identification of Atkins at the Hinman house during the period he was being tortured 
and murdered, but for reasons unknown he never testified in any of the Hinman murder trials. He 
refused to be interviewed for this book. 

6 that led them to overlook Manson: Vincent Bugliosi with Curt Gentry, Helter Skelter (New York: 
Norton, 1994), 113. 

7 the two detectives did the right thing: Ibid., 62. 

8 kept the Manson Family at large: Ibid. 

9 arrest was for stolen vehicles: They were also charged with possession of stolen property, 
possession of illegal firearms (a sawed-off shotgun), and arson (they’d set fire to a federally owned 
earth-moving vehicle, a “Michigan Loader”). See “28 ‘Hips’ Nabbed in Death Valley, Goler Wash 
Raids,” Inyo [Calif.] Independent, Oct. 16, 1969, 1. 

10 On August 16, 1969: Unless otherwise noted, all the information on the Spahn Ranch Raid is from 
the reports I obtained from the LASO files and from interviews with officers who participated in 
the raid, some of whom shared additional records from the raid, including its “operational plan.” 

11 “It was the most flawlessly”: Author interview with John Kolman. 

12 perhaps even sending undercover agents to investigate: Frank Salerno, a retired LASO narcotics 


detective, told me that LASO intelligence sent undercover agents wired with recording devices into 


the Spahn Ranch to purchase narcotics from Family members but were unsuccessful. Another 
retired detective, Gil Parra, who worked LASO intelligence and homicide, told me that when he 
started working intelligence in May 1969, the sheriffs already had “informants” planted at the 
ranch. 

13 “on a misdated warrant”: Bugliosi and Gentry, Helter Skelter, 90. 

14 Ellroy still hailed him: James Ellroy, My Dark Places (New York: Knopf, 1996), 217; the author 
also praised Guenther as the cop “who really broke the Charles Manson case” (ibid.). 

15 “Same knife. Same wound”: In a phone conversation, Noguchi told me he “thinks” he remembers 
telling Guenther this but isn’t certain. He also said he was “surprised” when the LAPD announced 
two days after the LaBianca killings that the couple’s murders were committed by different 
perpetrators than the ones who killed the Tate victims. 

16 Bugliosi had discredited it: Bugliosi, in his words, “demolished” the false scenario by exposing its 
many holes. Among those he listed: If Tate and LaBianca were to be a “carbon copy” of Hinman, 
why weren’t the words “Political Piggy” written at the Tate house, rather than just “Pig,” and why 
were there no paw prints like the ones left at Hinman’s? How did the words “Helter Skelter” on the 
LaBiancas’ refrigerator mimic the Tate or Hinman murder scene? (Bugliosi and Gentry, Helter 
Skelter, 586-87; author interview with Vincent Bugliosi). 

17 No one in law enforcement: More than two dozen investigators, from both LASO and the LAPD, 
didn’t believe the Helter Skelter motive. Many of Bugliosi’s own colleagues at the DA’s office 
didn’t, either. Among those who said this on the record were: Aaron Stovitz, Bugliosi’s original 
coprosecutor, who told me he never believed the murders were committed for any other reason 
than to free Bobby Beausoleil; Burton Katz, who prosecuted two Family members (Beausoleil in 
his retrial for Hinman, and Grogan for the Shea murder), was certain it was a copycat, too, saying 
Bugliosi used Helter Skelter because he wanted “something sexy”; and Jeff Jonas, who appeared 
for the state against Beausoleil and Bruce Davis at parole hearings. 

18 allegedly Linda Kasabian: In my interview with him, Beausoleil denied making any such phone 
call; Kasabian, through her family, turned down repeated requests for an interview. 

19 “Pig” in blood: Atkins Testimony, Grand Jury, A253156, The People of the State of California v. 
Charles Manson, Charles Watson, aka Charles Montgomery; Susan Atkins, aka Sadie Mae Glutz; 
Linda Kasabian, Patricia Krenwinkel, and Leslie Sankston, Dec. 5, 1969. 

20 on the wall at Hinman’s: Both Atkins and Beausoleil have taken credit for writing “Political Piggy” 
in Hinman’s blood at his house. It’s difficult to know which one actually did it (author interview 
with Bobby Beausoleil; Atkins testimony, Grand Jury, 69). 

21 other journalists had sniffed around: Both Guenther and his partner Whiteley worked closely with 
Ed Sanders on his book The Family (their names appear in the acknowledgments). However, when 


I asked Sanders whether they’d ever told him about the tape and, if so, why he hadn’t written about 


it, Sanders said he’d heard only about the phone call, not that there had been a recording of it. 

22 made sure that someone else did: It’s difficult to determine whether it was illegal in 1969 to tape an 
inmate’s call in the Los Angeles County jail without his or her knowledge. Some experts told me it 
was legal as long as the inmates were informed of the possibility, either verbally or by posted 
notice. Others told me calls could be recorded only by court order.

Milles Manson, Aug. 16, 1969. 

52 a warrant is good for ten days: Section 1534(a) of the California Penal Code reads: “A search 
warrant shall be executed and returned within 10 days after date of issuance.” 

53 because of insufficient evidence: Sanders, The Family, 268. 

54 never caught attempting to use the cards: According to Manson’s arrest report (P. R. George, 
Supplementary Report), the four cards—each for a different gasoline company—belonged to Irvin 
H. Weiland, M.D., of Encino, whom I located and spoke to. Dr. Weiland told me the cards had 
been in his wallet, which was stolen from the glove compartment of his car. He didn’t remember 
whether they had ever been used, but, as several retired LASO officials told me, the possession of 
stolen goods itself is a crime. 

55 On a bedside table were several joints: Unless otherwise noted, the information about this arrest is 
from the Manson and Schram arrest reports (R. Wachsmuth, Complaint Report, Charles Milles 
Manson, Carol Matthews [Schram], File 469-02723-1071-181, Aug. 24, 1969); a transcript of a 
sheriff’s interview with Schram and her parents (“Statement of Stephanie Schram,” and parents, 
File 069-02378-1076-036, by Dep. George A. Palmer and Sgt. William Gleason, LASO, Dec. 4,

58 No reason was given for the decision: Statement of Stephanie Schram, 29. In the statement, 


Schram’s mother rebukes Gleason and Palmer, saying that her daughter is now on probation for 


“possession of marijuana... and it’s on her record, but he [Manson] was just set free!” Mrs. Schram 
adds, “He was violating federal parole [and] they let him loose!” 

59 found with drugs and a juvenile: Manson, Supplementary Report. 

60 never even bothered going to arrest him: This is my assumption based on the fact that I was unable 
to find any documentary evidence indicating that it had been done.

Family members, trial testimonies, and witness reports.

6. Who Was Reeve Whitson? 


1 before the Polanskis’ maid had arrived: Police estimated she arrived at the front gate at 
approximately 8:30 a.m. (LAPD First Homicide Investigation Progress Report, DR 69-059-593, 
15). 

2 It appeared four times: Hatami testimony, California v. Charles Manson, Susan Atkins, Leslie Van 
Houten and Patricia Krenwinkel, case #22239, 14483, 14508, 14542, 14554. 

3 “Just Reeve Whitson, myself, and Mr. Hatami”: California v. Manson et al., 14554. 

4 The judge decided that Hatami: Judge Older refused to allow Hatami to make a physical 
identification of Manson in court because of his uncertainty over who he saw that day. He 
permitted him only to testify that the person resembled the defendant (ibid., 14566—67). 


5 “about eight lives simultaneously”: Author interview with William Whitson (who is unrelated to 


Reeve Whitson). 

6 The coroner described blood smears: First Homicide Investigation Progress Report (4—5) reads: 
“There was dried blood smeared over the entire body. It appeared to investigating officers that 
someone had handled the victim, as in moving her from one location to another and the blood from 
the wounds had been smeared over the body in the process.” 

7 heard gunshots and arguing: First Homicide Investigation Progress Report, 19-21. Bugliosi 
described two incidents of sounds heard after the killers were supposed to have left the property in 
his book but omitted two more reports of shouting and gunfire that occurred hours after the 
murders—one from a second private security officer on patrol in the vicinity; see Vincent Bugliosi 
with Curt Gentry, Helter Skelter (New York: Norton, 1994), 20-21. 

8 “see what my children did”: Ed Sanders, The Family, 3rd ed. (New York: Thunder’s Mouth, 2002),

Bugliosi, in author’s possession. 

10 a traveling family act: Author interview with Hope Hirschman. 

11 “His great strength”: Author interview with William Whitson. 

12 According to a few people I spoke with: Author interview with the Edlunds; author interview with 
Rosenfelt; author interview with Julie Newmar. 

13 how many powerful friends he had: Among other Whitson friends I spoke to were Leon Uris 
(author of Exodus), John Raitt (actor-singer), and Art Linkletter (the television entertainer, who 
told me Whitson was “a spook”).

28 Cielo house was under surveillance: Author interview with Sanders; author interview with Hanson. 

29 her daughter wasn’t supposed: Ibid. Hanson, a private investigator and close friend of Doris and 
Paul Tate, also told me that Doris “confirmed” to her that a call had been made from the Spahn 
Ranch to Cielo Drive a few hours before the murders. In Helter Skelter, however, Bugliosi 
maintained that records for the Spahn Ranch pay phone from April to October 1969 didn’t show 
any calls to the Tate house (the months of April and July were “lost or destroyed,” he added). See 
Bugliosi and Gentry, Helter Skelter, 333.

The high-security facility, which had a contract with the Defense Department, was located in 
Chatsworth, California, less than five miles from the Spahn Ranch. The company’s founder and 
president, Mihai Patrichi, was a former Romanian army general who was a member of the Iron 
Guard, a far-right political group in Romania (“General Radescu’s Relations with the Iron

7. Neutralizing the Left 


In June 2002, the San Francisco Chronicle published an award-winning series of investigative articles 
about the rise of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley and the attendant crackdown by Governor 
Ronald Reagan, the CIA, and the FBI. Using information from files won in three Freedom of 
Information lawsuits against the FBI, the reporter Seth Rosenfeld’s six-story series exposed the 
previously unreported lengths that Reagan, the FBI Director [[J Edgar Hoover]], and the CIA Director 
John McCone went to in order to dismantle and smear the leaders of the left-wing movement in 


California. Much of the information in this chapter is from Rosenfeld’s series, later expanded into a 


book, The FBI’s War on Student Radicals, and Reagan’s Rise to Power (New York: Farrar Straus 
Giroux, 2012). I also relied heavily on the published reports of the Rockefeller Commission and 
Church Committee (The President’s Commission on CIA Activities Within the United States 
(Washington, D.C.: GPO, 1975]; hereinafter, the Rockefeller Commission); and The United States 
Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities 
(Washington, D.C.: GPO, 1976]; hereinafter, the Church Committee), as well as the reporting of 
Seymour Hersh in the New York Times and Ward Churchill and Jim Vander Wall’s indispensable The 
COINTELPRO Papers: Documents from the FBI’s Secret Wars Against Domestic Dissent (Boston: 
South End Press, 1990).

D.C., office of the FBI (FOIPA no. 0966502); a second request to the Los Angeles Field Office 
produced an additional thirty-eight pages (FOIPA no. 190-231795). Many of the redactions are 
preceded or followed by phrases like “project which was very sensitive in nature” or “Top Secret 
(The D.O.D. [Department of Defense] Clearances are still active).” One report revealed that 
Herrmann’s work for the White House Office of Science and Technology (at unspecified dates in 
the 1960s) was “so sensitive in nature” that the White House “was unable to provide any further 
information”—and the information that was provided to the FBI was then redacted by the agency. 
Other records revealed that Herrmann received his first “secret clearance” from the federal 
government on February 7, 1957. That was elevated to a “top secret security clearance” on April 
16, 1965, by the Office of Security, Treasury Department (FOIPA no. 0966502).

CIA, who sometimes operated under cover as an employee of the Agency for International 
Development (AID).” 

72 he was a part of AID: CORDS Historical Working Group Files. In addition, Herrmann told two

1978 examined the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., and Robert F. 
Kennedy), reported that the committee discovered a CIA operative had also infiltrated New 
Orleans DA Jim Garrison’s 1966 investigation and prosecution of Clay Shay, an alleged CIA 
operative, for the John F. Kennedy assassination. In her Farewell to Justice: Jim Garrison, JFK’s 
Assassination, and the Case That Should Have Changed History (Dulles, Va.: Potomac Books, 
2007), Joan Mellen alleges that two Garrison investigators, William Martin and William C. Wood, 
were secretly contracted by the CIA to “sabotage” his prosecution.

8. The Lawyer Swap 


1 ordered all three sets of slaughters: Stephen Kay, who joined the prosecution after the trial began, 
said as far as he knew there was never any thought to try the cases together, but he would’ve done 
it. “When you’re trying a conspiracy, you want as many cases as possible,” he explained. Hinman’s 
murder was also further “proof” of the Helter Skelter motive, Kay added; Manson wanted 
Hinman’s money to get the Family to the desert during “the race war.” 

2 a closed meeting with the judge: Bugliosi omits this episode from his book, mentioning only that 
the first Beausoleil trial ended in a hung jury because DeCarlo, “brought in at the last minute... 
hadn’t been a convincing witness” (Vincent Bugliosi with Curt Gentry, Helter Skelter [New York: 
Norton, 1994], 206-7). My account of the Beausoleil prosecution relies on interviews with Leon 
Salter and Ron Ross, the opposing attorneys, the trial transcript, and Jerry LeBlanc and Ivor 
Davis’s 5 to Die, which has the best rendering of the first Beausoleil trial (Los Angeles: Holloway 
House, 1970). 

3 already a convicted felon: United States v. DeCarlo et al., no. 37502-SD-Criminal, U.S. District

8 “warm and sticky and nice”: Ibid., 126. 

9 On the evening of November 19: The information in this passage comes from ibid., 172—73. 

10 Atkins’s attorney was Gerald Condon: The account that follows is based on documents discovered 
in the files of the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Office; the Los Angeles Superior Court Archives; the Los 
Angeles District Attorney’s office; the personal files of Paul LePage, the LAPD detective who 
supervised the LaBianca murder investigation (shared by his son, Paul LePage Jr.); the files of 
Mike McGann, the LAPD detective who worked the Tate investigation; as well as from interviews 
with Gerald Condon, F. Milton Condon (his brother, who assisted Gerald), and others, as noted. 

11 Beausoleil... was already represented: This public defender was Leon Salter. 

12 Condon was appointed on November 12: Susan Atkins, County of Los Angeles Sheriff’s 
Department, Supplementary Report, Nov. 12, 1969. 

13 seven-page memo: “Hinman, Tate, et. [sic] al., LaBianca murder cases,” LASO Files. This

me this. 

18 worked there himself for eight years: Dial Torgerson and Ron Einstoss, “Jury Hears Tate Case Girl 
Today, Los Angeles Times, Dec. 5, 1969. 

19 close with his former colleagues: California v. Charles Manson, Susan Atkins, Leslie Van Houten 
and Patricia Krenwinkel, case 22239, 25063. Caballero acknowledged that—like his law partner 
who assisted him in the case, Paul Caruso—he was a member of the “EJY Club,” a steering 
committee of citizens dedicated to electing DA Evelle J. Younger as attorney general of California 
in 1970. The club was disbanded after Younger’s opponent charged that its members received 
favors from Younger in exchange for donations.

[Calif.] Evening Outlook, Dec. 1, 1969, 1. 

21 well-known mob lawyer: Jeanie Kasindorf, “The Case Against Evelle Younger,” New West 
Magazine, Oct. 23, 1978. This eight-page cover story alleged that DA Younger protected organized 
crime figures through the help of friends like Caruso. The story focused on a notorious 1967 case 
involving Caruso’s representation of Maurice Friedman, a mobster, who, with Johnny Rosselli— 
Charles Baron’s associate—was tried for fixing card games at the Hollywood Friars Club. 

22 she’d been “at the scene”: All the quotes in this paragraph from an unbylined front-page story, “8

Today.” 

29 Bugliosi described it as “excellent”: Bugliosi and Gentry, Helter Skelter, 232. 


30 nothing was ever formalized or signed: When pressed by Kanarek about not having a signed 
agreement, Caballero said, the “common practice is such that these agreements aren’t written 
down. It is just normally not done. These people are lawyers, professional people. You make an 
agreement and you keep it” (Caballero testimony, California v. Manson et al., 25803). Kanarek 
made sure to point out that Linda Kasabian’s attorneys had received a fully executed contract for 
her deal with the prosecution.

37 But after the grand jury, the deal changed: In Helter Skelter, Bugliosi wrote that once he learned 
Atkins wouldn’t testify against the others the deal was all but over, despite their promise to Atkins 
about not having to testify at trial (ibid., 338). 

38 “we still didn’t have a case”: Ibid., 285, 295. 

39 who came bearing messages from Manson: Ibid., 295, 338. 

40 in negotiations with the attorney of Linda Kasabian: In Helter Skelter, Bugliosi made it appear that 
they didn’t begin negotiations with Kasabian’s attorney until after they’d been notified on February 
26, 1970, that Atkins wouldn’t testify at trial (which, again, she didn’t have to do anyway). But 
according to documents I found, they’d already started discussing a Kasabian deal on or before 
January 22. One such document from the LePage files, dated January 22, 1970 and titled “Minutes 
of Meeting at Robbery Homicide, LAPD,” contained the following: “Present [at meeting], LePage 
[eight other LAPD detectives], Stovitz and Bugliosi... On Kasabian, for us to agree to a plea of 
manslaughter she would have to give full testimony in each trial. Her attorneys strike me (Stovitz)

55 landed on his doorstep: Bugliosi and Gentry, Helter Skelter, 260-62. 

56 Helter Skelter left all of this out: All the information—including direct quotes—in this section is 
taken from the transcripts of the death-penalty phase testimony of Susan Atkins, Richard Caballero, 
Paul Caruso, Carmella Ambrosini, Lawrence Schiller, Vincent Bugliosi, and Aaron Stovitz, unless 
otherwise indicated. Ed Sanders also wrote a series of articles in the Los Angeles Free Press in 
1970 (under his own name and various pseudonyms) detailing his suspicion that Caballero and 
Caruso had been planted by the prosecution and sabotaged the Family’s defense: “Manson Can Go 
Free: Distinguished Attorney Maps Out Manson’s Defense,” Jan. 16, 1970, 1, 6, 7; Dunbar J. Van

Specializes in the Sensational,” New York Times, Jan. 20, 1977; author interview with Richard 
Shackleton. 

58 “until her fate is decided”: Schiller, The Killing of Sharon Tate, 66. 

59 $40,000 for exclusive English rights: Bugliosi and Gentry, Helter Skelter, 262. The New York 
Times reported Schiller’s gross at $175,000—see Lichtenstein, “Gilmore’s Agent an Entrepreneur.” 

60 collaborating with Cohen on a book of his own: Author interview with Vincent Bugliosi. 

61 said reporter worked for the same newspaper: Schiller testified that Cohen had taken a three-day 
leave of absence from the Times to write the story (Schiller testimony, California v. Manson et al., 
24911). 


62 afterward he claimed in interviews: See David Margolick, “Letter from Los Angeles: O.J.’s Ghost,” 


Vanity Fair, Nov. 1996, 116; David Scheff, “Playboy Interview: Lawrence Schiller,” Playboy, Feb. 
1997, 23; Lichtenstein, “Gilmore’s Agent an Entrepreneur”; Norman Mailer, The Executioner’s 
Song (New York: Warner, 1980), 599. 

63 if not for Pete Miller: All the information in this section is taken from the transcripts of the death- 
penalty phase testimony of Pete Miller, Caballero, and Bugliosi, unless otherwise indicated. 

64 “the prosecution didn’t put up any obstacles”: “Checkbook Journalism.” 

65 wanted the publicity from the case: Ed Sanders, “‘Gas Chamber’ Prosecution Girds Its Loins for 
Battle,” Los Angeles Free Press, June 12, 1970, 12. 

66 Lawrence Schiller wouldn’t talk: His assistant in 2005, Kathleen, told me the Manson case was 
“the one subject he doesn’t discuss” (of course, from his interviews with Playboy, Vanity Fair, and 
more, that hardly appears to be true). 

67 supporting the official explanation: Richard Warren Lewis, The Scavengers and Critics of the 
Warren Report: Based on an Investigation by Lawrence Schiller (New York: Delacorte Press, 
1967). 

68 Ruby’s confessing to the murder: Released by Capitol Records in 1967 as an LP, it’s titled The 
Controversy. 

69 hadn’t killed Oswald: According to documents I found at the National Archives, Schiller sent a 
prerelease transcript of the Ruby interview to, among others, [[J Edgar Hoover]], offering it as proof 
that Ruby shot Oswald “on an impulse and there was no conspiracy” (House Select Committee on 
Assassinations, Rec. 180-10019-10176, File 62-109060-4429, Jan. 20, 1967, 2). In an effort to 
refute Warren Commission critic Mark Lane, who claimed that a famous photograph of Kennedy’s 
alleged assassin Oswald holding the rifle used in the crime was doctored, Schiller appeared in a 
1967 TV documentary to present the findings of his “independent study” of the picture, showing it 
was authentic (The Warren Report, CBS, June 25, 1967). A decade later, in Carl Bernstein’s 
groundbreaking exposé, “The CIA and the Media” (Rolling Stone, Oct. 20, 1977), Bernstein 
reported that “CBS was unquestionably the CIA’s most valuable asset,” adding, “over the years the 
network provided cover for CIA employees, including at least one well-known foreign 
correspondent and several stringers” (61). 

70 Their identities were never revealed: Bernstein, “The CIA and the Media,” 55—67. 

71 believed Schiller was one of those assets: Author interview with Mark Lane. 

72 “smear” him in the press: HSCA, Rec. 180-10019-100034, File 008976, June 6, 1978. 

73 Schiller had been acting as an informant: Most of the information in this section is taken from the 
records of the National Archive’s Kennedy Assassination Collection. However, I also relied 
heavily on a book by Joan Mellen, a Temple University professor, about New Orleans District 
Attorney Jim Garrison’s unsuccessful prosecution of alleged CIA “asset” Clay Shaw, for the 


murder of President Kennedy. A Farewell to Justice: Jim Garrison, JFK’s Assassination, and The 


Case That Should Have Changed History (Dulles, Va.: Potomac Books, 2005) used many of the 
same documents I found to make a compelling case that Schiller and Cohen were among many 
CIA and FBI media assets tasked to obstruct and derail the controversial DA’s investigation. 

74 publications that provided CIA employees with cover: Bernstein, “The CIA and the Media,” 63. 
Bernstein reported that Henry Luce, the founding publisher of Time and Life magazines, “readily 
allowed certain members of his staff—at Time and Life—to work for the Agency and agreed to 
provide jobs and credentials to other CIA operatives who lacked journalistic experience” (ibid.). 

75 and then sharing his findings with the FBI: HSCA, Rec. 180-10046-10153, File 105-82555- 
unrecorded, Mar. 16, 1967, 1—6; FBI, Rec. 124-100048-10455, File 62-109060-4876, Mar. 15. 
1967, 1; FBI, Rec. 124-10050-10025, File 62-109060-4907, Mar. 22, 1967, 1—4; FBI, Rec. 124- 
10050-10018, File 62-109060-4903, Mar. 29, 1967, 1—4. 

76 “in possession of the names”: FBI, Rec. 124-100048-10455, File 62-109060-4876, Mar. 15. 1967, 
1. A week later, according to two follow-up memos, Schiller met with agent A. Rosen of the FBI’s 
Los Angeles Field Office and provided the name, aliases, and likely addresses of Lane’s informant 
—see FBI, Rec. 124-10050-10025, File 62-109060-4907, Mar. 22, 1967, 1—4; FBI, Rec. 124- 
10050-10018, File 62-109060-4903, Mar. 29, 1967, 1—4. 

77 According to memos, the FBI eagerly awaited: FBI, Rec. 124-10050-10006, File 62-109060-4897, 
Mar. 28, 1967, 1. In addition, Schiller informed the FBI of articles “under consideration” at Life 
that “attacked the conclusions of the Warren Commission” (FBI, Rec. 124-10043-10283, File 62- 
109060-4846, Mar. 21, 1967) and of articles in preparation at other publications—in this case The 
New Yorker—with information about Garrison’s investigation that hadn’t been made public yet 
(FBI, Rec. 124-10050-10006, File 62-109060-4897, Mar. 28, 1967, 3). 

78 President Kennedy and his brother Robert: Noyes’s book, Legacy of Doubt (New York: Pinnacle, 
1973), blamed right-wing intelligence operatives and organized crime for the assassinations of both 
Kennedys. 

79 pressured him to abandon the project: Author interview with Pete Noyes. 

80 Noyes was fairly certain that Cohen: The CIA never responded to my 2002 FOIA for information 
on Cohen. His widow, Dorothy, a former journalist and two-term mayor of South Pasadena, 
declined my request for an interview. His daughter, Cassy, also a journalist, spoke to me briefly but 
said she couldn’t continue without consulting an attorney. 

81 interview with Howard: “Interview of Rena Howard—Sybil Brand Institute,” Nov. 18, 1969, 1—4, 
LePage personal files. 

82 drugs on the nights of the murders: Kasabian testified more than a dozen times that she didn’t take 
drugs anytime around the murders. “I just know,” she said under cross-examination by Kanarek 
(California v. Manson et al., 6302). “Do I have to give a further explanation? I just know.” 


83 all the killers had taken speed: Kasabian voice-over, Manson, Cineplex Productions, 2009: “Before 


we left the ranch, I remember that we all took some speed. A white capsule was handed to me and I 
took it.” 

84 repeated incessantly in Atkins’s later accounts: In the Dec. 14, 1969, Los Angeles Times story, 
Schiller quoted Atkins saying Manson “instructed” her to do things five times in just the opening 
column of the multipage article. 

85 They may not even have known: Keith Ditman testimony, California v. Manson et al., 25347. 

86 he had no explanation for why: By the end of Manson’s life, this had evolved to his saying he 
might’ve had an idea what they were going to do, but he had nothing to do with it. “I didn’t direct 
anyone to do a motherfucking thing,” Manson told Rolling Stone in 2013 (Erik Hedegaard, 
“Charles Manson Today: The Final Confessions of a Psychopath,” Rolling Stone, Nov. 21, 2013).

Report, DR 69-059-593, 16. 

88 “a misleading clue for the police”: Nuel Emmons, Manson in His Own Words (New York: Grove 
Press, 1986), 207. 

89 Manson himself vaguely disavowed: Author interview with Craig Hammond. 

90 several televised interviews to promote it: Manson, with Emmons, was interviewed in prison by 
Tom Snyder for Snyder’s eponymous show on June 12, 1981, and again, for Today on Jan. 27, 
1987. 

91 “So what if I did make you”: Charles Manson to Linda Kasabian, Mar. 21, 1970, LASO files. 

92 she told Atkins to stop cooperating: Bugliosi and Gentry, Helter Skelter, 294. 

93 never given an interview about Manson: Author interview with Danny Bowser. 

94 covert surveillance on known criminals: All the information about SIS in this section is from a 
series of investigative pieces the Los Angeles Times ran about the secretive unit, beginning with 
David Freed, “Special Investigations Section: Watching Crime Happen—LAPD’s Secret SIS Unit, 
Citizens Terrorized as Police Look On,” Sept. 25, 1988; and including Matt Lait, “SIS: Stormy 
Past, Shaky Future; LAPD’s Special Investigation Section,” Los Angeles Times, Nov. 29, 1998. 

95 “We weren’t even connected”: Ibid. 

96 SIS was called the “Death Squad”: Lait, “SIS: Stormy Past.” 

97 “documented numerous instances”: Freed, “Special Investigations Section.” 

98 “Even within the LAPD”: Lait, “SIS: Stormy Past.”

9. Manson’s Get-Out-of-Jail-Free Card 


1 The events of June 4, 1969: All information about the June 4, 1969, arrest is from the two-page 
police report (Officer G. M. Heidrich, LAPD, Arrest Report, DR 69-469997). 

2 The police had discovered a warrant: The information about the arrests and prosecution of Atkins, 
Brunner, and other female Family members in Mendocino, as well as the probation violations of 
Atkins after her sentence, and Mendocino County’s effort to revoke her probation, comes from 
arrest reports, court minutes, probation reports, news clippings, and interviews with principal 
subjects. Sources are cited below whenever a document, news report, or interview is quoted. If 
information is presented without quotation marks, it comes from the more than two dozen 
documents, clips, and interviews compiled for this section. The same goes for the almost identical 
events in Oregon a year earlier. 

3 “no intentions of abiding by it”: “Probation Officer’s Report and Recommendation for Revocation 
in Absentia,” Sadie Mae Glutz, Case no. 4503-C, Dept. 2, Filed in the Superior Court of the State 
of California, Mendocino County, Statement of Fact, Margo S. Tompkins, May 29, 1969, 3. 

4 “the defendant has not violated”: “Minute Order on Probation Hearing,” Glutz, Case no. 4503-C, 
Dept. 2, Filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, Mendocino County, June 18, 1969,

5 murders of at least eight people: Atkins was convicted in the seven Tate—LaBianca killings and 
pleaded guilty to the murder of Gary Hinman. 

6 a “traveling minister’: Mary Yates, Senior Probation Officer, City and County of San Francisco, 
letter to C. H. McFarlan, Deputy Administrator, Interstate Probation and Parole, Sacramento, Re: 
Susan Denise Atkins, Case CJ 4771-Oregon, Nov. 10, 1967, 1-2. 

7 “is in love with all of them”: Ibid., 1. 

8 “certain she will do as she pleases”: Ibid., 2. 

9 “Her speech was quite disorganized”: M. E. Madison, Memo to File, Re: Atkins, CJ Prob. 4771, 
Nov. 14, 1967. 

10 they wrote to the original sentencing judge: M. E. Madison, Supervisor, Interstate Unit, letter to 
Honorable Judge George A. Jones, Marion County Court House, Re: Atkins, CJ Prob. 4771, Dec. 
12, 1967, 1-2. 

11 terminating Susan Atkins’s probation: George A. Jones, Circuit Judge, State of Oregon, County of 
Marion, no. 61487, Oregon v. Atkins, “Order Terminating Probation,” Jan. 4, 1968. 

12 Manson sent his girls there: The information in this section is from the same records, clippings, and 
interviews, with additional arrest, court, and probation files of the others arrested in Mendocino on 
May 22, 1968: Mary Brunner, Ella Jo Bailey, Patricia Krenwinkel, and Stephanie Rowe. 


Additional information comes from such books as David E. Smith and John Luce, Love Needs 


Care (Boston: Little, Brown, 1971), Ed Sanders, The Family, 3rd ed. (New York: Thunder’s 
Mouth, 2002), and Vincent Bugliosi with Curt Gentry, Helter Skelter (New York: Norton, 1994). 

13 “saw flashes when he closed his eyes”: David Mandel, “Probation Officer’s Report and 
Recommendation, Sadie Mae Glutz aka Susan Denise Atkins,” Superior Court of the State of 
California, in and for the County of Mendocino, Case no. 4503-C, Dept. 2, Aug. 30, 1968, 3. 

14 Brunner’s had just begun: Brunner was arrested in April 1968 with Manson and about a dozen 
other Family members while sleeping beside their parked bus on the Pacific Coast Highway in 
Ventura County. The officers found her week-old baby, Michael Valentine, sleeping alone in the 
bus and charged her with endangering the welfare of a child. She pleaded guilty to a reduced 
charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and was sentenced to two years’ probation, 
though there’s no record she ever met with a probation officer (“‘Hippie’ Mom on Probation, 
Returned Baby,” Oxnard [Calif.] Press Courier, May 14, 1968, 9). 

15 Smith and his wife decided: This was first reported by Sanders in The Family. It was also 
confirmed by Roger Smith, and his ex-wife, Carol, in interviews with me. 

16 Pooh Bear’s temporary foster parents: Ibid. 

17 Alan Rose repaired to Mendocino County: Alan Rose’s involvement with the Family was first 
reported in “M.D. on Manson’s Sex Life: Psychologist Who Lived with Manson Family Tells 
About Commune,” The Berkeley Barb, Jan. 16-22, 1970, 1, 13, and later by Sanders in The Family 
and Smith and Luce in Love Needs Care. It was also confirmed by Rose, David Smith, Roger 
Smith, and others in interviews with me. 

18 “former federal parole officer”: Mandel, “Probation Officer’s Report and Recommendation, Sadie 
Mae Glutz,” 4. 

19 Manson and his “guru’-like hold: David Mandel, “Probation Officer’s Report and 
Recommendation, Mary Theresa Brunner,” Superior Court of the State of California, in and for the 
County of Mendocino, Case no. 4503-C, Dept. No. 2, Sept. 6, 1968, 6. 

20 used her name without her knowledge: Author interview with Carol Smith (who asked to be 
identified by her former last name). 

21 “hostile and possibly vengeful”: Mandel, “Probation Officer’s Report and Recommendation, Sadie 
Mae Glutz,” 10. 

22 “comply willingly”: Ibid., 4. According to the report, the couple said they knew Atkins for 
“approximately three years.” If true, that meant they’d known Atkins since about August 1965, two 
years before she even met Manson. 

23 “manipulated by her present group”: Mandel, “Probation Officer’s Report and Recommendation, 
Mary Theresa Brunner,” 8. 

24 his leniency with the Manson girls: Author interview with Duncan James (one of the deputy district 


attorneys who prosecuted Atkins, Brunner, and the others). 


25 Winslow resurfaced in Los Angeles: The judge’s last day on the bench was January 6, 1969, 
according to the Mendocino County Office of Human Resources. 

26 the attorney for Doris Day and her son, Terry Melcher: Winslow represented the pair in their 
lawsuit against the business partner of Day’s late husband for breach of contract and fraud. 

27 Winslow who accompanied him: Author interview with Tom Johnson; also confirmed by 
Winslow’s widow, Betty, via Johnson (Mrs. Winslow declined to speak to me). 

28 began to use LSD: Smith and Luce, Love Needs Care, 257-58. 

29 Manson had been released from Terminal Island: The information in this section comes from a 
variety of sources, most prominently, Manson’s federal parole file, which I petitioned the U.S. 
Parole Commission for in a nearly two-year-long FOIA process. Other sources were police reports 
and case files I was able to obtain from various county, state, and federal offices, newspaper 
clippings, books (including Love Needs Care and The Family), and interviews, chief among them, 
Roger Smith, David Smith, and Alan Rose. 

30 “sustained history of violence”: Bugliosi and Gentry, Helter Skelter, 203. 

31 “criminally sophisticated”: Ibid. 

32 Years earlier, Manson had had his parole revoked: Angus D. McEachen, Chief U.S. Probation 
Officer, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, “Petition for Action... Praying 
that court will order issuance of bench warrant...,” United States v. Charles Milles Manson, 
Central Division, Docket no. C-27806-CD (“Probationer has failed to submit written monthly 
report since Feb. 5, 1960 [and] to keep the Probation Office notified as to his whereabouts and 
current address”), filed May 25, 1960. Manson’s probation was also revoked in 1956 by the federal 
probation office in Los Angeles for missing a hearing (Bugliosi and Gentry, Helter Skelter, 196). I 
was unable to determine if McEachen was in the office at that time. 

33 “requested and received permission”: Bugliosi and Gentry, Helter Skelter, 203. 

34 The prosecutor had a copy of Manson’s parole file: Ibid., 190-203. 

35 “now within the city of Berkeley, California”: John A. Sprague, Supervising U.S. Probation 
Officer, Northern District of California, letter to Angus D. McEachen, Chief U.S. Probation 
Officer, U.S. Court House, Los Angeles, Apr. 11, 1967. 

36 Robert Heinlein’s: Robert Gillette, “Manson’s Blueprint?: Claim Tate Suspect Used Space-Fiction 
Plot,” Los Angeles Herald Examiner, Jan. 8, 1970, A1—2; “A Martian Model?,” Time, Jan. 19, 
1970, 44-45; Smith and Luce, Love Needs Care, 258. 

37 Roger Smith got a nickname: Gillette, “Manson’s Blueprint?,” A2.; Smith and Luce, Love Needs 
Care, 260. 

38 “no powers of invention”: “A Martian Model?,” 44. 

39 But Roger Smith approved: Smith and Luce, Love Needs Care, 258. 


40 hazy on the details of how he became: I interviewed Smith on the phone several times and in 


person twice, first at his home in Michigan in 2001, and then at his home in Oregon in 2008. 

41 funded by the National Institute of Mental Health: James Robison, Leslie T. Wilkins, Robert M. 
Carter, and Albert Wahl, “Final Report,” The San Francisco Project: A Study of Federal Probation 
and Parole, April 1969, 1 (“This study was supported by a $275,000 Mental Health Project Grant 
from the National Institute of Mental Health”). 

42 The project studied the relationship between: I reviewed the study’s papers at the Special 
Collections Department of the University of California Bancroft Library, Berkeley. This archive— 
catalogued officially as The San Francisco Project, University of California, School of 
Criminology, 1965-1969, Call no. NRLF (UCB) HV9303. C2 no. 14—consists mostly of academic 
papers, with no individual case files or specifics about clients (“No substantive estimate of the 
number and characteristics of these cases appears to be available’—William P. Adams, Paul M. 
Chandler, and M. G. Neithercutt, “The San Francisco Project: A Critique,” Federal Probation, 
Dec. 1971, 46). Neither Smith’s nor Manson’s names appear in the collection. The information in 
this section comes from these UC Berkeley files, as well as news articles and interviews with Smith 
and several other parole and probation officers who worked on the four-year-long study. 

43 The six participating parole officers: Ibid.; author interviews with William P. Adams, M. G. 
Neithercutt, and Roger Smith. 

44 winnowed his set of parolees: Roger Smith was vague about when and if Manson ever became his 
only client, but Gail Sadalla and Alan Rose, both of whom assisted Smith at the Amphetamine 
Research Project, said Manson was the only parolee they were aware of who came to the HAFMC 
for meetings with Smith (author interview with Gail Sadalla; author interviews with Rose). 

45 a few days in 1956: According to Manson’s FBI “rap” sheet, he was held in the Chicago County 
Jail from March 9 through 12, 1956, while awaiting transfer to Los Angeles on a federal probation 
violation (“Charles Milles Manson,” U.S. Department of Justice, FBI Rec, no. 643 369 A, April 15, 
1959). 

46 violent behavior in Oakland gang members: Wallace Turner, “Addiction Linked to Violent Youth: 
‘Rowdies’ Likely to Become Heroin Users, Study Finds,” New York Times, April 30, 1967. 

47 through his own “immersion”: Author interview with R. Smith. 

48 He and the other researchers created “outposts”: Ibid. One of the “projects” initiated by Blumer and 
Smith in 1965—with Smith serving as director—was the Juvenile Add-Center Project, an “action 
research program” for at-risk youth in the flatland district. In an academic paper, Smith described 
the center as a way “to penetrate the drug world... its primary goal is to obtain a clear view of the 
ways into and the ways out of the drug world” (Roger Smith, “Status Politics and the Image of the 
Addict,” Issues in Criminology, Fall 1966, 157, 307-8). 

49 They embraced a “participant-observer” approach: As Smith explained to me, the best way to 


“understand how young people got involved with gangs, how they rationalized what they did, how 


they were able to justify it to recruit other people” was to “suspend judgment” and observe them. 
This included, he acknowledged, not reporting criminal activity he or his researchers might 
witness.

Apr. 18, 1967. 

51 to send Manson to live in the Haight: Author interview with R. Smith; Smith and Luce, Love Needs 
Care, 257 (Smith and Luce maintain that Roger originally turned down Manson’s request to 
relocate to the Haight, but later changed his mind and approved it). 

52 “The summer of love was just”: George Varga, “The Summer of Love, an Epic Tipping Point for 
Music and Youth Culture, Turns 50,” San Diego Union-Tribune, May 27, 2017. 

53 “A new nation has grown”: Peter Conners, White Hand Society: The Psychedelic Partnership of

55 “seemed to accept the world”: Ibid., 257. 

56 “He appears to be in better shape”: Roger Smith to Joseph Shore, Parole Executive, U.S. Board of 
Parole, July 31, 1967. 

57 At the time, Manson was sitting in a jail cell: All the information about Manson’s arrest and 
conviction in July 1967 is from police reports, news clippings, and interviews with the officers 
involved in the arrest, as well as with Dean Moorehouse (the father of Ruth Ann Moorehouse), 
who witnessed it. 

58 merited only a footnote: Bugliosi did mention that Manson received a three-year probation sentence 
(Bugliosi and Gentry, Helter Skelter, 315), but he never said what happened to Manson’s probation 
supervision for his 1967 conviction. And I’ve never found any evidence that it was enforced, let 
alone enacted. 

59 permitted into evidence during the trial: The information in this section is from the testimony of 
Samuel Barrett (Manson’s final parole officer), who was called during the death-penalty phase of 
the trial by Kanarek, in an effort to gain access to Manson’s parole records (California v. Charles 
Manson, Susan Atkins, Leslie Van Houten and Patricia Krenwinkel, case 22239, 22132-203). 

60 he dispatched David Anderson: Ibid., 22161-74. 

61 “incriminate the Attorney General”: Ibid., 22193. 

62 “four inches thick”: Ibid., 22177. 

63 occurred under his watch: Author interview with R. Smith. 

64 to travel to Mexico: Smith to Shore, July 31, 1967. 

65 Manson had been arrested in Mexico: Manson v. United States, “Forma Pauperis Affidavit,” no. 
64-585-WM,, filed Apr. 8, 1964 (Manson filed a motion arguing that his 1959 arrest in Mexico and 


reparation to the United States were unfair because he was unable to understand the proceedings in 


the Mexican court). 

66 “Manson is not to leave”: There were two overlapping notes, one typed and one handwritten; the 
first, cited here, is Joseph Shore to Albert Wahl, Chief U.S. Probation Officer, San Francisco, Aug. 
25, 1967.

Brunner,” 5 (“They have also visited Southern California and Mexico lately”). 

75 Susan Atkins’s probation officers: Yates to McFarlan, Nov. 10, 1967, 1-2. Yates wrote: “Today 
they leave for Los Angeles and then on to Florida. I told her she was not to leave without the 
permission of the Oregon Probation Department, but I am just as certain she will do as she 
pleases.” See also Madison, Memo to File, Nov. 14, 1967. Madison wrote: “At 3:15 pm Atkins 
called and advised she was going on trip with or without permission.” 

76 quite a bit of time in Mexico: Mandel, “Probation Officer’s Report and Recommendation, Mary 
Theresa Brunner.” 

77 “your status leaves much to be desired”: Samuel Barrett to Charles Manson, June 12, 1968, in 
Manson’s federal parole file. 

78 Barrett was the parole officer: Bugliosi and Gentry, Helter Skelter, 546-47.

Prisons; Posch to O’ Neill, June 4, 2001, 1. 

83 that file was missing, too: Author interview with Victoria Hardin, Director, Office of History, 
National Institute of Health. Using the information I gave her, Hardin was unable to find any 
record of the San Francisco Project in her archive, which inherited the NIMH files after several 
reorganizations of the program. 

84 The headline: Charles Hillinger, “Wayward Bus Stuck in Ditch: Deputy Finds Nude Hippies 
Asleep in Weeds,” Los Angeles Times, Apr. 23, 1968, 3, 23. See also: “Nine Nude Hippies

102 used by the CIA as a funding front: Edwin M. Long Jr., Deputy Director, Scientific and Public 
Information, NIMH, letter to Joseph J. Petrillo and Timothy Sullivan, Sept. 30, 1976, National 
Security Archives, George Washington University, Washington, D.C. 

103 “way in which violence”: Roger Smith, “The Marketplace of Speed: Violence and Compulsive 
Methamphetamine Abuse” (PhD diss., University of California, Berkeley, 1969), 5. 


104 “asking me to help them with the law”: Smith and Luce, Love Needs Care, 36. 

105 Hiding in a “deviant group”: Smith, “The Marketplace of Speed.” 

106 anonymity in all reports: Ibid., 136. 

107 opened the previous summer: When it finally received funding in May 1968, ARP was moved to 
the clinic’s “annex,” one block away (Smith and Luce, Love Needs Care, 36). 

108 why not just meet: Smith was vague in his interviews with me (as were David Smith and Luce in 
their book) about when his professional relationship with Manson ended and the personal one 
began. Smith told Ed Sanders, for instance, that he stopped being a parole officer in January 1968, 
when he began work at the clinic (Sanders, The Family, 460-61), but in a résumé Smith shared 
with me, he lists the date of his departure from the probation office as May 1968. David Smith and 
Luce put the start of Roger’s work at the HAFMC as January 1968 (36) but other sources told me it 
was the fall of 1967 (author interviews with Rose, Sadalla, and Ernest Dernburg). Whatever the 
case, Manson was visiting Roger Smith at the clinic in some capacity in the spring of ’68, as Smith 
and Luce report Roger saying in their book: “I ceased being his parole officer in 1968, when I 
started working at the Medical Section, so [Manson] had no real reason to spend so much time with 
me. But he came anyway, preaching about love” (257). 


109 Soon Manson became a mainstay: Smith and Luce, Love Needs Care, 36, 255-62. 


10. The Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic 


1 David Elvin Smith grew up: This section relies primarily on Smith’s writing in Love Needs Care 
(cowritten by John Luce; Boston: Little, Brown, 1971) and in his self-published Journal of 
Psychedelic Drugs. A biography of Smith by Clark S. Sturges, Dr. Dave: A Profile of David E. 
Smith, M.D., Founder of the Haight Ashbury Free Clinics (Walnut Creek, Calif.: Devil Mountain 
Books, 1993), was also heavily resourced. 

2 “high on the same substance”: Ariel Zeitlin Cooke, “Volunteer Doctor, The Free Clinic at 33: How 
a Radical Idea Became a Model Institution,” Diversion, April 2000. 

3 “Charlie’s girls,” as they were known: Author interview with Robert Conrich. 

4 They referred to him as Christ, or “J.C.”: Vincent Bugliosi with Curt Gentry, Helter Skelter (New 
York: Norton, 1994), 315. 

5 “reprogram” his followers: The information about Manson’s methods of “reprogramming” his 
followers during the Haight period is from Smith and Luce, Love Needs Care, 259-63, unless 
otherwise noted. 

6 a phrase David claims to have coined: Author interview with David Smith. 

7 But Manson had an aversion: Smith and Luce, Love Needs Care, 258-59. 


8 “mitigating circumstances”: Ibid. 


9 a “capsule” of speed: Manson, Cineplex Productions, 2009. 

10 In books and at parole hearings, Susan Atkins: Susan Atkins with Bob Slosser, Child of Satan, 
Child of God (Plainfield, N.J.: Logos International, 1977), 135; Susan Atkins, Subsequent Parole 
Consideration Hearing, State of California Board of Prison Terms, in the Matter of the Life Term 
Parole Consideration Hearing of Susan Atkins, CDC Inmate W-08340, June 1, 2005, multiple 
references. 

11 both nights of the murders: Tex Watson and Chaplain Ray, Will You Die for Me? (Old Tappan, 
N.J.: Fleming H. Revell, 1978), 131, 141. 

12 brooding on his delusions: Susan Atkins-Whitehouse, The Myth of Helter Skelter, (San Juan 
Capistrano, Calif.: Menelorelin Dorenay, 2012), 63. 

13 a short essay for Life magazine: Roger Smith and David Smith, “A Doctor and a Parole Officer 
Remember Manson,” Life, Dec. 1, 1969, 26. 

14 only the third reporter: Not counting his December 1969 Life essay and his interview for 1971’s 
Love Needs Care, Roger Smith spoke to Ed Sanders for The Family in 1971 (but his quotes weren’t 
attributed to him until Sanders’s 2002 update, 460-61) and the cable channel A&E for its 
documentary Charles Manson: Journey into Evil (1995). 

15 “If you love everything, you don’t”: Smith and Luce, Love Needs Care, 257-58. 

16 “Charlie’s ability to draw”: Author interview with Alan Rose. 

17 “was always kind of fascinated”: Author interview with Carol Smith. 

18 “he had made an error”: Author interview with Ernest Dernburg. 

19 “bringing operations to a standstill”: Smith and Luce, Love Needs Care, 260. 

20 One reason the HAFMC was free: Much of Love Needs Care recounts David Smith’s never-ending 
battle to keep the clinic open in the first few years. Although he told me in interviews that it never 
received federal grants, he clearly states in the book (36) that Roger Smith’s ARP was funded by a 
$37,000 grant from the NIMH in May 1968, and several papers published by Smith and his 
colleagues at the HAFMC acknowledge the NIMH for funding. 

21 “I always thought there would be problems”: Author interview with Lyle Grosjean. 

22 “He was going to soothe the savage beast”: Author interview with Dernburg. 

23 never actually received his PhD: Author interview with D. Smith. 

24 published a brief article: The story is an almost word-for-word copy of the thesis of Charles M. 
Fischer, one of the four researchers, who received his master’s in pharmacology at the University 
of California, San Francisco, in 1968. I obtained a copy of the thesis from the university. Smith told 
me that it was originally his PhD dissertation; he “gave” it to Fischer when he realized he wasn’t 
going to finish his doctorate. Fischer denied Smith’s assertion. Fischer’s name—along with those 
of Smith, Eugene Schoenfeld, and Charles H. Hine—appeared on the paper when it was published 
the following year in the HAFMC’s Journal of Psychedelic Drugs under the same title, 


“Behavioral Mediators in the Polyphasic Mortality Curve of Aggregate Amphetamine Toxicity” 
(vol. 2 [Spring 1969]: 55-72). A revised version of the article was published in a bound collection 
of Journal articles in 1973. 

25 sixteen albino mice: The information in this section comes from interviews with David Smith and 
Schoenfeld and Fischer, Smith’s coresearchers in the mice study. (Hine died in 1991.) The 
scientific data is taken directly from version of the paper published in 1969 in Journal of 
Psychedelic Drugs, except where specified. The similarities of Smith’s animal research to the 
formation of the Manson Family were first reported by Carol Greene (a pseudonym) in a German 
book published by the right-wing Lyndon LaRouche Organization, Der Fall Charles Manson: 
Morder aus der Retorte (n.p.: E.I.R., 1992). I was able to obtain an English translation (The Test 
Tube Murders; no publication data available) and speak to “Greene” in 2003. Some of her findings 
were substantiated during my independent investigation and expanded on (others were impossible 
to corroborate). “Greene” told me she’d severed ties with the LaRouche organization and no longer 
had her research files. She didn’t interview anyone for her book and relied mostly on Smith’s 
articles and Love Needs Care, from which she drew her theories. 

26 “frenzied attacks of unrelenting rage”: Smith and Luce, Love Needs Care, 16. See also author 
interview with D. Smith. 

27 dismembered body parts: Fischer, a twenty-four-year-old graduate student at the time, had to check 
on the mice in eight-hour intervals, often in the middle of the night. “It was brutal,” he told me of 
the carnage he’d encounter. “There was no rhyme or reason—it was just helter skelter.” 

28 “consume the drugs in crowded atmospheres”: Smith and Luce, Love Needs Care, 16. 

29 “lashed out with murderous rage”: Ibid., 19. 

30 “like rats in a cage”: Ibid., 222. 

31 Suggestibility was among: According to the Journal of Psychedelic Drugs article, the objective of 
research was twofold: to discover which drugs would “modify” the violence of the animals caused 
by amphetamine and aggregation and, more important, what existing “behavioral” factors made 
some animals violent enough to kill, and to isolate those factors. See Fischer et al., “Behavioral 
Mediators,” 56. 

32 they’re rats: Smith and Luce, Love Needs Care, multiple references; David Smith and Donald R. 
Wesson, eds., Uppers and Downers (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall, 1974), 47. 

33 Schoenfeld insisted that he’d worked with rats: Author interview with Eugene Schoenfeld. Fischer 
asked me whether David Smith was on “drugs” when he told me the research was on rats. “I’m 
surprised that David wouldn’t remember that,” he said during our interview, “they were Balt-C. I 
was the one who ordered those damn mice and I was the one who shot them up.” 

34 David Smith’s research was funded: D. E. Smith, C. M. Fischer, and C. H. Hine, “Effects of 
Chlorpromazine, Phenobarbital, and Iproniazid on the Polyphasic Mortality Curve of Aggregate 


Amphetamine,” from “Abstracts of Papers for the Sixth Annual Meeting of the Society of 
Toxicology, Atlanta, Georgia, March 23-25, 1967,” Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 10 
(1967): 378-411. The abstract contains this notation on p. 403: “Supported in part by U.S. Public 
Service Toxicology Training Grant No. 5 TO1 GM01304-02.” 

35 rape, murder, cannibalism, and infanticide: The information in this section is from Calhoun’s paper, 
unless otherwise noted: John B. Calhoun, “Population Density and Social Pathology,” Scientific 
American 206, no. 2 (Feb. 1962): 139-49. 

36 “that can be found within [the] group”: Ibid., 144. 

37 “a lasting impact on the individual’s personality”: William McGlothlin, Sidney Cohen, and 
Marcella McGlothlin, “Long Lasting Effects of LSD on Normals,” Journal of Psychedelic Drugs 3, 
no. 1 (Sept. 1970): 20-31 (reprinted from Archives of General Psychiatry 17, no. 5 [Nov. 1967]: 
521-32). 

38 feelings of “frustrated anger” led people: Kay Blacker, “Chronic Users of LSD: The ‘Acidheads,’” 
Journal of Psychedelic Drugs 3, no. 1 (Sept. 1970): 32. 

39 “the psychedelic syndrome”: According to a paper he later wrote, Smith first presented this theory 
in a lecture at the University of California, San Francisco, between the fall of 1967 and spring of 
1968. See David E. Smith, “Changing Patterns of Drug Abuse in Haight-Ashbury,” California 
Medicine, Feb. 1969. 

40 “the emergence of a dramatic orientation”: David E. Smith, “LSD and the Psychedelic Syndrome,” 
Clinical Toxicology 2, no. 1 (Mar. 1969): 69-73. 

41 “Charlie could probably be diagnosed”: R. Smith and D. Smith, “A Doctor and a Parole Officer 
Remember Manson,” 26. 

42 a criminology paper: Roger Smith, “Status Politics and the Image of the Addict,” Issues in 
Criminology, Fall 1966. All of the information in this section is taken directly from Smith’s article. 

43 But as Grogan wrote: Emmett Grogan, Ringolevio: A Life Played for Keeps (Boston: Little, Brown, 
1972), 290. 

44 Rose was a friend of Roger: Author interview with Rose. 

45 A former rabbinical student: The information about Rose comes primarily from Smith and Luce, 
Love Needs Care, and from interviews with Rose, David Smith, Roger Smith, Gail Sadalla, and 
others who worked alongside him at the clinic. 

46 Rose and David went on to coauthor three studies of the Haight’s drug culture in the Journal of 
Psychedelic Drugs: “LSD: Its Use, Abuse, and Suggested Treatment,” vol. 1, no. 2 (Winter 1967— 
68): 117-28; “Incidents Involving the Haight-Ashbury Population and Some Uncommonly Used 
Drugs,” vol. 1, no. 2 (Winter 1967—68), cowritten with Frederick Meyers; and “The Group 
Marriage Commune: A Case Study,” vol. 3, no. 1 (Sept. 1970): 115-19. 


47 probably on Manson’s orders: Smith and Luce, Love Needs Care, 263; author interview with Rose; 


author interview with D. Smith; author interview with Sadalla. 

48 until Manson summoned them: Smith and Luce, Love Needs Care, 263; author interview with 
Rose. 

49 he was living on money funneled: Author interview with Rose; author interview with D. Smith. 

50 he stayed with them: Ibid. (both); Smith and Luce, Love Needs Care, 263. 

51 “in the strange communal phenomenon”: Smith and Luce, Love Needs Care, 263. 

52 one’s subjects broke the law: Roger Smith, “The Marketplace of Speed: Violence and Compulsive 
Methamphetamine Abuse” (PhD diss., University of California, Berkeley, 1969), 3, 136. 

53 The first was Roger’s ARP dissertation: author interview with Rose. 

54 the first-ever scholarly study: Smith and Rose, “The Group Marriage Commune,” 115-19. 

55 a January 1970 interview: “M.D. on Manson’s Sex Life: Psychologist Who Lived with Manson 
Family Tells About Commune,” The Berkeley Barb, Jan. 16-22, 1970. 

56 a point they’d finesse later: Smith and Rose, “The Group Marriage Commune,” 115-16. 

57 the others moved into Rose’s home: Smith and Luce, Love Needs Care, 256-64. 

58 He didn’t interview any: author interviews with D. Smith, R. Smith, Rose, and Vincent Bugliosi. 
Rose isn’t mentioned in Helter Skelter. 

59 as if Bugliosi had actually spoken to him: Bugliosi and Gentry, Helter Skelter, 225. 

60 “sex, not drugs, was the common denominator”: Ibid., 226. 

61 to prove “domination”: Ibid., 287. 

62 ran their front-page stories: The Los Angeles Free Press, sister publication to the Barb, ran the 
identical story a week later (Jan. 23—29, 1970). 

63 “the dictatorial leader of the Family”: Bugliosi and Gentry, Helter Skelter, 413. 

64 “served as absolute ruler”: Smith and Rose, “The Group Marriage Commune,” 116. 

65 if they were acting under their own free will: Bugliosi addressed the quandary in Helter Skelter, 
writing: “I was giving the attorneys for the three girls a ready-made defense. In the penalty phase 
of the trial they could argue that since Atkins, Krenwinkel and Van Houten were totally under 
Manson’s domination, they were not nearly as culpable as he” (Bugliosi and Gentry, Helter Skelter, 
415). 

66 to “modify” their behavior: Fischer et al., “Behavioral Mediators,” 28. 

67 “long-term psychological tendencies”: Smith and Luce, Love Needs Care, 16. 

68 Some made reference to a forthcoming paper: In Charles Fischer’s own master’s thesis, a footnote 
refers to D. E. Smith, C. M. Fischer, A. J. Rose, and F. M. Meyers, “Patterns of Amphetamine 
Toxicity in the Haight-Ashbury,” which is forthcoming from the Journal of Psychedelic Drugs; 
and a footnote in Smith, “Changing Drug Patterns in the Haight-Ashbury,” refers to D. E. Smith, C. 
M. Fischer, and R. Smith, “Toxicity of High Dose Methamphetamine Abuse,” which is then “in 


press” at the same journal. 


69 both Roger Smith and Alan Rose: David E. Smith and Charles M. Fischer, “Acute Amphetamine 
Toxicity,” Journal of Psychedelic Drugs 2, no. 2 (Spring 1969). 

70 the government had been notified: The two documents are: Manson, Charles Willis [sic], Bureau of 
Criminal Identification and Investigation, Sacramento, “Crime Report,” Case no. 25544, “Date and 
Time Reported to Department: 7-28-1967, 01:00 PM”; and Manson, Charles Milles, U.S. 
Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation (Rap Sheet), Record no. 643 369 A, Apr. 
30, 1968, 5. 

71 “the federal guys didn’t mess up”: Author interview with Richard Wood. 

72 “comply willingly with any probationary conditions”: David Mandel, “Probation Officer’s Report 
and Recommendation, Sadie Mae Glutz aka Susan Denise Atkins,” Superior Court of the State of 
California, in and for the County of Mendocino, Case no. 4503-C, Dept. 2, Aug. 30, 1968, 4. I was 
able to finally show Roger Smith his probation recommendations for Atkins and Brunner at our last 
meeting in 2008. He said he had no recollection of making the statements attributed to him and 
added they didn’t “sound” like him, anyway. “I would never say ‘unconventional lifestyle,’” he 


told me. 


11. Mind Control 


1 Born in Brooklyn in 1924: Two invaluable books I relied on for West’s biographical information are 
Anthony Kales, Chester M. Pierce, and Milton Greenblatt, eds. The Mosaic of Contemporary 
Psychiatry in Perspective (New York: Springer-Verlag, 1992) and John West, The Last 
Goodnights: Assisting My Parents with Their Suicides (Berkeley, Calif.: Counterpoint, 2009). The 
latter is a memoir by one of West’s three children, recalling life with his father and the decision he 
made to assist both his parents when they chose to end their lives after being diagnosed with 
terminal illnesses. No one in West’s family would talk to me, but I interviewed dozens of his 
colleagues and friends, dating all the way back to his time as the head of the psychiatric unit at the 
Lackland Air Force Base. His archive at the Department of Special Collections at the Charles 
Young Library at UCLA—hereinafter cited as West Archive—provided me with the clearest 
picture of the true nature of his research. 

2 equal rights for African Americans: Robert S. Pynoos, “Violence, Personality, and Post-Traumatic 
Stress Disorder: Development and Political Perspectives,” in Mosaic of Contemporary Psychiatry, 
71-72. 

3 suffered an “acute psychotic break”: Hubert Winston Smith, letter to Joe Tonahill, May 11, 1964, 
West Archive. 

4 making him sound unhinged: “Testimony of Jack Ruby,” Warren Commission volumes, 5H208-211, 
June 7, 1964, 181-213. 


5 he prevailed on his son: West, The Last Goodnights. 

6 no record of his participation: Douglas McAdam (former director of the Center for Advanced Study 
in the Behavioral Science at Stanford, after West’s time there), email to author; Julie Schumaker 
(Center for Advanced Study, researcher), email to author. McAdam and Schumaker said that West 
never provided a “Statement of Purpose” or “Year End Report,” both required of all participants. 

7 and skipping haircuts: West, letter to Fred Pumpian-Mindlin (one of the researchers), June 20, 1967, 
West Archive. 

8 a “remarkable substance”: West and A. Mandell, “Hallucinogens,” Comprehensive Textbook of 
Psychiatry, ed. Alfred M. Freedman and Harold I. Kaplan (Baltimore: Williams and Wilkins, 
1967), 247-53. According to the book’s editors, West’s chapter was completed in 1966. 

9 “negate their egos”: David E. Smith and John Luce, Love Needs Care (Boston: Little, Brown, 1971), 
259. 

10 in America’s “bohemian” quarters: West and Mandell, “Hallucinogens,” 252. 

11 “crackpots” who hypnotized: West and Gordon H. Deckert, “Dangers of Hypnosis,” Journal of the 
American Medical Association 192, no. 1 (Apr. 1965): 9-12. 

12 You’d never know from his published writing: In the many papers written by West, he never once 
mentioned his own drug experiments with human subjects, just those conducted by other 
researchers. 

13 a crumbling Victorian house: West published several academic papers about the Haight-Ashbury 
Project, all of which will be cited in this section, but the most relevant information was obtained 
from his archive at UCLA, which contains the diaries of many of the researchers who participated 
in the program. I interviewed several of the researchers as well as others who knew of the project 
through their work with West at the HAFMC that summer. 

14 a “laboratory” disguised as a “hippie crash pad”: West and James R. Allen, “Flight from Violence: 
Hippies and the Green Rebellion,” American Journal of Psychiatry 125, no. 3 (Sept. 1968): 365; 
West, James R. Allen, and Joshua Kaufman, “Runaways, Hippies and Marijuana,” American 
Journal of Psychiatry 126, no. 5 (Nov. 1969): 163. 

15 “semi-permanent observation post”: West and James R. Allen, “The Green Rebellion,” Sooner, 
Nov. 1967, 6. 

16 “with posters, flowers and paint”: Ibid. 

17 could furnish willing subjects: Author interview with David Smith; author interview with James 
Allen. 

18 records in West’s files: See, for instance, West, Allen, and Kaufman, “Runaways, Hippies and 
Marijuana,” which contains this acknowledgment: “This study was supported in part by a grant 
from the Foundations Fund for Research in Psychiatry, by a fellowship award from the Center for 


Advanced Study in Behavioral Sciences, Stanford, Calif., awarded to Dr. West, and by Public 


Health Service Grant MH-35063 from National Institute of Mental Health.” 

19 the agency’s first “disguised laboratory”: The first and still definitive book on the MKULTRA 
program is by the former State Department official who compelled the agency to release its 
financial records: John Marks, The Search for the Manchurian Candidate: The CIA and Mind 
Control (New York: Norton, 1979). I also reviewed Marks’s files (CIA Behavior Experiments 
Collection—John Marks Donation, National Security Archive, Gehlman Library, George 
Washington University, Washington, D.C.); for records of “Operation Midnight Climax,” the “safe 
house” projects run by George Hunter White in New York City and San Francisco in the 1960s, I 
reviewed White’s papers (George White Papers, 1932—1970, collection no. M1111), at Stanford 
University, in the library’s department of special collections. Other invaluable books on 
MKULTRA include Martin A. Lee and Bruce Shlain, Acid Dreams: The CIA, LSD, and the Sixties 
Rebellion (New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1985); Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair, 
Whiteout: The CIA, Drugs and the Press (London: Verso, 1998); and Alan W. Scheflin and 
Edward M. Opton, The Mind Manipulators (New York: Paddington Press, 1978). An additional 
resource was the published transcripts of Project MKULTRA, the CIA’s Program of Research in 
Behavioral Modification, Joint Hearing Before the Select Committee on Intelligence and the 
Subcommittee on Human Resources, U.S. Senate, 95th Congress, 1st Sess., Aug. 3, 1977 
(Washington, D.C.: GPO, 1977); and Human Drug Testing by the CIA, 1977, Hearings before the 
Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research of the Committee on Human Resources, U.S. 
Senate, 95th Congress, 1st Sess., Sept. 20-21, 1977 (Washington, D.C.: GPO, 1977); hereafter 
referred to as the Kennedy-Inouye Hearings. The information that follows comes primarily from 
these sources. 

20 “I was a very minor missionary”: Troy Hooper, “Operation Midnight Climax: How the CIA Dosed 
S.F. Citizens with LSD,” S.F. Weekly, Mar. 14, 2012. 

21 Mass Conversion: Marks, Search for the Manchurian Candidate, 170. A sanitized description of 
the project was released to the university by the CIA in 1977 (CIA MORI DocID: 17358); see 
Mick Hinton, “1950s OU Study Funded by CIA,” Oklahoman, Sept. 21, 1977, 4. 

22 funds came from Sidney J. Gottlieb: Marks, Search for the Manchurian Candidate, 170; Hinton, 
“1950s OU Study,” 4. As both Marks and Hinton reported—and I documented in West’s files—the 
research was paid for by the Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology (also called the 
Human Ecology Fund), run by an air force colonel named James Monroe, and by the Geschickter 
Fund for Medical Research, both exposed during the 1970s congressional investigations as “cut- 
outs” for the CIA’s MKULTRA program. 

23 “bleed the energies of the hippie movement”: West and Allen, “The Green Rebellion,” 32. 

24 He was at work on a book: Memorandum of Agreement: Louis Jolyon West and the McGraw-Hill 


Book Company, for a work entitled Experimental Psychopathology: The Induction of Abnormal 


States, Aug. 27, 1968, West Archive. 

25 By the early seventies he removed the title: I found the book listed as “in preparation” in a 
curriculum vitae dated Apr. 10, 1967 and another dated with just the year 1968, but in no version of 
West’s CVs after that (West Archive). 

26 Kathy Collins: All the information regarding Collins’s experience is taken directly from her diary, 
which is in the West Archive. I searched for Collins for years, only to learn in 2012 that she died 
around 2007. 

27 When West made one of his rare appearances: Ibid., entry of July 11, 1969. 

28 the CIA began to experiment on humans: Much of the information in this section comes from the 
books cited above: Marks, Search for the Manchurian Candidate; Lee and Shlain, Acid Dreams; 
Scheflin and Opton, The Mind Manipulators; and Cockburn and St. Clair, Whiteout. Also 
indispensable were the files of John Marks at the National Security Archive; the Rockefeller 
Commission report: The President’s Commission on CIA Activities Within the United States 
(Washington, D.C.: GPO, 1975); the Church Committee report: The United States Senate Select 
Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (Washington, 
D.C.: GPO, 1976); and the transcripts of the Kennedy-Inouye Hearings from 1977.

52 “may never come out”: “Control C.I.A., Not Behavior,” editorial, New York Times, Aug. 5, 1977, 
16. 


53 That program never coalesced: The closest thing was an in-house investigation by the CIA, called 


the Victims Task Force. Unsurprisingly, the three-man team of agents (two from the CIA, one from 


the DEA) turned up only two victims of MKULTRA, both women. Each had been unwittingly 


dosed with LSD at a party in Greenwich Village on January 11, 1953 (one of the women received a 


$15,000 settlement from the federal government, the other was deceased). 

54 The New York Times identified him: Nicholas M. Horrock, “Private Institutions Used in C.I.A. 
Effort to Control Behavior: $25 Million Program,” New York Times, Aug. 2, 1977, A-1. 

55 not one researcher: Further, I spoke to Robert H. Wiltse and Frank Laubinger, the two CIA agents 
on the task force, and they told me they never even contacted a university or other facility where 
MKULTRA research had occurred. Their seven-month investigation consisted of contacting less 
than half a dozen people who were named in the diary of George H. White, the CIA agent who 
conducted experiments in safe houses in New York and San Francisco between 1953 and 1965. 
When I asked Wiltse why the academic institutions and federal facilities where most of the 
MKULTRA research occurred had been ignored, he replied that he “didn’t know.” When pressed, 
he said it “didn’t seem necessary,” adding that he never even left the CIA headquarters in Langley, 
during the investigation. Laubinger told me that he was the one who investigated the safe houses 
operated by White, and that he believed Wiltse was responsible for investigating the academic 
institutions. Laubinger called Gottlieb “an honorable man who was dealt a blow” by the 


congressional investigations. He said if the communists had mind control technology in their 


arsenal, “Well, maybe we ought to have it too.” 

56 “a secret twenty-five year”: Horrock, “Private Institutions.” 

57 “I’m just drawing a total blank here”: Author interview with Stansfield Turner. 

58 “CIA operators and agents”: Marks, Search for the Manchurian Candidate, 97. 

59 The first one was dated June 11, 1953: All the information that follows is taken directly from this

previous day’s testimony as “more a portrayal of a group of bumbling amateurs than of American 
James Bonds.”

Hinton, “O.U. Mind Control Experiments Bared: School Told CIA Funded Secret Tests,” Saturday 
Oklahoman and Times, Sept. 3, 1977. 

81 were CIA fronts: “C.I.A. Tells Oklahoma U.”; Hinton, “O.U. Mind Control Experiments Bared”; 
Andy Rieger, “Sharp Informed of CIA Projects,” Oklahoma Daily, Sept. 30, 1977, 1.

Walden, “CIA Grants Shown: Report ‘Heavily Censored,’” Oklahoma Daily, Oct. 1, 1977, 1-2. 
83 through his retirement in 1988: West, letter to the editor, San Francisco Examiner, Mar. 31, 1988, 

1-3, West Archive. “The statement that I was a paid consultant to the CIA and one of its ‘top 
hypnotists’ is false,” wrote West. A few months later, West wrote to another magazine: “I have 
never worked for the CIA” (West, letter to Michael Sigman, editor of LA Weekly, June 2, 1988, 
West Archive). 

84 “sought and received my counsel”: West, letter to Marvin Karno, M.D., Robert O. Pasnau, M.D.,

85 “in Goebbels’ tradition of the Big Lie”: West, letter to the editor, Summer Bruin, June 27, 1993, 2, 
ibid. 

86 “The Center for the Story and Reduction of Violence”: The information about West’s Violence 
Center is from news articles; congressional and state assembly testimony; interviews with 
colleagues of West (both involved in the proposed project and opposed to it); and, most 
prominently, several drafts of the project in West’s hand from his files in the West Archive—these 
documents reveal his efforts to tamp down the project’s more radical objectives in response to the 
growing public outcry. 

87 Governor Ronald Reagan: Reagan unveiled West’s plan in his State of the State address to the 
legislature on January 11, 1973. See William Endicott, “$850 Million Surplus in Taxes Told; 
Reagan Calls for Refunds,” Los Angeles Times, Jan. 12, 1973, A-1. 

88 “remote monitoring devices”: West, “Center for Prevention of Violence, Neuropsychiatric Institute, 
UCLA,” Sept. 1, 1972 (first draft of project proposal), 5, West Archive; Staff of the Subcommittee 
on Constitutional Rights of the Committee of the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, 93rd Congress, 2nd Sess., 
Individual Rights and the Federal Role in Behavior Modification (Washington, D.C.: GPO, 
November 1974), 13, 35-37. 

89 threatened “privacy and self-determination”: Individual Rights and the Federal Role, 34. 

90 helped to prosecute Manson: Among the agencies contacted by West for help in “developing plans” 


for the Violence Center were the Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles District Attorney’s 
office, and the office of California Attorney General Evelle Younger (ibid., 348). 

91 He’d appeared as a witness many times: West’s highest profile appearance as an expert witness in a 
brainwashing case came later, however, at the trial of kidnapped heiress Patty Hearst in 1976. Two 
of West’s staff at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute, Keith Ditman and Joel Hochman, testified 
for the defense during the death-penalty phase of the Tate—LaBianca trial (Vincent Bugliosi with 
Curt Gentry, Helter Skelter [New York: Norton, 1994], 572-79). 

92 “that it can be done”: Author interview with D. Smith. In the same interview, Smith expressed 
surprise when I mentioned MKULTRA, saying he’d never heard of it—or that the CIA gave LSD 
to citizens, even in San Francisco, without their knowledge. 

93 so often described as “hypnotic”: Bugliosi and Gentry, Helter Skelter, 615. 

94 taught Manson how to hypnotize: Ed Sanders, The Family, 3rd ed. (New York: Thunder’s Mouth, 
2002), 43. 

95 Deanyer had learned hypnosis in the navy: A FOIA to the FBI resulted in the release of forty-seven 
heavily redacted pages of a forty-nine-page file (FOIPA no. 0961945-000). The file confirmed that 
Deanyer, born Burnie William Smith Jr., on June 3, 1934, in Wheeling, West Virginia, learned 
hypnotism while stationed in Pearl Harbor with the U.S. Navy, between 1942 and 1946. After 
changing his name and opening the Deanyer School of Hypnotism in Honolulu, he was indicted in 
1956 on charges of sex trafficking underage girls. At his trial, prosecutors presented evidence that 
he’d used hypnotism to induce female students at his school to become prostitutes. Several police 
officers testified that when they interviewed the victims they still “appeared to be in a trance and 
would say nothing [redacted] and refused to testify against him.” 

96 her father teaching Manson: Author interview with Robin Border. In addition, I reviewed the 
transcript of a taped interview Martin Lee conducted with Deanyer in the seventies. Deanyer told 
Lee that he “talked to Manson frequently,” adding, “the things, believe it or not, that he was asking 
me about were not on control... [but] expanded capabilities under hypnosis” (Lee interview with 
Deanyer, July 31, 1978; transcript courtesy of Philip Melanson). 

97 “The most puzzling question of all”: Bugliosi and Gentry, Helter Skelter, 626. 

98 After midnight on July 4, 1954: The information in this section is from trial transcripts, newspaper 
clippings, West’s personal file in the West Archive, and interviews with over fifty people who were 
connected to the case. 

99 “dazed” and “trance-like”: Charles L. Theall testimony, Texas v. Jimmy N. Shaver, case no. 2552, 
409.

111 “took your clothes off, Jimmy”: West, “‘Amytal Interview,’” 6—14. 

112 a play about it: Gilbert Rose, The Eve of the Fourth: A Docudrama in Four Acts (Madison, Conn.: 
International Universities Press, 1996). Rose also wrote an academic paper on the case: “Screen 
Memories in Homicidal Acting Out,” Psychoanalytic Quarterly 29 (1960): 328-43. 

113 maintained his innocence the whole time: Don Reid and John Gurwell, Have a Seat, Please 
(Huntsville: Texas Review Press, 2001), 37-40. 

114 the day Shaver was sentenced to death: West, transcript of lecture about Shaver case, June 15, 
1956, 8, West Archive. 

115 against capital punishment: Milton Greenblatt, “LJ West’s Place in Social and Community 
Psychiatry,” in Mosaic of Contemporary Psychiatry, 9. 

116 most surreal belonged to Tusko: Information in this section is primarily from news coverage, 
papers by West and other academics, and interviews with West’s colleagues at the University of 
Oklahoma, including Chester M. Pierce, who assisted West in the experiment and coauthored their 
paper about it. 

117 Sidney Gottlieb had funded it: Author interview with Gordon Deckert; Richard Green, “The Early 
Years: Jolly West and the University of Oklahoma Department of Psychiatry,” Journal of the 
Oklahoma State Medical Association 93, no. 9 (Sept. 2000): 451.

the West Archive. 

127 “the department was worried”: Author interview with Deckert. 

128 “source was payment from the CIA”: Ibid. Deckert also told me it was his understanding that 
West’s objective was to create an “artificial musth.” 

129 Foundations Fund for Research in Psychiatry, Inc.: West and Pierce, “Lysergic Acid 
Diethylamide,” 1103. 

130 and again involving Lawrence Schiller: Jack Ruby and William Read Woodfield, “My Story,” 
Long Beach Press Telegram, Jan. 28, 1964, 1, 8. According to multiple accounts, including the 
testimony of Ruby’s brother, Earl Ruby, to the Warren Commission (14: 402-3) and a memoir by 
Ruby’s first attorney, Melvin Belli (Belli with Robert Blair Kaiser, My Life on Trial [New York: 
William Morrow, 1976], 255-56), within seventy-two hours of Oswald’s murder, Schiller had 
made a deal with the Ruby family to allow his associate, William Read Woodfield, to secretly 
obtain access to Ruby in jail and then publish a first-person account of the Oswald shooting. 

131 Ruby “lost [his] senses”: Ruby and Woodfield, “My Story,” Jan. 29, 1969, 3, 8. 

132 “a ‘fugue state’ with subsequent amnesia”: Melvin Belli and Maurice C. Carroll, Dallas Justice: 
The Real Story of Jack Ruby and His Trial (New York; David McKay, 1964), 71. 

133 On the advice of his attorney: Final Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations, U.S. House 
of Representatives, 95th Congress, 2nd Sess. (Washington, D.C.: G.P.O., 1979), 158. Ruby had 
written a note to one of his attorneys, Joe Tonahill, stating “Joe, you should know this. My first 
lawyer Tom Howard told me to say that I shot Oswald so that Caroline and Mrs. Kennedy 
wouldn’t have to come to Dallas to testify. OK?” 

134 “a blank spot in his memory”: Belli and Carroll, Dallas Justice, 41. 

135 Jolly West tried to insinuate himself: Gene L. Usdin, letter to Jack R. Ewalt, President, American 
Psychiatric Association, Jan. 6, 1964, West Archive (“A few days after the assassination, Jolly 
phoned me to ask if I would be willing to have my name submitted to the court in Texas as a 
possible psychiatric expert”). 

136 approaching Judge Joe B. Brown: Libby Price, dictated notes from West, outline for West’s 
proposed book, A Police Man at His Elbow: Psychiatric Reflections on Jack Ruby Case, Feb. 16, 


1967, ibid. Price was West’s assistant; the relevant passage reads, “Chapter 2—How West was 


asked to set up panel of experts—psychiatrists—later that winter [1963] before Ruby trial started— 
turned down by Brown Court.” 

137 Three documents among his papers: Ibid. (third document is a second draft of chapter outline by 
West). 

138 “targets will certainly be unwitting”: “Memorandum from DDP Helms to DDCI Carter, 12/17/63,” 
Kennedy-Inouye Hearings, Appendix A, 82. 

139 “highly qualified” skills: Hubert Winston Smith, “Motion by Defense Counsel, for an Order by the 
Court...,” Texas v. Jack Ruby, no. E-4010-J, Apr. 22, 1964, 5. 

140 helping him land a teaching position: Smith was fired from his professorship at the University of 
Texas School of Law in 1965 for “disruptive” behavior and a “completely inadequate 
performance.” “There is no question that the individual is ill,” wrote a member of the school’s 
Budget and Personnel Committee in a letter to the dean (Jerre Williams, letter to W. Page Keeton, 
June 15, 1965, West Archive), yet that didn’t stop West from seeing that Smith was hired at 
Oklahoma that autumn. 

141 the preceding “forty-eight hours”: Libby Price, summary of West’s testimony to the court, June 6, 
1967, 13, ibid. 

142 there were no witnesses: West, “Report of Psychiatric Examination of Jack Ruby,” Affidavit

examined him both before and after West), Jan. 28, (approximately) Mar. 10, Apr. 30, May 1, May 
11, 1964; William R. Beavers, Apr. 28, 30, May 1, 2, 31, 1964; Werner Tuteur, July 12-15, 1965; 
Emanuel Tanay, date unavailable; Gene Usdin, Sept. 29, 1965; and Andrew Watson, Sept. 17,

12. Where Does It All Go? 


1 “I didn’t write the music”: Vincent Bugliosi with Curt Gentry, Helter Skelter (New York: Norton, 
1994), 512. 


2 In 1968, Bugliosi fell into a scandal: The information in this section is from news articles, court 
documents, and interviews with the principals involved in the cases. Especially helpful was a 140- 
page manuscript called “The Vince Bugliosi Story,” written by George Denny, the attorney who 
represented both the “milkman” (Herbert Weisel) and the “mistress” (Virginia Cardwell) in their 
civil lawsuits against Bugliosi. In a 1999 letter accompanying the manuscript, Denny explained that 
copies of it were “disseminated at the Beverly Hills Bar Association luncheon in May 1976 in 
connection with the DA’s race that year... the matters set down in this document are factually 
accurate in every respect.” Bugliosi refused to discuss both cases with me, claiming he was still 
bound by the nondisclosure agreements he’d signed as part of the settlements. That wasn’t true, as 
Denny had explained to me in 1999. He, the Weisels, and Cardwell had all deliberately violated 
their NDAs in 1976 when Bugliosi made his last run for public office, in order to prevent him from 
getting elected. They knew he’d never sue them, Denny said, because he’d never go under oath 
again about his involvement in either case. 

3 Bugliosi suspected his milkman: Bill Boyarsky and Robert A. Jones, “Former Milkman’s 
Complaint Adds to DA Race Confusion,” Los Angeles Times, Nov. 24, 1972, II-1. 

4 Weisel had left his job in 1965: Arden Farms—Personnel Record, Herbert Weisel, Employment 
Record, “Date Terminated: 6/16/65” (copy courtesy of Denny). 

5 eight months before Vincent Jr. was born: Ancestry.com, California birth record for Vincent 
Bugliosi Jr. 

6 the evidence must’ve been in Weisel’s personnel file: Anonymous letter to Weisel, postmarked 
Mar. 28, 1969 (“Dear Mr. Weisel, When I first spoke to you, you volunteered the statement that I 
could look at your records at Arden to verify that your leaving work there was unrelated to my 
wife’s pregnancy. Now that I’ve accepted your offer, you refuse to grant me permission and won’t 
even talk to me....”).

18 In depositions, Bugliosi and his wife: Denny, “Vince Bugliosi Story,” 49—50. 

19 The Weisels proved otherwise: Ibid., 49-52. 

20 Bugliosi had twice used an investigator: Ibid., 49. David Correa, an investigator for the District 
Attorney’s office, identified two requests in evidence, both by Bugliosi and both identifying Weisel 
as a material witness in a murder case; Denny’s manuscript contained photocopies of the requests. 

21 Bugliosi settled out of court: “Release Agreement,” signed by Herbert and Rose Weisel, Vincent 
and Gail Bugliosi, George Denny (for Weisels), and Stephen W. Solomon (for Bugliosis), 
notarized March 21, 1973; Denny, “Vince Bugliosi Story,” 53. 

22 He paid in cash: Denny, “Vince Bugliosi Story,” 53, 65-68; Denny included photocopies of his 
bank deposits for Bugliosi’s two cash payments as well as copies of the personal checks he wrote 
to the Weisels.

46 “may even exceed Manson’s estimate”: Bugliosi and Gentry, Helter Skelter, 615. 

47 buried or staged to look like suicides: Most infamously, a Family member named John Philip 
Haught (also known as “Christopher Jesus” and “Zero”) was found dead of a bullet wound to the 
face in a house in Venice in the presence of four Family members in November 1969. One of the 
group, Bruce Davis (later convicted in both the Hinman and Shea murders), told police Haught was 
playing a game of Russian roulette. When police checked the gun, however, all six chambers had 
been loaded and the barrel had been wiped clean of fingerprints. Nevertheless, the police declared 
the death a suicide (Bugliosi and Gentry, Helter Skelter, 619-20). In 1972, the body of nineteen- 
year-old Lauren Willett was found buried in the basement of a house occupied by Family members 
Nancy Pitman, Squeaky Fromme, and several others, in Stockton, California (the body of Willett’s 
husband, James, twenty-six, had been discovered decapitated and partially buried in nearby 
Guerneville two days earlier; both had been shot in the head). One of the women’s associates, 
Priscilla Cooper, told police that Lauren Willett had killed herself “playing Russian roulette.” This 
time the ploy didn’t work: two men (one later married to Pitman) and Pitman and Cooper went to 


prison for the murders (Bugliosi and Gentry, Helter Skelter, 622—23).

50 September 29, 1969: The information in this section is taken from original reports from police 
departments in Bishop and Culver City, California; sheriff’s departments in Inyo and Los Angeles 
Counties; Parks Department; California Highway Patrol; and the Inyo DA’s office; as well as news 
coverage; and interviews with investigators, witnesses to Tenerelli’s time in Bishop, and friends 
and family members of Tenerelli from the Los Angeles area. 

51 He was there to drive his car: The theory espoused by investigators after Tenerelli had been 
identified by medical records in late October was attributed in the Inyo Register (the paper serving 
Bishop, where the body was found) to John Preku, the chief of Bishop police, and in the Inyo 
Independent (the paper serving the county, where the car was found) to the county sheriff, Merrill 
Curtis. Both articles appeared on October 30, 1969. The Independent’s had about twice as much 
information, although, a week later, on November 6, the Register ran a second story with the 
information that had been left out of its first story, and this time, all the information was attributed 
to Sheriff Curtis, with no mention of Preku. The three articles are: “Suicide Victim Is Identified, 
Chief Reports,” Inyo Register, Oct. 30, 1969, 1; “Suicide Victim Is Identified, Says Sheriff,” Inyo 
Independent, Oct. 30, 1969, 1; “Suicide Victim Is Identified, Says Sheriff,” Inyo Register, Nov. 6,

69 DeCarlo was in Death Valley: According to trial testimony, investigation reports, and Helter 


Skelter and other books, Juan Flynn left Barker Ranch for the last time on September 29 or 30. The 
night before his departure, a “last supper” was held at which DeCarlo was present and, according to 
the testimony, made self-incriminating remarks concerning the murder of Donald “Shorty” Shea— 
but, more important, it put DeCarlo in the desert on the same day of Tenerelli’s arrival to the area 
(Juan Flynn testimony, California v. Manson et al., 11849, 11907, 12261, 12281; Jerry LeBlanc 
and Ivor Davis, 5 to Die [Los Angeles: Holloway House, 1970], 161-69. In addition, in a 1999 
taped interview with Bill Nelson, Barbara Hoyt recounted her first attempt to escape from Barker 
Ranch with Sherry Cooper on or around October 1, 1969: “Sherry made arrangements with Danny 
to meet us at bottom of Golar Wash... but we couldn’t get down there that day. Danny told us later 
that he did make it and that they were kind of sneaking up a little bit, trying to meet us and we 
couldn’t get down that time...” (Nelson interview with Hoyt, audiotape). Cooper confirmed this to 
me, explaining that they were seven hours late, so DeCarlo left without them (author interview with 


Sherry Cooper).

75 arrested for stealing a gun: Redondo Beach Police Department, Courtesy Report to Inyo County 


Sheriff’s Office, Oct. 6, 1969, Fowles Files. According to this report, two Redondo Beach residents 
filed a criminal report upon returning from a hunting trip to Death Valley, claiming that their 


parked auto had been robbed of a shotgun in the desert on October 4. After discovering the theft, 


they encountered five “hippies,” one of whom—later identified at William Rex Cole (aka Bill 
Vance)—had the gun. 

76 they’d never heard from the detectives: Among the most important witnesses who were willing to 
provide information but were never contacted: Bee Greer, Robert Denton, Dennis Cox, Frank 
Crom, and Leon Brune. They also could’ve interviewed Manson Family members, both 
incarcerated and not. One of them, Susan Atkins (who died a year after their “investigation” in 
September 2009), had told Ronnie Howard (the inmate who helped break the case) that the Family 
had killed more people then they’d been held accountable for, including “a guy in the desert—they 
can’t identify him.” According to LAPD detective Paul LePage’s notes of the jailhouse interview 
with Howard (discussed in chapter 8: “Interview of Rena Howard—Sybil Brand Institute,” Nov. 
18, 1969, 1-4, LePage personal files), the conversation between Howard and Atkins took place on 
November 2, 1969, a few days after Tenerelli’s body had been identified in Bishop. Evidently the 
news hadn’t reached Atkins yet. 

77 the six months between the reopening: The three people Jepson told me he interviewed were Billy 
Kriens (the Bishop police officer who conducted the two-day investigation of Tenerelli’s death), 
Doug Manning (the CHP officer who told me the idea that Tenerelli committed suicide was a 
“bunch of malarkey”), and Ray Seguine (whose only connection to the case was he briefly owned 
the Sportsman’s Lodge).
