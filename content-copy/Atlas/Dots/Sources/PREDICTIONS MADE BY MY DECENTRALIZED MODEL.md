1. Decentralized Medicine vs. Centralized Medicine

Kruse advocates for a decentralized model of medicine, where independent physicians work directly for patients, free from corporate or institutional oversight. These doctors prioritize personalized care, tailoring treatments to individual needs rather than adhering to standardized protocols. In contrast, centralized medicine, driven by large institutions and insurance companies, restricts physician autonomy through profit-driven algorithms, leading to less effective care that prioritizes cost-cutting over patient well-being. Decentralized doctors employ advanced, interdisciplinary approaches (e.g., spectral precision, atomic diffusion, plasmon math) to understand health at a quantum level, delivering leaner, more effective care focused on the patient-doctor relationship.

2. Photo-Bioelectric Thesis: Environmental Causes of Disease

Kruse‚Äôs core theory posits that chronic disease epidemics are driven by modern environmental mismatches, specifically exposure to blue light (from screens and artificial lighting) and non-native electromagnetic fields (nnEMF) from technologies like Wi-Fi and 5G. These factors disrupt the body‚Äôs photo-bioelectric systems, which evolved to align with natural light and electromagnetic fields. The disruptions affect mitochondrial function, circadian rhythms, and regenerative currents, leading to widespread health issues including cancer, diabetes, neurodegeneration, autoimmune disorders, and cardiovascular diseases. The thesis is grounded in biophysics and evolutionary biology, particularly the Great Oxygenation Event (GOE), which shaped heme protein functions.

---

3. Mechanisms of Disease

Kruse outlines several mechanisms through which blue light and nnEMF cause disease:

- Mitochondrial Dysfunction: Damage to heme proteins (e.g., cytochrome c oxidase, CCO) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) impairs energy production and [[Deuterium-Depleted Water]] (DDW) generation, increasing electrical resistance (√©R). This allows a 30 million volt charge in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) to dissipate, damaging local and distant tissues along neural crest migration pathways tied to pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC).
    
- Warburg Metabolism: Artificial light at night (ALAN) and indoor living stabilize HIF-1Œ± over PER2, shifting cells to glycolysis and lactate production, causing reductive stress and toxic oxygen levels.
    
- Circadian Disruption: Blue light and nnEMF destroy clock genes (PER1/PER2, Rev-Erb-Œ±/Œ≤) and alter iron‚Äôs oxidation state (+2 HbO2 to +3 metHb), decoupling metabolism from environmental light cues and promoting hypoxia.
    
- Tissue Hypoxia and Failed Regeneration: nnEMF blocks regenerative currents ([[Robert O Becker|Becker]]‚Äôs pico-to-nanoampere currents) and nitric oxide (NO) production, impairing apoptosis and stem cell function, leading to chronic degeneration.
    
- Inflammation and Entropy: Increased √©R and mtDNA damage elevate reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), driving inflammation that mimics bacterial infections due to mitochondrial endosymbiotic origins.
    
- Semiconductor Protein Degradation: Degradation of melanin and heme proteins disrupts catecholamine synthesis (e.g., dopamine), increasing methemoglobin and hypoxia, which fuels neuropsychiatric disorders.
    

---

4. Disease Predictions

Kruse predicts a surge in chronic diseases due to these mechanisms:

- Mitochondrial-Related Diseases: Increased mtDNA heteroplasmy will drive neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer‚Äôs, Parkinson‚Äôs), metabolic syndromes (e.g., diabetes, obesity), and cardiovascular issues, with younger populations showing early aging signs (fatigue, cognitive decline).
    
- Cancer: nnEMF-driven heteroplasmy and Warburg metabolism will increase incidence in high-mitochondrial-density tissues (e.g., gut, brain, heart).
    
- Diabetes: Blue light-induced insulin resistance and lactate surges will amplify type 2 diabetes, worsened by low UV-A/IR exposure.
    
- Neurodegeneration: Circadian disruption and dopamine/melanin loss will accelerate Alzheimer‚Äôs and Parkinson‚Äôs, linked to peripheral artery disease (PAD).
    
- Autoimmune Diseases: Loss of POMC and vasopressin signals will drive autoimmune conditions, requiring UV light restoration.
    
- Neuropsychiatric Disorders: Neurotransmitter imbalances and methemoglobin accumulation will fuel conditions like ADHD, autism, and pulmonary hypertension.
    
- Inflammatory Conditions: Chronic inflammation (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, IBD) will rise, often misdiagnosed as infections due to light-induced mitochondrial origins.
    

---

5. Societal and Environmental Implications

Kruse highlights broader implications of his thesis:

- Urban vs. Rural Divide: Urban areas with high nnEMF (e.g., 5G) and ALAN exposure will face higher disease rates compared to rural areas with more sunlight access, creating a socioeconomic health gradient.
    
- Younger Disease Onset: Early-life nnEMF exposure (e.g., smartphones) will accelerate mtDNA mutations, shifting diseases like diabetes and cancer to younger demographics.
    
- Therapeutic Resistance: Conventional treatments (e.g., drugs, diets) will fail without addressing light environments, as they cannot restore NAD‚Å∫, DDW, or √©R balance. Food lacks control over iron‚Äôs oxidation state, which is light-driven.
    

---

6. Proposed Solutions

Kruse suggests interventions to mitigate these issues:

- Solar Light Exposure: Daily AM sunrise light (UV-A/IR/NIR) repairs heme proteins, restores CCO, and enables proper TCA cycle function, reducing oncogenesis and hypoxia.
    
- nnEMF Reduction: Minimizing exposure to Wi-Fi, 5G, and screens lowers mtDNA damage and √©R.
    
- Photobiomodulation: Near-infrared (NIR) red light therapy or methylene blue can shift iron from +3 metHb to +2 HbO2, but timing is critical to avoid circadian conflicts.
    
- Lifestyle Adjustments: Avoiding sunscreens, sunglasses, and clothing that block natural light prevents metHb formation and supports circadian alignment.
    

---

7. Critique of Centralized Medicine

Kruse argues that centralized medicine fails to recognize light-induced mitochondrial origins of disease due to a lack of training in biophysics and quantum biology. This leads to misdiagnoses (e.g., attributing inflammation to infections) and ineffective treatments that focus on symptoms rather than addressing environmental root causes like light and nnEMF exposure.

# Thread

The view never changes if you are not the lead dog in your own life. Never settle for following. Be a leader and create a cadre of them to change the world. I'm not done with centralized fucks yet............ I'm just warming up.

And yes, I know why these nurses got the tumors they did in Boston right under Dr. Levin's nose. Why don't your centralized experts realize it?

Decentralized medicine doctors embody the spirit of a low-maintenance, high-production professional, prioritizing the patient‚Äôs needs above all else. These independent MDs work directly for themselves and their patients, free from the bureaucratic middlemen that often muddy the doctor-patient relationship in traditional systems. With no corporate overlords dictating their every move, decentralized doctors can focus on personalized care, tailoring treatments to the individual rather than adhering to rigid, one-size-fits-all protocols. We study centralized things, but MD thinks they are esoteric. We study spectral precision and atomic diffusion studies, then apply plasmon math to explain why life is the way it is. We do it all with quantum-level precision.

In contrast, algorithmic centralized MDs, tethered to the payroll of large institutions or insurance giants, often find their autonomy stifled by top-down directives and profit-driven incentives. These physicians may be forced to follow standardized algorithms prioritizing cost-cutting or institutional agendas over patient well-being, diluting the human connection at the heart of medicine. By cutting out the noise, decentralized MDs deliver a leaner, more effective approach that puts the patient, not the system, first.

**_Based on my decentralized photo-bioelectric thesis_**, the modern world‚Äôs reliance on blue light and non-native electromagnetic fields (nnEMF) for communication and indoor living sets the stage for a cascade of cellular and systemic dysfunctions that align with the rising epidemics of chronic diseases. My model emphasizes the interplay between light, mitochondrial function, water dynamics, and electrical resistance (√©R), so let‚Äôs break down the predictions step-by-step, rooted in Nature's framework.

_Core Predictions for Chronic Disease Epidemics_

- **Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Increased Heteroplasmy**
    
    ![](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/124722572/b7ad0d7b90164aaba1e0dd2718906fff/eyJ3ZWJwIjowfQ%3D%3D/1.jpeg?token-hash=GpOKnfJLL595xQ1jcko-OztSV8GVplJvuTbOvhYjpPg%3D&token-time=1751414400)
    
    - Mechanism:¬†Blue light and nnEMF damage melanopsin, mtDNA, and heme proteins (e.g., cytochromes), impairing cytochrome c oxidase and reducing [[Deuterium-Depleted Water]] (DDW) production and destroying apoptosis. The heme CCO destruction leads to dehydrated melanin, which increases electrical resistance (√©R) and allows dissipation of the 30 million volts charge into the tissue, which leaches out to destroy local and distant tissue. Why distant tissue? DC follows the path of least electrical resistance; wherever the current goes, that tissue and its photoreceptors are destroyed. This drives the heteroplasmy rate higher in that tissue. This path of destruction always has the seed of regeneration, possibly if light is used correctly. mtDNA is designed to release light to alter the oxidation state of iron while also forcing NO out of its binding site on hemoglobin in its +3 state.

        The slide above is a pictorial representation of the loss of electrical resistance pathways and how diseases manifest. You've seen it thousands of times, but now you might understand and comprehend its criticalness.
        
        The path of least resistance often follows the neural crest migration pathways of POMC. In this way, the loss of POMC is the Rosetta Stone of understanding how diseases develop and spread. ![](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/124722572/5bad89ff1a234b0eb113614870ed9dd2/e30%3D/1.png?token-hash=7YmuZ6KNYH4Hxr240BZowkow70VCgPT10TQBAX6wBFg%3D&token-time=1751414400)
        
        For example, the damage to beta and gamma MSH leads to posterior pituitary vasopressin loss, which is a key sign in the development of all autoimmune diseases. Loss of the insulation of DDW disrupts the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) electrical potential, leading to bioenergetic inefficiency. UV light restoration is critical in all autoimmune diseases, like narcolepsy. In tissues, this is a function of ultraweak UV biophotons. There is pretty good data that the VLPO neurons destroyed by the iron paramagnetic shift might be able to be regenerated from mitochondrial transfer. This paper on the two different formats of mitochondria has interesting implications for narcolepsy because of sleep physiology. Sleep is when humans should be in a more hypoxic state than during daytime, when humans are built to take full advantage of the TCA cycle and normoxia. ![](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/124722572/d6441ef1c9b849669a4eb689a3b112c8/eyJ3Ijo4MjB9/1.png?token-hash=m3FfwFqbaYE4D9jniSTG8b8_fnrx8JbiEUY6IYYr-XM%3D&token-time=1751414400)
        
        Mitochondria are known as cellular powerhouses, creating energy and vital metabolic molecules, but how they are able to split into two different species when ECT and ATP are scarce has been a mystery. In nutrient-poor situations, when mtDNA is hypoxic, mitochondria can pull off the same atavistic effect RBC showed in Becker's experiments. This atavistic split into two separate types: one concentrates on energy production (normoxic) and the other on producing essential cellular building blocks, as we would see in a fetus. Together, these allow cells to make everything they need.¬† I think the most likely reason is that mitochondria mimic their evolutionary past. One acts like a hypoxic archaea that can make building blocks during sleep when no food is eaten, and the other is a bacterium that can deal with the oxygen holocaust, so it would be ideal for making ATP during daylight hours.
        
        P5CS, or pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase, is¬†a mitochondrial enzyme crucial for getting the two mitochondrial subpopulations. The two domains of mitochondria seem to mimic the original two domains of life, bacteria and Archaea. One contains proline and ornithine biosynthesis, and the other acts with a glutamate kinase and Œ≥-glutamyl phosphate reductase activities.¬†In bacteria and lower eukaryotes, the two enzymatic domains of P5CS are completely separate enzymes, whereas in higher eukaryotes, they are combined into a single protein.¬†
        
        Human P5CS exists in two isoforms, short (P5CS. short) and long (P5CS. long), which differ by a few amino acids at the N-terminal of the glutamate 5-kinase domain.¬†
        
        - **P5CS. short** is localized in the intestine, inhibited by ornithine, and involved in arginine synthesis.¬†NO is key in arginine synthesis.
            
        - **P5CS long** is found in most tissues, involved in proline biosynthesis, and is insensitive to ornithine inhibition.¬†
            
        
        **WHY IS ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE A BIG IDEA?**¬†¬†¬†OXYGEN REQUIRES IT TO BE
        
        Below is a picture of someone struck by a lightning bolt, causing a loss of electrical resistance pattern. This pattern happens inside your body when you lose CCO competence at the IMM. Generally, the bolt of lightning pattern inside you follows your neural crest migration pathways tied to POMC biology. This should be the treasure map that decentralized clinicians use to understand the disease creation in distant tissue and the process in patients.

        Prediction:¬†Accelerated mtDNA mutation rates (5‚Äì20 times faster than nuclear DNA, further amplified by nnEMF) will increase heteroplasmy across populations where the current escapes. This manifests as a rise in mitochondrial-related diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer‚Äôs, Parkinson‚Äôs), metabolic syndromes (e.g., diabetes), obesity, apnea, and cardiovascular diseases, as cells lose their ability to process energy and manage ROS/RNS efficiently.
        
        Observable Outcome:¬†Younger populations will exhibit early signs of aging (e.g., fatigue, cognitive decline) and chronic conditions traditionally seen in older age groups, driven by widespread mtDNA damage from constant nnEMF exposure (e.g., Wi-Fi, 5G, screens).
        
- **Warburg Metabolism and Reductive Stress**
    
    Mechanism:¬†The disruption of solar EMF (UV-A/IR) by indoor living and ALAN (artificial light at night) stabilizes HIF-1Œ± over PER2, shifting cellular metabolism toward glycolysis and lactate production (Warburg shift). This increases NADH/NAD‚Å∫ ratios, causing reductive stress and rendering oxygen toxic due to impaired electron flow across a damaged IMM. Review this thread to review the lessons of previous blogs. I have taught savages how your disease is born. [HYPERLINK](https://x.com/DrJackKruse/status/1613298172801044482)
    
    Prediction:¬†Chronic diseases are always characterized by Warburg-like metabolism in the electrically damaged tissues, and diseases will manifest from the mist and will surge, including cancer (e.g., increased glucose uptake visible on FDG-PET), atherosclerosis (plaque glycolysis), and neurological conditions (e.g., schizophrenia with elevated lactate). Rapid glycolysis will fuel aberrant cell growth called [[atavism]], and oxygen creates more oxygen radicals that should not be present. This amplifies inflammation, which amplifies disease progression. Getting the injured body part or organ into the sun creates NO locally to slow ATP production and decrease energy production to match the tissue level atavism. This will induce a relative pseudohypoxia. The UV and IR light combination will properly repair the heme proteins and melanin to allow proper quantized tissue mechanics to return, lowering the chance of oncogenesis or disease phenotype transition from the spreading of electrical damage.
    
    Observable Outcome:¬†Higher cancer incidence, particularly in tissues with high mitochondrial density (e.g., gut, brain, heart), alongside metabolic diseases like obesity and insulin resistance, as blue light/nnEMF elevates blood sugar and insulin while depleting NAD‚Å∫. The level of oxygenation is the key to the disease one gets.
    
- **Circadian Disruption and Molecular Clock Chaos**
    
    Mechanism:¬†Blue light liberates retinaldehyde from opsins, destroying PER1/PER2 and nuclear HEME circadian receptors (Rev-Erb-Œ±/Œ≤), while nnEMF accelerates mtDNA timing errors. Light can destroy heme signaling by changing iron's oxidation state from +2Hb02, which is oxygen-friendly, to +3 metHb, which cannot bind oxygen. Instead, it binds NO, and your tissues become hypoxic on a relative basis. This mimics what happened in the GOE when oxygen tensions rose from 1% to 21%. The NO system is an old system that was critical in use when oxygen was a toxin during the GOE.
    
    Blue light also destroys CCO dynamics simultaneously, because it is a heme protein that makes DDW and controls apoptosis. DDW insulates tissues from the 30 million volt field in the IMM, and if something goes awry, apoptosis is designed to eliminate the bad engine to prevent tissue damage. Apoptosis, however, requires that the circadian mechanism be functional to operate well. There is bad news on this front because our nuclear clock genes are heme-based. The destruction ot Rev Erb alpha and beta disrupts the quantum periodicity of cellular clocks in this tissue, decoupling energy metabolism from environmental light cues (below). This is how every disease begins in humans today. This is why food cannot fix chronic diseases.

        Prediction:¬†Circadian misalignment will drive epidemics of sleep disorders, mood disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety), and hormonal imbalances (e.g., leptin/melatonin dysregulation). Most of these systems have other heme proteins as oxygen environment gatekeepers. Heme proteins evolved because of the oxygen holocaust event, which first developed in the Great Oxygenation Event 2.4 billion years ago. Heme proteins are a protection scheme from the rise of oxygen in our environment. Loss of PER2-mediated oxygen optimization exacerbates hypoxia-related diseases, such as cardiac failure, stroke, and PAD.
        
    - Observable Outcome:¬†Increased prevalence of insomnia, seasonal affective disorder (SAD), cardiometabolic diseases, high BP, infertility, especially in populations with high screen time and who minimize sunlight exposure (e.g., office workers, night-shift workers). Light, that is not solar, is Nature‚Äôs cruel blade. Blind folks dodge cancer‚Äôs claw (incidence -20%, per studies), while shift workers and bright-street dwellers bleed higher risk (breast cancer +38%, per 2018 meta-analyses). Why? Light flips iron‚Äôs oxidation state, and NO binds to Hb, making it hypoxic in a normoxic environment. This makes cells dedifferentiate because it causes them to lose their polarization. That is why oncogenesis happens in modern humans.

        **Tissue Hypoxia and Failed Regeneration = a prescription for chronic disease epidemics.**
        
        Mechanism:¬†nnEMF and blue light block Becker‚Äôs regenerative pico-to-nanoampere current by impairing heme protein function by blocking DDW production from metabolism, while also degrading our apoptosis mechanism. This does not allow us to insulate ourselves from the 30 million volts field in the IMM that Nick Lane told us about in Power, Sex, and Suicide, and when apoptosis breaks you lose control over your own QA system because you cannot suicide bad engines that cannot use the TCA cycle and oxygen. This is how heteroplasmy rises. nnEMF also destroys local NO radicals, preventing stem cell dedifferentiation. NO controls the stem cell depots of man, making those stem cells hypoxic.
        
        Lowered NAD+ is usually linked to a relative pseudohypoxia (Sinclair 2013) in tissue and results from low recycling of NAD‚Å∫ due to the IMM damage. This injury is associated with intracellular dehydration, which triggers vasopressin release at the hypothalamus and activation of the VP-ISR-GDF15 axis (you pee a lot at night), conserving water but increasing √©R and entropy. Why? When melanin on your interior surfaces is dehydrated, it becomes more electrically conductive. That field on the IMM can travel far and wide, causing brownouts and burnouts in far-away places. This is how diseases begin and germinate if the Becker currents are not reestablished daily by AM and PM solar signaling.
        
        AM sunrise red light is the default switch we must see to repair heme proteins like CCO, so we can use the TCA cycle. If CCO is damaged, you cannot use the TCA cycle even if you eat like a carnivore. No one believed me when I said it 15 years ago.

        Prediction:¬†Regenerative capacity will decline, leading to chronic degenerative diseases (e.g., osteoarthritis, retinopathy) and poor wound healing. Tissue hypoxia will amplify organ failure (e.g., kidney, liver) and inflammatory conditions (e.g., sarcoidosis, autoimmune diseases).
        
        Observable Outcome:¬†Rising rates of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, and fibrosis, particularly in urban populations exposed to nnEMF and devoid of UV-A/NIR/IRA red light for NO release and stem cell activation to repair tissues. Injuries require prolonged hypoxia to repair the tissues. This is why NO in wounds are critical.
        
- **Inflammation and Entropy Surge**
    
    - Mechanism:¬†Elevated √©R from dehydrated melanin pathways (POMC migration of neural crest acts like a wire) and damaged mtDNA increases ROS/RNS, driving inflammation and molecular damage. The dissipative electrical energy loss from mtDNA short circuiting causes entropy to rise like a wave of inflammation spreading in tissues, mimicking bacterial infection-like cascades due to mitochondrial endosymbiotic origins. This is why every single human disease appears to have infectious causes. Many people misread this signal in centralized medicine.
        
    - The signal exists because Becker's injury repair stimulus requires active apoptosis (via the heme CCO protein) to eliminate bad engines and stop tissue electrical resistance loss. This is how the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways operate for tissue mtDNA feedback. This [HYPERLINK](https://x.com/DrJackKruse/status/1614379188462436353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1614379188462436353%7Ctwgr%5Eafd05cd042c6d2ec166939d560968012d582f76f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fforum.jackkruse.com%2Fthreads%2Fmitochondrial-thermodynamics-diy-lesson-thread.27408%2F) gets into all the details. When the Dr. Nick Jikomes podcast comes out with me as a guest, you'll have much to chew on with this blog entry.
        
    - Prediction:¬†Chronic inflammatory diseases, such as autoimmune conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, IBD) and ‚Äúsilent‚Äù inflammation-driven conditions (e.g., atherosclerosis, Alzheimer‚Äôs), will dominate. Due to their photo-bioelectrical mitochondrial roots, these diseases will be misdiagnosed as infections or idiopathic. Centralized MDs have no idea what they are looking at because none of them were taught the biophysics in this blog. You'll get better advice from the Colombian drug cartel.
        
    - Observable Outcome:¬†A spike in autoimmune disorders and chronic fatigue syndrome, with diagnostic confusion as standard tests fail to pinpoint light-induced mitochondrial origins. All autoimmune conditions begin this way. No exceptions exist in my model. Apoptosis is an all-or-none process in human cells.
        
- **Semiconductor Protein Degradation**
    
    - Mechanism:¬†Blue light/nnEMF degrades melanin and heme proteins, disrupting their semiconductive properties. This impairs catecholamine synthesis because melanin is degraded in hypoxic states as the oxidation state of iron is changed by the light-induced injuries. (e.g., dopamine, adrenaline)
        
    - This chain of events raises methemoglobin levels, blocking oxygen delivery to tissues and stimulating atavistic cell changes to prepare the damaged tissue for regenerative currents. Those currents require LIGHT to become active. The light is from mtDNA inside of you, not from the sun. Without a specific ultraweak UV biphoton stimulus, light cannot flip the "paramagnetic light switch" that turns Becker's regenerative currents back on and resolves the tissue hypoxia event. This is when iron goes from its +3 state in metHb to its +2 state in HbO2, and NO unbinds from metHb to become Hb02, as the slide shows below.

        Prediction:¬†Neurotransmitter imbalances manifest rapidly in this scenario and will fuel neuropsychiatric disorders due to electrical resistance damage in neural and vascular networks once CCO is damaged (e.g., ADHD, autism). If the diurnal light stimulus does not reintroduce the regenerative currents, the process of electrical damage spreads.![](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/124722572/cdacb15351964fb7b17f9335679bede8/eyJ3Ijo4MjB9/1.png?token-hash=U9GQ-8rYnTxwaSDXzwMJM3B88qObiL6j12TEtl1CLq0%3D&token-time=1751414400)
        
        As this happens, methemoglobin accumulation begins in the damaged area, increasing hypoxia-related conditions (e.g., cyanosis, pulmonary hypertension). Lack of melanin rehydration will exacerbate all these diseases. The only way to get Becker's current is to create hydrated melanin to get the one trillionth of one ampere current that cells need for differentiation and healing.
        
        Observable Outcome:¬†Epidemics of mental health crises in children (screen exposure) and retinal pigmentosa-like conditions in adults, alongside rising unexplained hypoxia cases (CVD/MI), may become reversible with methylene blue or NIR red light therapy at the proper time. Timing is critical for the clinician to assess. If there is a comorbid circadian problem, use of MB is contraindicated. MB main job of MB is to change +3 MetHb to +2 Hb02. Not understanding this process could be catastrophic for the patient.
        

**Broader Societal and Environmental Implications**

- Urban vs. Rural Divide:¬†Chronic disease rates will be higher in urban areas with dense nnEMF (e.g., 5G networks) and ALAN exposure compared to rural areas with more sunlight access, highlighting a socioeconomic gradient in health outcomes. nnEMF and light prevent the +2 Hb02 state and favor the MetHb +3 state. Social conventions for suncreams, drugs, clothing, contacts, and sunglasses will increase disease risk because they favor methemoglobin formation.
    
- Age of Onset:¬†Diseases like diabetes, dementia, and cancer will shift to younger demographics, reflecting accelerated epigenetic and mtDNA damage from early-life nnEMF exposure (e.g., smartphones, tablets). The effect is cumulative and logrhythmic because mtDNA mutates much faster than centralized medicine understands. This is why diseases have non-linear aspects in regions. Children born with jaundice have massive amplification of heteroplasmy and methylation problems in tissues as a result of faulty iron oxidation states. No diet or pill changes this state. No diet can alter the oxidation state of iron.
    
- Therapeutic Resistance:¬†Standard treatments (e.g., antioxidants, glucose-lowering drugs, diets) will fail without addressing the light environment and, in many cases, worsen the disease, as they don‚Äôt restore NAD‚Å∫, DDW, or √©R balance. This electrical resistance pattern is formed from the AMO physics in the cell. The oxidation state of iron is a proxy for the quantization of metabolism. This determines how energy is stored at the atomic level in cells. This necessitates solar treatment daily or photobiomodulation (e.g., NIR red light) with nnEMF mitigation. Maintenance of this is mandatory day and night. This determines the electrical resistance in cells. Where it drops is where the disease phenotype expands.
    

**Specific Disease Examples**

- Cancer:¬†nnEMF-driven heteroplasmy and Warburg shift will increase incidence, especially in nnEMF-exposed tissues (e.g., brain tumors from cell phones, skin cancers from blue light). This is linked 100% to the oxidation state of heme proteins. Few people realize how many key proteins are heme proteins. That includes your centralized MDs.
    
- Diabetes:¬†Blue light-induced insulin resistance is associated with high blood glucose and lactate surges, which amplify type 2 diabetes diseases because of a loss of superoxide pulse due to the hypoxic state at the mtDNA levels. This is worsened by indoor living associated with low UV-A/IR/NIR exposure. All of this is tied to iron's oxidation state. This also affects quantum tunneling on the IMM because there are FeS couples at this location. The more iron is kept in the +3 state, the less ECT operates properly.

All these diseases are associated with PAD because of the state of iron oxidation in the vessels.
    
    Cardiovascular Disease:¬†Hypoxia and √©R from poor PER2/HIF-1 balance will drive heart failure and atherosclerosis, exacerbated by ALAN/nnEMF toxicity.![](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/124722572/1d1cfe47af304e4393a567c8c1f51f85/e30%3D/1.png?token-hash=TNsV0dBI_OofgiKz6QCW4RdZg-j_5XyE2_RNdshBK3A%3D&token-time=1751414400)
    

**SUMMARY**

The decentralized¬†model predicts that the modern world‚Äôs blue light and nnEMF saturation fundamentally disrupt the photo-bioelectric harmony that has evolved over billions of years, from the Great Oxygenation Event to the Cambrian Explosion. Chronic disease epidemics like cancer, diabetes, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular disease emerge as hallmarks of this light mismatch, driven by mitochondrial chaos, water dysregulation, and circadian collapse. The data should show a clear correlation between nnEMF/ALAN exposure levels and disease prevalence, which is linked to how iron is forced into its +3 oxidation state, with sunlight-deprived populations bearing the brunt.

Mitigation requires a radical shift toward solar EMF restoration in AM light, including (UV-A/IR/NIR) and a massive sustained nnEMF reduction. This thesis aligns strongly with my emphasis on light as the primary driver of food in all chronic diseases. Food has no physical control over the oxidation state of iron. Light drives iron shift from the metHb +3 state to the Hb02 state, so the TCA cycle and oxygen are no longer toxic for cells.

This decentralized thesis covers everything you see in the world today. Remember this when centralized medicine says it remains stumped about your condition. **_You no longer should be._**![](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/124722572/fad8a839ad534eeab480c3506522f5ba/eyJ3ZWJwIjowfQ%3D%3D/1.jpeg?token-hash=lLzf_Zr_fj8BCvzZcBMpdNDpiiT4BRDasY59Zrqu34A%3D&token-time=1751414400)
