# Summary of the Overall Episode

Owens frames her investigation as a counter-narrative to the French mainstream media, which she accuses of suppressing truth through smears and controlled storytelling. The episode combines detailed analysis of media portrayals, family photo discrepancies, and Macron’s personal history, interspersed with sponsor promotions and audience engagement.

## Critique of Brigitte’s Media Narrative

Owens takes a break from darker allegations (e.g., pedophilia) to debunk the mainstream media’s portrayal of Brigitte as a "hot, bold" figure who defied her Catholic upbringing. She reads verbatim from past publications, describing Brigitte at 14-15 swapping her school uniform for miniskirts, dancing wildly, and flirting as an "inveterate party girl." These accounts, she argues, were crafted to romanticize her relationship with a 14-year-old Emmanuel Macron, portraying him as lucky to attract such a charismatic teacher. Quotes from alleged colleagues and students (e.g., Brigitte’s "irresistible legs" and allure) are presented as fabricated to soften public perception of the age gap and power dynamic.

## Biographical Scrutiny and Photo Controversies

The episode pivots to the 2018 official biography Brigitte Macron: La Femme Libre by Mayel Brun, which Owens criticizes for lacking childhood or young mother photos, with the earliest image from 1993 showing Brigitte as a 40-year-old teacher. Similarly, Virginie Linhard’s documentary Brigitte Macron: Un Roman Français, aired on government-owned France 3, is faulted for relying on photos from 1986 onward, omitting 23 crucial early years (e.g., marriage, motherhood). Linhard’s own comments about facing a "thick wall of silence" from Brigitte’s chief of staff, Pierre-Olivier Costa, and the control exerted by Mimi Marchand’s Best Image agency, are cited as evidence of suppression. Two childhood photos—a first communion image resembling daughter Tiphaine and a family photo introducing an unaccounted-for brother, Jean-Michel Trogneux—are flagged as explosive. The communion photo’s authenticity is questioned due to alleged recoloring (later retracted by Owens), while the family photo sparks speculation about Jean-Michel and his son Jean-Jacques, who resembles Macron.André-Louis Auzière’s MysteryOwens labels André-Louis Auzière, Brigitte’s alleged husband of 32 years, as the "French Republic’s best-kept secret." She notes the sole Wikipedia photo was misidentified by politician François Ruffin as a teacher, Mr. Hugo, fueling public suspicion. The lack of photos from Brigitte’s married life with Auzière (died 2019) is presented as a glaring omission.

## Emmanuel Macron’s Elusive Past

The focus shifts to Macron’s biography, described by Xavier Poussard as a "mystery." Classmates recall him as a loner with no known friends or vacation details, and early life photos are scarce, starting at age 12 with his baptism. His autobiography Revolution devotes minimal space to family (e.g., five pages on his grandmother, one on parents), contrasting with detailed mentions of Brigitte’s children. Family estrangement is evident, with brother Laurent denying closeness and cousin Nicole rarely seeing sister Estelle. Unauthorized 2017 Paris Match photos of a young Macron, uncredited and never reused, add to the enigma.

## Regional and Linguistic Anomalies

Owens highlights Macron’s disconnect from Amiens, with former mayor Gilles de Robien suggesting he’s from Le Touquet, and his absence from the 2018 Battle of Amiens centenary. A 2018 Andorra visit gaffe—claiming great-grandparents spoke a non-existent language "Penan"—is cited as evidence of a fabricated heritage, linked to his maternal roots in Bagnères-de-Bigorre.

## Visual Evidence and Speculation

Side-by-side photos of Jean-Jacques Trogneux and Macron are teased, hinting at a possible identity overlap. Owens urges viewers not to trust their eyes, mocking media denials, and teases future episodes on Macron’s grandparents and parents’ psychiatric work, possibly tied to government programs like MK Ultra.Sponsorships and Audience InteractionPromotions for Pre-Born (abortion pill reversal), Field of Greens (health supplement), and American Financing (debt relief) interrupt the narrative, reflecting Owens’ independent funding model. Audience comments range from support to off-topic queries (e.g., clothing sources, Ryan Reynolds), with Owens engaging humorously, reinforcing her persona as a relatable, faith-driven investigator.

## Overall Narrative

The episode expands Owens’ conspiracy theory, alleging the Macrons’ lives are fabricated to hide unknown truths. Brigitte’s "pinup" image and Macron’s elusive past are dissected through photo absences and inconsistent accounts, with legal letters from the Macrons dodging substantive denials. The introduction of Jean-Michel Trogneux and Jean-Jacques suggests a potential identity swap, while Macron’s regional and linguistic errors fuel doubts. Owens portrays this as a battle against a controlled narrative, blending investigative zeal with provocative speculation, supported by her audience’s enthusiasm.

well we are trending in France I can tell you 
that remarkably we are not getting any Fair   coverage from their mainstream media apparatus

false identity I haven't any yet met any claims  

01:00
about a false identity weird what do they 
know that we don't know I mean it just  

01:05

welcome back to our series becoming

01:12
bit all right guys I have a fun one for you 
today we're taking a break from the uh very  

01:33
dark world of Brit we we did not even cover 
all of the pedophile stories but we're just   going to take a a brief break from that one of 
the biggest mainstream media lies okay is that  

01:42
the rumors surrounding Brit were developed by 
farri conspiracy theorists they keep throwing  

01:48
that word out it's a conspiracy it's a conspiracy 
as though somebody put together a thread on Reddit  

01:53
or on the dark web and that's the reason why 
people just started believing everything that   is not true it could not be further from the truth 
so I'm going to recap for you what actually went  

02:03
down in France it's important to know this the 
press as we mentioned yesterday intentionally   spun a tale of an irresistibly hot and bold Brit 
macron who was constantly pushing back against  

02:15
the Conformity of her stale Catholic upbringing 
all throughout her life okay I'm actually going   to read you verbatim some of the published lines 
from that time because it is funny it's actually  

02:26
funny to read how much the mainstream media just 
lies to us all the time okay quote around the age  

02:33
of 14 or 15 Brit gets Bolder she swaps her navy 
blue uniform from the auster Sacred Heart School  

02:41

discipline here's another one she loves to dance  

02:55
at the surprise parties of the time she wears 
tight miniskirts and between two glass glasses  

03:00
of whiskey and Coke and wild rock and roll songs 
she dares to flirt behind the curtains just just  

03:06
imagine what is what is coming into your mind 
as I read these Publications about her growing   up okay here's another one describing brigit as a 
quote inveterate party girl in an ultra small Kilt  

03:19
who was into rock dancing to the music of John 
Lee Hooker until dawn a rather hectic adolescent  

03:25
the opposite of The Quiet Emanuel another writer 
wrote quote the youngest of the trogo family has  

03:31
always struck a chord with the public with her 
contagious Good Humor her taste for partying and  

03:37
her often funny downto Earth way of speaking again 
of course the goal of all of that was to soften  

03:44
her for having seduced a 14-year-old Emanuel 
macron right rather we're supposed to imagine  

03:51
in our minds that macron had simply hit the 
jackpot right he fulfilled the fantasy of every  

03:57
boy his age because he got to sleep with that hot 
teacher okay and they reinforced this narrative  

04:04
by inserting sometimes Anonymous quotes from 
former colleagues of Brit and alleged classmates  

04:11
of Emanuel again what I'm about to read to you 
are real quotes that were published in the main  

04:16
the mainstream press about Brit's teaching days 
okay quote Brit's class can't believe that the  

04:23
French teacher is celebrating her 40th birthday 
today she looks so young in her short skirt and  

04:30
Casual manner to capture the attention of the most 
dissipated the teacher has another less academic  

04:37
asset her legs showcased in tiny skirts Bri didn't 
wait to become the first lady to take great care  

04:45
of her appearance quote she was a pleasure to 
look at not just listen to always with perfect  

04:52
hairdressing with makeup and perfumed one student 
recalls the boys are seduced the girls take her  

04:59
as a role model all the high school students were 
in love with her says frederique from emanuel's  

05:06
class and from her very vocal daughter tifone the 
only child that seems to really defend RIT macron  

05:14
she included this quote when I was a child I was 
even jealous of all the students who wrote to  

05:19
her or called her at home then there is another 
teacher who spoke and went a little bit further  

05:26
they said quote rajit arrived at La prid wearing 
mini ters that's like um a mini skirt and with a  

05:34
with a jacket right a sports coat beautiful a 
pinup one student stresses we were all in love  

05:43
with her well you guys the mainstream media says 
it's true I guess it's case closed we might as  

05:48
well stop this investigation what do you want 
hottie hottie with a body man I sure hope I   look like whatever that was at the age of 40 with 
people drooling over themselves but it didn't stop  

06:01
there the case wasn't really closed because in 
2018 okay what happens next is a woman named mayel  

06:06
Brun she was then the head of the celebrities 
department at the magazine closer published the  

06:13
quote unquote unofficial biography pardon official 
biography of Brit mcon which was entitled Brit  

06:20
mcon La froni okay which means in English the 
freed woman look at that cover wow she's free  

06:27
amazing look at that face she's Happ happy she's 
glowing and it was essentially really a book that  

06:33
was just a regurgitation or rather a compilation 
of everything that I just said to you everything   that had already been published and I'll tell you 
why this was immediately considered a departure  

06:43
from previous authorized biographies of a first 
lady or president and that's because there was  

06:48
absolutely no pictures provided of brigit mccrone 
as a child and there were no pictures provided of  

06:54
her as a young mother in fact the earliest picture 
Okay in this Auto authorized biography was from  

07:01
1993 when Brit was already teaching by that time 
at the Providence school so here it is this is the  

07:08
earliest photo that they included wait a second 
okay so the caption beneath that photo read RIT  

07:17
oier is 40 she's married she's the mother of three 
she's quite appreciated at the high school where  

07:22
she teaches she's about to make the encounter that 
will cause an upheaval we cause an upheaval of her  

07:28
life okay so they just went ahead and decided 
to erase the first 40 years in this uh official  

07:37
biography then six months later in June of 2018 
a Woman by the name of uh virgin leanard who  

07:46
normally focused on creating documentaries about 
World War II and the Holocaust essentially turned  

07:52
the book a biography of Brit into a documentary 
which was entitled Brit mcon un Roman France which  

08:00
is just means uh a French novel and that was 
released on the France 3 Channel now I should  

08:06
mention to you that this is a government-owned 
channel okay it was created in 1969 by the Office   of the President this is like PBS BBC okay we 
are not in conspiracy land this is a reputable  

08:20
woman Virginia leanard who makes documentaries and 
of course documentaries are supposed to include   a ton of photos think about whatever you were 
watching when you were coming up for me maybe  

08:30
Britney Spears Christina aguiler a documentaries 
just filled with photos when you are watching this  

08:35
and you're seeing their siblings and you're 
seeing them at Disney World and you're seeing   them you know doing whatever was normal for the 
time that they were growing up a Michael Jackson  

08:43
documentary right tons of photos and siblings 
and by the way I want to be clear virin linhard  

08:49
did have tons of photos just you know almost all 
of them again from Brit teaching days beginning  

08:55
in 1986 in strawberg and ending in Paris in 2015 
so I'm going to show you the photos that were in  

09:03
this documentary uh first just showing you this 
collage actually of all of the photos there you  

09:11
have it um and Mark I don't know if you to take 
me out of that so they can see the full thing wait  

09:16
okay what's going on here because I was reliably 
informed that brigit oier was a hot sexy pinup  

09:24
girl with irresistible legs who wore miniskirts 
the kind of woman that the the boys just couldn't  

09:30
look away from what is I don't know guy fellas 
should I check the chat here are you guys DW guys  

09:37
is it is it getting nasty in the chat because I'm 
not seeing it I am just not seeing that teacher  

09:44

strangely to be wearing a scarf in a lot of these  

09:50

her neck that's kind of weird here I'll give  

09:55
you guys some close-ups of that maybe maybe you

there's going to be some sexy pinup girl where's   the next one ah there it is nope there it is not 
Skyler are you only Pi these are the ones from the  

10:25
documentary maybe my producer made a mistake 
what okay I don't know I don't know where the   pinup girl is I'm sorry guys I I just I feel like 
I've let you down anyways Virginia linhard the  

10:36
documentary maker like I said is well respected so 
surely she must have tried to get many more photos  

10:43
before Brit's teaching years if she's not a fraud 
uh then that would have been the first thing she  

10:48
would have tried to do interestingly enough she 
spoke out regarding just how difficult it was for  

10:55
her to make the documentary she said and I quote 
it's difficult to investigate brigit macron much  

11:02
more than I imagined on the substance on the form 
on everything as soon as I started making contacts  

11:10
I was summoned by Pierre Olivier Costa bit's chief 
of staff and Tristan brome rit's other Chief of  

11:17
Staff it was almost like a police interrogation 
what do I want to show who will I be interviewing  

11:24
I made a list of people that I wanted to meet but 
I could not apply that list the interviewees apart  

11:31
from her former students all had the authorization 
of the Alise Palace and were very careful about  

11:38
what they said there is a thick wall of Silence 
the level of control and checking is well quite  

11:44
astounding my documentary is a 90minut very 
personal portrait for it I needed photographs  

11:53
of young Brit mcon small children that would show 
an itinerary not those approved by by Best Image  

12:00
agency what won't be released is anything to do 
with her former life it's a total blackout end  

12:08
quote Oh best image agency now didn't we just 
go over that um yesterday that's Mimi's agency  

12:14
that was authorizing the photos that were allowed 
to go out so apparently Mimi's agency authorized   the photos that could go out for this documentary 
as well now virgini linhard did however receive  

12:26
two photos from bit's alleged child Ood one the 
public was told was from Brit then trogo would  

12:34
have been her last name her first communion 
I'm going to show you that photo here it is  

12:39
and another photo now Infamous photo of the 
entire trogo family allegedly taken about a  

12:46
year after brigit's birth okay that is the full 
trno family photo which we will come back to so  

12:55
now really all that was missing from that photo of 
her communion until the school photos which appear  

13:02
in 1986 was 23 years of Brit's life the most 
crucial years of her life you know like I don't  

13:09
know her being a teenager her getting married at 
21 her allegedly having three babies her getting  

13:16
married to a banker named Andre Louise oier who 
was her husband of 32 years like I don't know  

13:22
did you do do people not take photos of them and 
their husbands in France I don't know Virginia  

13:29
linhard actually referred to Andre Lise oier 
reit's alleged husband of 32 years as the French  

13:37
Republic's best kept secret and certainly you guys 
it appeared that way because at the time that the  

13:43
documentary was released there was only one photo 
that was available of her ex-husband that had even  

13:50
made its way onto Wikipedia as her ex-husband 
there it is Andre Luiz oier and you can see it  

13:56
has his date of birth and it has his date of death 
and it has the dates that they were married from   1974 to 2006 all of that is correct except for 
the photo itself yeah could you pull that up again  

14:07
that photo it turned out was not actually Andre 
Luiz oier because um a former student who had gone  

14:14
on to become a politician his name is Francois 
ruffen also went to Providence school and he came  

14:19
out and said that's not Andre louiz oier that's Mr 
Hugo a teacher at the school oopsies NH whatever  

14:29
but I got to tell you that oopsie did make the 
public think what what's going on here man this is   kind of getting weird it's a little weird okay and 
I have to tell you guys there was some immediate  

14:38
feedback from the public some early musings if 
you will about the two photos too which had been  

14:45
released from bit's alleged childhood foremost 
a communion photo caused a bit of a stir because  

14:52
many felt that it was a Dead Ringer that photo not 
of first lady brijit mccrone who was side by side  

14:59
here uh bit oier and her alleged communion photo 
they didn't feel like that was strong but they  

15:05
did feel that it was a dead ringer for her very 
chatty daughter ton they thought that that looks  

15:13
like ton okay and um like I said she was the only 
daughter the only uh s uh child of brigit that was  

15:22
willing to participate in the documentary she was 
willing to speak to Virgin for like an hour and um  

15:29
like I said it doesn't help that best image the 
photo agency uh had supplied the image people  

15:35
were wondering and I include myself in this was 
it perhaps edited no Mimi as we learn later on  

15:44
has been accused of a lot of forgery and stuff and 
all sorts of crimes man you got to look into Mimi   Maran so it's not like totally crazy to wonder 
if maybe she's being used because she does play  

15:55
around a bit and she's willing to do crimes you 
know so yeah it was uh it was in fact my musings  

16:02
about that was one of the areas of nitpick one 
of the areas that the macron's had included when  

16:09
they initially sent me the first strongly worded 
letter because I had claimed on a show dating back  

16:15
to March of last year that the photo was recolored 
I looked at it and I said that photo looks too new  

16:21
it looks like it's it's recolored now having and 
I was just getting into this bizarre story and so  

16:27
I was just inves investigating asking questions 
reading other people's investigations now I'm a  

16:33
lot deeper on the facts and I now know for a 
fact that that photo was not recolored okay  

16:40
similarly at the beginning when I was trying 
to understand this case I I had asked Xavier   pussard about the theory which a lot of people 
were wondering which was did the real brit trno  

16:51
die when she was a child and did perhaps bri 
mcon take her identity again that was a that  

16:59
was floating around the internet and I now know 
for a fact that no she did not die when she was  

17:04
a child so let's go back actually and take a look 
at their first carefully worded legal letter to  

17:11
me this is their repeat strategy I'm going to keep 
reminding you of this the way that they sue people   the way that they go after people in court is they 
ignore the substance of the claims substance being  

17:21
was current first lady brigit macron born 
a biological male it's a simple yes or no  

17:29
question and instead of attacking that they 
wait for people to make a mistake as they try  

17:34
to Garner the answer and of course mistakes will 
be made of course you could say this photo is   recolored and they go Boop go after her go after 
her she suspect saying that bit trno di a child  

17:44
go after her so this is the uh the legal letter 
we'll show you that they wrote you're discredit  

17:52
you're discrediting of these photos is not only 
without Merit but also internally inconsistent in  

17:58
your episode on March 11th and March 13th and June 
17th you claim that the first communion photo is  

18:04
an altered image of to phone oier however in your 
August 30 podcast you agreed with pussard that  

18:12
the photo depicts the real prit trugo before she 
passed away at a young age another falsehood now  

18:20
I want to be very clear Xavier pussard has never 
said that briet trno passed away at a young age  

18:25
but I may have asked him the question and was 
speculating about whether not she passed away   which they claim is another falsehood then they 
say both hypotheses could not be further from the  

18:35
truth more you alleged that the first communion 
photo had been debunked repeatedly and that the  

18:41
Press now states its attribution to Mrs macron 
was a mistake but you have not cited any Outlets  

18:47
or articles retracting the photo surely you would 
provide this devastating proof If you had it but   you do not okay doing a little dance there why do 
they not just simply State who who the person in  

18:59
the commun photo is why not just say say plainly 
if you're going to write a legal letter Candice   the person in this commun photo is not tone oier 
and the photo is not recolored and it is in fact  

19:12
first lady brijit mccrone they don't do that they 
never do that why not also simply State what the  

19:17
truth is rather than saying that the hypotheses 
are far from the truth so of course now we're  

19:24
like a year on I'm now armed with a much Fuller 
picture of what happened what what the truth might   really be and so my legal team as you remember 
included a very straightforward yes or no  

19:34
question back to them back to the couple in good 
faith regarding the girl in the communion photo   I rewrote this number four is the little girl 
pictured in the communion photograph allegedly  

19:45
from 1963 the brijit mcon that is currently 
married to president mcon you guys know what  

19:52
happens next no response no response they're angry 
you said it was recolored you said Brit trug no  

19:58
had died when she was a child that's defamation 
that's AFF information but we can't tell you  

20:06
what the truth is They Knew by then in terms of 
how specific my questions were getting they knew  

20:12
that I was on to them that I had worked through 
the investigation that I had arrived at more   correct conclusions that I was doing less musing 
okay not for a single second did we believe that  

20:21
they were going to answer our questions and they 
have not yet they just send us more letters and   more ridiculous things where they don't assert 
what the truth actually is now regarding the  

20:31
second photo of Brit's alleged childhood which the 
documentary presented let's take a look at it so  

20:36
you can understand what was so explosive about 
it uh this uh full family trogo uh family trno  

20:43
photo um of them in Aman okay observations again 
were immediately made by the public people are  

20:49
allowed to think they are allowed to have thoughts 
they are allowed to ask questions okay first and  

20:55
foremost people thought they were being told that 
b is this little girl in the lap of her mother  

21:01
sitting here in the front but the public just 
quickly taking a glance here thought wait a second  

21:09
bit looks more like that little boy on the far 
left and wait a second who is that little boy in  

21:15
the far left he's completely unaccounted for thus 
far okay leading up to this moment despite so much  

21:22
press surrounding brigit her life her married life 
her being a teacher despite entire genealogical  

21:30
websites that were dedicated to her family there 
was no mention on these genealogical websites or  

21:36
in the Press of the boy on the far left okay so 
that became the dog that wasn't barking okay for  

21:44
clarity there had been only one brother that was 
publicly accounted for Brit's older brother we'll  

21:49
show you a picture again he is the one standing 
in the back that is Jean Claude and the interested  

21:56
public were now being introduced suddenly to a 
second mysterious brother and they would find out  

22:01
that his name was Jean Michelle trog no going to 
take a brief pause here before I bring in Emanuel  

22:10
marron's strange story first just to throw it 
to one of our amazing sponsors pre-born because

pill reversal treatment which provides women with   a second opportunity to choose is bringing babies

24:06
greens.com cod Candice all right guys we're just 
um warming up again feels like we're falling down  

24:13
a hole I'm not sure why it's weird and again these 
are all these are all mainstream journalists so I  

24:18
don't know what I did wrong here by presenting it 
to the world so that they could see that something   weird has been going on in France for quite 
some time and rather than the public rather  

24:28
the mainstream media being interested in it they 
just keep smearing everybody as like far-right   conspiracy theorists what every journalist I've 
mentioned thus far is on the left in fact many  

24:37
of these people were excited about giving brigit 
a platform because they themselves are feminists  

24:43
feminists and finally they said let me profile 
this woman and then they realized something is   very wrong here something I cannot why am I being 
called in to the El Palace what have I done wrong  

24:54
why does this feel like a police interrogation 
I'm just trying to ask some questions   but it's not just frit now let's discuss Emanuel 
macron's biography because it's pretty interesting  

25:05
pretty interesting this guy so The Story Goes that 
he like Brit was born in Aman Aman is the capital  

25:14
town or city within the department of Som okay 
so in France they call these departments I like  

25:21
to think of departments as States if you're from 
America and uh so think of uh Aman as the capital  

25:28
capital of the state of Psalm Aman also has a ton 
of History getting back to the Middle Ages because  

25:34
it is the ancient capital of picardi which just 
to be clear that just means like northern France  

25:40
I'm telling you that for a reason now jumping 
back into his biography I am now going to read  

25:46
directly from journalist Xavier P's forthcoming 
book which we should be announcing for you guys  

25:52
this week he writes quote Emmanuel m gred remains 
a mystery to those who went to school with him his  

26:02
former classmates describe him as quote the only 
one we didn't know anything about neither where he  

26:09
spent his vacations nor what his parents did for 
a living they describe him as a loner not much  

26:15
socialized not Gathering others around him later 
at the school Henry IV he stayed in the background  

26:24
elusive quote he maintained an air of M a parallel 
life of which we knew nothing no one knows of any  

26:33
close friends among his 48 fellow students he had 
a very striking chameleon likee manner end quote  

26:42
Emanuel macron's early life before he met brijit 
is similarly a black hole journalists who have  

26:48
tried to cover the subject of all Fallen back on 
Cross portraits for lack of material testimonials  

26:54
photographs Etc the information that could be 
gathered can be summed up in in a few lines  

27:00
Xavier goes on and says born on December 21st 1977 
in Aman Emanuel macron spent his childhood on Ru  

27:08
gotier de rili the street in Henryville which 
is the upscale District of Aman in a house that  

27:15
was bought in 1982 by his parents parents 
Jean Michelle macron a neuropsychiatrist at  

27:24
Aman University Hospital from a Picard family and 
franois no that would be his mother a pediatrician  

27:31
who became an expert for Social Security just 
going to pause before I jump into Exavier script  

27:36
here so we get the picture okay his dad is a 
psychiatrist his mom is a doctor to Children  

27:43
interesting combo that's all I'm saying that's 
all I'm saying for right now but I'm going to   say a lot more her family originates from and 
this is franois no his mother from bag uh and  

27:56
that is in the hot ping n region I'm going to talk 
about that later the couple had two more children  

28:02
so Emanuel born in 1977 then came Laurent born in 
1979 his brother and Estelle his sister born in  

28:12
1982 all born within 5 years of one another both 
Physicians before divorcing in 2010 Emanuel macron  

28:22
also has a half brother his name is Gabriel he 
was born in 2005 from his father's second marriage  

28:28
to a woman named Helen Jolie also a psychiatrist 
at The Institute of educational medicine in PSM  

28:39
okay now in 2017 Emanuel mcon released his own 
autobiography which was entitled Revolution okay  

28:49
that similarly provided very few scant details 
about his background and it was actually Sylvie  

28:56
bmel an independent journalist who writes for 
Vanity Fair again we aren't on Reddit threads  

29:01
guys we're not on the Deep Web who summed up his 
autobiography this way this is what she said about  

29:06
his autobiography in Revolution Emmanuel devotes 
five pages to his maternal grandmother only one  

29:15
to his parents and two lines to his brother 
Lorent and his sister Estelle nor is there  

29:22
any mention of his half brother Gabriel born in 
2005 from his father's second marriage marriage  

29:28
and even less of his father's companion Helen 
conversely he scrupulously mentions the first  

29:35
names of Brit's three children and their spouses 
as well as those of her seven grandchildren she  

29:42
has since had an eighth one on the day of the 
inauguration the oier were the only ones to tread  

29:48
the red carpet leading up to the El Palace tone 
and Laurence blonde slim and elegant and their  

29:55
brother Sebastian all accompanied by their spouse 
and their children the estrangement is reciprocal  

30:02
in 2014 a colleague of his brother Lorent at the 
hospital asked him if mcon working with Francois  

30:09
haland at the time at the El Palace was a close 
relative no he's a vague cousin everyone's bugging  

30:16
me about this guy replied his brother Lorent 
okay maybe maybe Loren just didn't want to be  

30:23
asked about a question about a minister and just 
said that weird then a woman named Nicole who is  

30:31
a a first cousin of emanuel's Mother Francis 
no similarly told a reporter that she hardly  

30:37
ever saw Emmanuel's alleged sister Estelle that's 
very weird Okay Sylvie Bell again the journalist  

30:46
Vanity Fair writer reputable mainstream media 
also said this she said quote I had a hard time  

30:53
finding emanuel's friends he never talked about 
his family we are hard pressed to find any photos  

31:00
of his early years when as a grown-up he launched 
his presidential campaign many political analysts  

31:06
noted that his Communications were inspired by 
Obama even if this is the case he has neglected  

31:12
his early childhood anyone interested in the 
former United States President Obama can have with  

31:18
emotion at baby Barack in a romper suit the chubby 
kid wielding his first baseball bat the kid with  

31:24
two holes where he just lost his baby teeth and 
short watching him grow up our president's photo  

31:31
album begins in his 10th year the shot was taken 
in the choir of the Chapel of the law Providence  

31:38
school with Emanuel reading a passage from the 
Bible around his neck a shiny Meadow worn for   the first time marks the day of his baptism at 
age 12 franois and Jean Michelle have a distant  

31:50
relationship with religion of course they were 
married in a church to enjoy the pump of the event   and gather their families they never considered 
having the baby baptized wow Life Starts at the  

32:01
age of 12 in photos that's a bit weird here are 
the three photos she's referring to by the way   which were widely considered to be the first 
known photos of Emanuel mccrone one that she's  

32:12
describing from his baptism one from his seventh 
grade year at providance and the third which is  

32:19
another one from his studies it's almost like he 
grew up in the Provident school with brigit right  

32:24
uhoh this going to be a quote and I'm going to get 
a letter from Emanuel she said he grew up in the   school that didn't happen we're suing you for 
defamation oddly however I should mention that  

32:33
when Xavier pisard kept digging he did find 
that there were some uncredited and seemingly  

32:38
unauthorized photos that appeared in you guessed 
it Paris match one of uh Mimi maran's favorite  

32:44
Publications in May of 2017 when we know Mimi 
marshand the pr killer so to speak um figuratively  

32:53
was uh running comms for them so in May of 20 
2017 these photos appeared and I'm going to show  

33:01
you those okay so we're seeing a kid it tells 
us in the captions that this is Emanuel macron  

33:09
when he was 3 years old by the way if you guys 
are French and watching this if somebody could   identify those sneakers that would be amazing 
later on in the comments I'll get a closeup of  

33:17
that for you guys I'm just curious as to like what 
sneaker brand that is it says he's he's reading  

33:23
Sylvester and Tweety have this crazy blonde hair 
and that one at the bottom right is supposed to  

33:28
be him at his father's um office of medicine and 
you'll notice that again these young photos he's  

33:35
got all of these siblings there's no photos of him 
with his siblings and who authorized these photos   they're literally not credited in that magazine 
issue of where these photos came from and they  

33:45
are never again included in any biography whether 
um it's autobiography whether it's an authorized  

33:52
biography or an unauthorized biography we 
don't get to see those photos again okay  

33:58
so to recap the macron side of the family is 
supposed to have deep roots in Aman okay they're  

34:04
supposed to be picardi yet when another journalist 
a gay journalist named Herve alga loranda and why  

34:11
I'm telling you he's gay and openly gay uh is not 
to call him out but because don't forget a big  

34:17
piece of what the media says is that everybody's 
lgbtq phobic that's the reason why anybody is even  

34:22
saying anything about her well this guy certainly 
is not okay Herve alal laranda made what is likely  

34:29
the greatest effort to look into Emanuel macron's 
upbringing in his investigative book uh which in  

34:34
English is two young French women okay and he 
similarly found some really odd things foremost  

34:43
the former mayor of Aman A man's named G de roban 
I'm showing you him right there who was close with  

34:50
the trogo family because Aman is close-knit and 
therefore in no way was trying to shade them or  

34:55
harm them in any way said this about Emanuel Macon 
he said maon is not amena he is tuet meaning he's  

35:04
not like from the town of Aman he's like from 
louet which is L is a Seaside town in France  

35:13
what did he mean by that what do you mean he's 
a a tedan is he suggesting that macron was was  

35:19
not from Aman at all because that would be weird 
why wouldn't a city mayor in which the president  

35:25
of France was born in want to take full credit 
for his birth like yes Emanuel cron is for from  

35:32
here maybe he just meant that he spent more of 
his time or the most of his time outside of the  

35:38
city I don't know what he meant by this but he 
said it at least according to that book surely  

35:44
they would want to claim them right but people 
even called into question macron's interest in  

35:50
his own birthplace of Aman because um from that 
very same book we find out that Emanuel mcon quote  

35:58
skipped the commemoration while he was in office 
of the Centenary of the battle of Aman on August  

36:04
8th 2018 the Amon born mrrone was conspicuously 
absent while Teresa may then the prime minister of  

36:11
the United Kingdom and Prince William one of Queen 
Elizabeth's grandsons were present the English had  

36:16
stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the French in the 
battle of the world of World War I the start of  

36:21
the Allies Victorious offensive Emanuel mccrone 
did not attend the celebration even though his  

36:27
family's birthplace aie it's another city was on 
the front line of another famous battle the battle  

36:32
of s and the castle housed a field Hospital even 
though he knows full well as he has mentioned in  

36:39
several speeches that picardi still Bears the 
scars of the wars against Germany okay maybe  

36:45
he was busy that day let's not get too crazy also 
I should mention that before Emanuel had entered  

36:50
the political scene in 2012 he had considered 
running for municipal office but never in the  

36:56
bicardi region only only in P de Cal which is 
further North that's the same P de Cal that bik  

37:03
worked within as a press secretary maybe that's 
why maybe they were already in the midst of their   Affair I'm not sure and then it's just about to 
get outright embarrassing okay when you consider  

37:13
the massive blunder that gets made by President 
Emanuel macron in regards to the other side of  

37:19
his family Roots the no right his mom side ran 
no is his mom from suaz no is his mom remember  

37:26
her family traces back back to the town of hot 
that is a region of Pyrenees okay think of the  

37:33
Pyrenees Mountains basically they border Spain 
and France so there's a lot of different spoken  

37:40
languages a few different spoken languages in that 
region historically so mccrone in his presidential  

37:46
capacity goes to visit Andor in 2018 and he 
presents himself as a child of the P of of the  

37:53
Pyrenees okay and this exchange happen between 
him and a corsac national official his name was  

38:01
Xavier Luciani and it was captured this exchange 
was captured by a journalist from Express magazine  

38:08
because you know in president's travel they have 
like the pool of journalists that travel with them   and they're recording and they're listening to the 
conversations and he's speaking to this andoran  

38:20
guy and the journalist writes that mcon said this 
quote I had great grandparents who were bordon  

38:27
they only spoke penan their sole aim in life 
was that my grandmother would attend a state  

38:36
school to learn French think about it end quote 
so he's opening up here now we know he was close  

38:43
to his grandmother he wrote the most about 
his grandmother um in his book The Republic  

38:48
and he's saying that his grandmother like he the 
sole aim of her parents was for his grandmother  

38:57
to stop speaking penan and to go to a school and 
learn French go to a state school and learn French  

39:05
and he goes think about it think about how amazing 
now he's a president of France and that was all  

39:10
his great grandparents wanted for his beloved 
grandmother and you know what that politician   did think about it probably not for very long 
because it turns out that penan is not and has  

39:20
never been a language it's just amazing that is is 
just amazing no never bit of language they didn't  

39:31
know what the heck he was talking about they're 
going what are you talking about peran what is   that that's not a thing people here speak a bunch 
of different languages and that's not one of them  

39:38
it's oxyon catalon nobody speaks penan what are 
you trying to say man so he just made up a piece  

39:46
of his childhood so that was weird that was real 
weird man real weird to be emotionally attached  

39:52
to a language that never existed anyways uh 
back to the journalist Herve GA lorando he  

39:58
tried desperately thereafter to speak to anyone 
in the macron family but they were as thick as   thieves okay he got shot down shot down shot down 
then there was an official in boray who gave him  

40:10
an idea okay and the idea that came across his 
mind was you know what I should actually I want  

40:15
to learn about Emanuel macron's history I should 
speak to Brit weird right the reason why this idea  

40:21
popped into his mind was that that official told 
him that when Emanuel mrrone had visited bagay  

40:27
okay another city out of Civility he was making 
conversation and he asked Emanuel macron about   his sister Estelle because she lived nearby and 
he says that apparently Emanuel Marron turned to  

40:39
Brit to know what to answer he turned to his wife 
to know what to answer about his sister I don't  

40:51
know about how you guys are feeling right now but 
I'm starting to get a little icky feeling it's   it's all starting to feel a bit incestuous to me 
you know like why she knows so much and why is he  

41:00
like more into her family I don't know it's very 
weird right we she probably paused there but for  

41:05
fun I am going to tease you with these this photo 
two photos and I want you guys to know this is  

41:11
this is real this is not made up okay because next 
next episode we're going to get into Jean Michelle   trno The Sibling that has now suddenly appeared 
um for the first time the public is being made  

41:21
aware of him and um John Michelle trau allegedly 
has a son okay allegedly this guy whoever he is  

41:30
John Michelle trau who seems to be missing has a 
son named Jean Jack who is not missing John jack  

41:37
is not missing and I'm going to just give you a 
a side by side of Jean Jack and Emanuel macron  

41:44
okay and here's another one of Jean Jack and Eman 
mcon now these two are not related okay one on the  

41:51
left is allegedly Brit who claims she is not Jean 
Michelle trno that's that's allegedly bit's nephew  

41:59
that is Jean Michelle trag's son this is not the 
mrrone side of the family okay this is Bri this  

42:06
is the trogo side of the family and that's her 
husband and it is just amazing it is just amazing  

42:13
but ladies and gentlemen do not believe your 
own eyes do not believe your own eyes you know  

42:19
what we should do in this next episode we have 
absolutely got to get into his grandma the one who  

42:27
who at some point I guess must have spoke peran I 
don't know something like that because then things  

42:33
are going to start to get really interesting and 
then we're going to learn a bit more about his mom  

42:38
his dad the psychiatrist and some things that he 
kind of left out about them and what specifically  

42:44
what kind of work were these psychiatrists and 
pediatricians involved in and then maybe we're  

42:50
going to start patching in some ideas about what 
might have been going on politically at that time   while he was growing up and and this is going to 
turn into to a scary story not wait to read your  

43:00
questions guys first want to tell you about 
American financing because a lot of Americans   are carrying High credit card balances that charge
