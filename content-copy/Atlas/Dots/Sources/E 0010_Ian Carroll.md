# Summary of Episode

1. Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs Blackmail Network:
    - Epstein‚Äôs blackmail operation, detailed by Whitney Webb, targeted elites (Clinton, Prince Andrew, tech billionaires) with cameras in his properties, confirmed by 2019 seizures. His ties to Israeli intelligence via Leslie Wexner, Ehud Barak, Robert Maxwell, and Ari Ben-Menashe suggest he worked for Israel, not Qatar or Saudi Arabia. Speculation about his survival in witness protection aligns with QAnon-like theories but raises questions about elite protection.
2. Israeli Influence and Espionage:
    - Israel‚Äôs history of spying on the U.S. (Jonathan Pollard, Promise software, nuclear program theft) and the [[Samson Option]] (nuclear blackmail) frame Epstein‚Äôs network as part of a broader intelligence operation. Jewish organized crime‚Äôs role in founding Israel, via figures like Wexner and the Mega Group, is distinguished from anti-Semitism, focusing on specific criminal networks.
3. West Bank Surveillance and Tech Control:
    - The West Bank serves as a testing ground for surveillance tech (Palantir‚Äôs Blue Wolf, NSO Group‚Äôs Pegasus, Paragon‚Äôs Graphite), with Israeli firms like Unit 8200 exporting spyware globally, as seen in Jamal Khashoggi‚Äôs killing. Palantir, funded partly by Epstein, and Thiel‚Äôs influence on JD Vance and Trump raise concerns about tech elites controlling U.S. policy, symbolized by Lord of the Rings-inspired names.
4. Israeli Atrocities and Middle East Conflict:
    - Israel‚Äôs actions in Gaza (lacing flour with oxycodone, killing 400+ civilians at aid sites, estimated 50,000‚Äì400,000 deaths) and West Bank settlement expansion (led by Smotrich, Ben-Gvir) are criticized as genocidal. Netanyahu‚Äôs funding of Hamas via Qatar and domestic opposition highlight his controversial leadership, with U.S. support (Nikki Haley, Randy Fine) enabling these policies.
5. Zionism and Religious Indoctrination:
    - Zionism‚Äôs reliance on religious indoctrination (e.g., Ted Cruz‚Äôs Genesis misinterpretation) is challenged by engaging believers with questions to expose contradictions. The hosts argue that supporting Israel‚Äôs land claims based on religious texts violates others‚Äô free agency, conflicting with American freedom values, especially as anti-Israel criticism faces legal restrictions.
6. Trump, Tech Influence, and MAGA Dynamics:
    - Trump‚Äôs administration is criticized for unfulfilled promises (Epstein files, deportations), new speech laws, and tech influence (Thiel, Ellison, Altman, Sacks). The hosts distinguish patriotism (criticizing leaders) from loyalism (blind Trump support), urging scrutiny of tech elites like Thiel, who backs JD Vance, and their potential control over U.S. sovereignty.
7. AI and Technological Threats:
    - AI‚Äôs potential to eliminate knowledge scarcity, coupled with DARPA‚Äôs drone swarms and mosquito drones, threatens a 1984-like society. Five AI executives appointed as U.S. Army lieutenant colonels and Palantir‚Äôs West Bank operations highlight tech‚Äôs growing control, with fears of digital IDs and CBDCs enabling mass surveillance.
8. Patriotism vs. Loyalism and Individual Action:
    - The hosts advocate for patriotism over loyalism, emphasizing criticism of leaders to uphold values. Facing a controlled world, they focus on controllable actions: personal growth, family, and community. Their role is to fight evil by raising awareness, not to win but to contribute to good, aligning with a moral duty to strive.
9. Speculative Theories (Aliens, Ancient Civilizations):
    - The hosts explore aliens as interdimensional beings and the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis (via Graham Hancock), suggesting a comet 12,900 years ago destroyed advanced civilizations. A ‚Äúmissing piece‚Äù (AGI, UAPs, or a global cult) may explain global inconsistencies, with the Epstein client list as a key withheld truth.

## Final Notes

The combined analysis integrates both sections into a coherent narrative, focusing on Ian Carol‚Äôs journey, Epstein‚Äôs Israeli-linked blackmail, tech surveillance, Israeli policies, and the need for critical patriotism. The timeline merges events chronologically, the character list consolidates overlapping figures, and the topic summary groups related themes to avoid redundancy. If you have specific preferences for further refinement (e.g., deeper focus on a topic, visual aids, or additional analysis), please let me know. Additionally, if you‚Äôd like me to verify any claims (e.g., via X or web searches) or generate related content (e.g., charts), I can proceed with your guidance.

00:50
undefined

00:53
really cool idea so I also started to kind of do that uh so Right down there next to you, there's a black bag and

01:00
it's full of a bunch of goodies and I'm going to I'm going to walk you through all of it. I know some of the things. Save save the one for the last, but I'm

01:05
going to walk you through the rest of it. So, dig in. Oh, sick, dude. All right, so there's two of them.

01:11
Um, so this is from a buddy of mine. His name is Bryce. He owns a local uh holster company called Teton Customs,

01:18
and he's made me all of my stuff, dude. So, that is, and you'll see why in a minute, but the colors on that, as well

01:24
as the other one. There's another one in there. These are actually exactly what I need right now. Yeah. So, we now I know why you were asking me.

01:29
Now you know why I asked why kind of gun you have. Yeah. So, we matched up the colors to match uh

01:34
what you're about to pull out of there. I guess we could just do it right now. Might as well cuz it matches.

01:41
Oh, the shirt. Yep. Oh, yeah. So, we talked about making you a signature t-shirt for Patriot gear

01:49
because you have been rocking official Patriot gear for so long and dude, we just appreciate

01:54
it's like my favorite shirts to rock so much. I like they go everywhere all the time. Yeah. So, that's your painting,

02:27
Yeah. So, walk us through what the painting is cuz I still don't even know. I just know how important it is to you. And we were like, we want to do

02:32
something that's like very Ian. Your signatures on that sleeve, dude.

02:37
And uh Yeah, man. So, so walk us through. The background in the lettering is pulled from a painting that I did

02:43
undefined

02:43
actually like I think in 2013. Okay. It would have been when I was 17 or 18. I did a ton of art when I was younger

02:50
and um and it's not like the crazy it's not like anything super special, but I was really into graffiti

02:56
art as a kid and I I went through a phase of making um paintings of word

03:02
like graffiti art words for my friends, my brother of like words that represented them. And at some point

03:09
during that phase, I found this giant door at a thrift shop that's like eight feet wide long. Yeah. And I painted this

03:15
giant painting that says the wanderers on it as like a just a fun word, good letters. Sick s on the end.

03:21
But also as like this sort of like creative like soul kind of thing. Um and it just has lived like in garage and

03:28
storage at house I've lived in. It's just kind of made it the whole way. And so then when I was setting up my first

03:34
studio, I was like, "This is sick." And it goes well with the balance painting. And I just put them up and then it became a part of my set. And then when I

03:39
was packing up to go on the road, I was like, "You know what? That could fit in the minivan." And so now, now the

03:45
wanderers, this giant door and balance both go in the minivan with me and they go with me on the road and they're like

03:52
my art. And so when you hit me up about maybe making a shirt, I was immediately like, "Dude, can I put my art in it?"

03:58
Yeah. And I was like, "No brainer." And it's it's interesting because figuring out how to make it because at first the first iteration that we made, it didn't

04:06
look like I wanted it to. It didn't quite pop. It almost looked like it was very bland and it didn't give it didn't

04:11
do justice to the actual painting itself. So, we actually, if you notice, we actually took like pieces of the painting and kind of blended them

04:17
together. And yeah, like little collage. It's a little bit of a This is the top of the S right here. I can tell.

04:22
Yep. This is part of the R, dude. Yeah. This is the W right there. And

04:28
but I really like how it turned out, dude. It looks awesome. There's actually a piece of the A in the A. Yep.

04:33
So, yeah, man. Yeah, absolutely. There's a little bit more stuff in there. So, you pulled one other thing out there that's for Gigi.

04:38
Yeah. A little dog card. Yeah, man. Oh, sick. I got to get myself an AR now. Okay. So, this So, I think I've told you

04:46
a little bit about my mag club. So, I do I do a monthly mag club. There's mags right there. That big brother is dude. This one is

04:52
the one that hasn't come out yet. It's coming out next month. It's the It's for the founding. So every single month we come out with a mag that has something

04:58
to do with a historical event in our country that month. So next month is the founding of the CIA.

05:05
That's legit. And so of course I had to throw in Big Brother.

05:11
That's big brother. That's Big Brother from the movie, huh? And of course we had to put in all the elements of MK Ultra.

05:16
Yep. Because that's what it looks like. Yep. LSD and the special colored mag. So it's just a P mag. It's 223 556 300 blackout.

05:24
You get an AR15 you can run it through. Um, but yeah. Oh, sick, dude. I was just commenting.

05:29
I know. I wasn't going to give it away. So, there it is. Yeah. It's magnetic, too, and it snaps. Yeah. So, that's your zinc can holder.

05:36
Dude, that's legit. I actually literally have one to throw in right there. Yeah. And it's sturdy. I mean, you could

05:41
drop the thing off a building, dude, and it'll be I might just I might just

05:47
Dude, we got some meat. First form meat sticks and protein bars. Hell yeah.

05:52
Uh, they're the best. They taste super good. Oh, sick. Patriot flag. Nice.

05:58

06:04
And I think that's it. Oh, and then the card. Just the little card. Yep. I'll save the card for later. Yep. So, anyway, just wanted to

06:11
Oh, yeah. And that's from Teton Customs. Yep. Yeah. So, you can Dude, thanks, bro. Yeah, of course, man. Um,

06:18
I am stoked. Yeah. Yeah, cuz my next road trip is to go pick up the second Glock. Well, now

06:23

06:34
So, just want to give you a little bit more of like an because I know you appreciate more colors and things and so I was like, let's do something, you

06:39

so far and Oh, I couldn't be more stoked to have you drive. Yeah. Yeah. Cool country.

07:13
Um so thanks for coming. So, so here I got to say something though because you talked about your minivan.

07:18
Yeah, dude. Well, let's talk about the Qatari money, dude. Also, also, is it Qatar or is it cutter?

07:24
Um, I've actually I watch I watch videos about it. It's Qatar. It'sQatar.

07:29
Okay. So, let's talk about your That's [¬†__¬†] Like, I'm from Mexico. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So,

07:30
undefined

07:34
let's talk about your Qatari money. Well, I've been raking it in this year, dude. I have been raking it in, let me tell you. Um, and I once the check

07:43
started flowing heavy, um, I figured I should hit the road and like live road

07:49
life. So, I went on Craigslist and I bought a $2,500 Kia minivan and it is

07:54
the [¬†__¬†] We call her Minnie and she is a powerhouse and she's been across the country like three times plus now. Um,

08:01
like literally from Washington to Florida to Washington to California to

08:07
Texas, Tennessee, California, Washington, Idaho, and a few others in between.

08:13
Dude, all my life fits in it. Two dogs, myself, the girlfriend. Like, everything fits in her. Literally, a door, a table,

08:20
the whole camera setup, all the tripods. Now I've got a teleprompter and an extra camera and all this [¬†__¬†] plus like

08:27
clothes. I've got a big extra screen for my computer. I got my laptop. I got it all, dude. All in a minivan.

08:33
Okay, so the reason I bring this up is because I want to talk about the absolute absurdity that I that I witnessed. And honestly, like I said, we

08:39
kind of talked about this a little bit. It was a little bit of a wakeup call for me as well. So, cuz I was in Austin with you, I

08:45
don't know, was it five week five months ago? Something like that. Yeah. We went to the comedy club. It was super fun. Had a great time.

08:50
At the time, you're staying at an Airbnb. Yep. Um Yeah, that's what I do is I Airbnb where I go month-long stays. You save a little

08:56
money. But it was so fascinating to me to, you know, we hung out for a few days. It was super fun. Came out and I

09:02
was like, this is one of the most like down to earth, genuine dudes I've ever met. And then to see So that that's like

09:09
right before you went on Joe Rogan. And then obviously after you went on Joe Rogan, things just kind of like went insane. And all of a sudden now I start

09:15
seeing all this stuff about people saying you're getting Qatari money and that you're an agent and that something

09:20
about your bracelet and like all this other crazy stuff. And it so two things. Number one, it opened my eyes to how

09:26
easy it is to create a narrative about somebody that you don't know. And it it kind of made me walk things

09:31
back a little bit about how I've reported stuff and like same and because the reality is I was like,

09:38
"Dude, you guys sound like if you only knew, you sound like such morons." I literally witnessed the fact that this

09:43
guy lives out of a minivan. Like him and his dog, cuz at the time you weren't even with your girlfriend. It was literally you and your dog living

09:49
out of a minivan. And that minivan looked like it was lived out of. Oh yeah. So, I was like, "Dude, this guy

09:55
has like pennies to rub together right now." Yeah. And yet, here are all these people saying he's some rich crazy agent. And

10:01
I'm like, you know, it would be it would be a pretty wild lifestyle to just like live a life like that when you didn't

10:08
have to. Well, I I mean, I could like actually in a lot of ways I was I am living a life

10:13
like that when I don't have to because I could monetize my platform way more for

10:18
sure. Way [¬†__¬†] more. like I blew up on Tik Tok and Tik Tok pays good money for

10:24
views, but you can also get good money for ads on Tik Tok. So, um in 2023, May of 2023, I started and by May, June,

10:30
undefined

10:32
July, August, by August, uh at least I was like I it was 3 months later, I was

10:38
at almost a million followers. Yeah. And that's because of Tik Tok, though. Just Tik Tok, which is why I didn't even have the other platforms

10:43
yet. Yeah. That's why when people say, "Oh, it's crazy how fast you blow up." It's like, "No, dude. That's what Tik Tok was." Like, I know people that did that

10:48
on Tik Tok. And I was doing this whole Black Rockck conspiracy grocery store aisle thing that was super viral, super fun, super interesting. I just put out a

10:54
whole YouTube video about it um just yesterday. Um people can watch that stuff. They can go all the way back. It's not hard.

10:59
Scroll my TikTok all the way back to the beginning. It takes like 45 seconds, right? Um and within three months there, like I

11:05
was charging $3,000 easily for advertising. And I purposely only did advertising

11:12
with family and founder own brands because I didn't want to work with all the [¬†__¬†] I didn't want to support corporate. I didn't want to support like

11:18
I'm doing all this reporting about how mega corporations suck ass and then L'Oreal is emailing me being like, "Hey, do you want to advertise for us?" Like,

11:24
"No, get wrecked." Like, "No." And so I took L'Oreal's email and I and I was like, "Yeah, L'Oreal, I'll do a free ad

11:30
for you. Here's all the lawsuits that L'Oreal is in for screwing their customers over. Here's all the horrible [¬†__¬†] that L'Oreal's done. Here's like

11:37
all the their ownership is like just shhat on them for a whole video. Put it out for free." And was like, "There's your ad, L'Oreal. Take it."

11:43
That's amazing. I didn't even know you did that. Yeah, that's like how I that's how I view advertising. And but at the

11:49
same time, I was doing I was like working with family and founder own business to be like, "Hey, if you can't

11:54
do $3,000 for an ad, that's fine. Let's do 2,000 cuz I want to support you. You're a cool company. I appreciate you

12:00
wanting to support me." Um, and I worked with like four or five family and founder owned businesses.

12:05
Clearly disclosed those ads in those videos. But I kind of got tired of it because I had had enough success and I

12:10
jumped to Twitter and I was just like, I'm used to being a poor dirt bag. I'm a rock climber and ultramarathon runner

12:16
that used to work in kitchens and travel the world on like literally nothing. So I I'm very familiar with being poor and

12:22
I'm not stressed about having like a small bank account. Um and so I I got to this point where I had more money than I'd ever had and it

12:29
was not not a lot but I didn't need to do ads and I just didn't want it. It's like you're dude you're also not a

12:34
materialistic person. You can tell just from meeting you once like it's not you know what I mean? That's why

12:40
I'm an experiential person. Yes. And experiences are what you remember. experiences are what matter. I'm very much the same. And like I, you

12:46
know, that's why when I met you, I was like, "Okay, I get this. Like this is this is how I live my life." And it's like,

12:52
it was just so funny to watch um to to just watch the meltdown cuz I'm like, "You guys sound so stupid." And if you

12:58
only knew how stupid you actually sound. And you're right about it getting me to think twice about how I report on other

13:00
undefined

13:04
people because I had for you to pull the trigger on other people about like, "Oh, you're an OP or like you're weird or

13:09
what's up with that." But like when everyone's doing it to me and I know the truth of my own life and I realize like how much these people are how many

13:16
people burn their credibility in my mind of like I could never trust your reporting again cuz I can see what like

13:22
random strings you're throwing together to try to make up stories about me and like I know my life. So it just really

13:27
got me to pump the brakes on like if I'm going to report on someone or something I should report it the way I know it as

13:33
in this source says this, this source says this, I've like I heard this from this whatever it is. It's like, but you

13:39
don't really know other people. You don't really know the truth about most things. And then obviously working with Candace

13:44
took that to another level because she is very experienced at like you got to get it right when you're saying that the

13:50
first lady of France has a dick because otherwise you're screwed. And you know,

13:55
fortunately, she got that one right and she hasn't been sued. But um like you

14:00
just learn over time how to play the game in a way where you don't burn yourself by being an idiot. And a lot of

14:06
people that are like truth seekers and diggers came up with these wild Ian Carol conspiracies that are just like I w I like you, but now I can't trust any

14:14
of your other reporting because I see how willing to put together random straws you are.

14:19
Yes. Um it's truly the term grasping of straws. Yes. And there's two different things going on here. So like I go on Joe

14:25
Rogan's um show and a huge audience that did not know me before suddenly knows me and it's like ah he came out of nowhere

14:31
kind of. But there's two different things that happened after that because one was legitimate truth seekers that

14:37
are cool people that are rightly on the lookout for controlled opposition plants and that's a real thing

14:43
and we should be on the lookout for it but I think a lot of them go about it in a way

14:50
wrong way but that's you know their own choice but then there's another thing that was happening and that was that on Rogan I

14:58
uh for the first time in some ways on Rogan Israel really got criticized in a

15:04
big way. And we talked about Epstein working for Israel. We talked about Whitney Webb's books. You also dove into

15:10
third. We did pizza gate which that one I think that one was actually probably the buzzword that really took things off with Joe Rogan.

15:17
It could have been because most people don't touch that one. Yeah. And we touched it right to the point right to the heart of it and like

15:22
where it was enough but not the fire hose. Exactly. The stuff that's easy to check, easy to look up for yourself and there's a lot there, a lot to dig up. And so

15:30
there was a whole bunch of of controlled opposition attacks on me and that is the

15:35
Qatari accusations. The people saying that Candace is funded byQatar or Ian Carol is funded by guitar, Tucker was

15:40
funed byQar, that is a clear propaganda tactic and everyone that is saying that is clearly either actually on the take

15:48
to spread propaganda or they're ideologically on the take and doing it of their own accord

15:54
or they're just [¬†__¬†] dumb. Um because that's ridiculous. And uh I mean like

16:01
I'm not going to show people my bank account, but like it's pretty obvious. It's pretty obvious to me. It's pretty obvious to everyone that knows me. And

16:06
also like you don't have to be paid by Qar to oppose the bombing of children.

16:11
You don't have to be paid by guitar to oppose going to war in the Middle East. Right. Well, and by the way, uh let's I mean,

16:18
we're going to jump. You know who is paid by guitar? Yeah, I was going to say we're going to jump all over the place, but you know who is paid by guitar? Benjamin. Yeah. Do you know who actually went behind?

16:25
You know who's actually funding both sides of that? Yeah. Benjamin Netanyahu. And you know how long he's been doing that for? Years.

16:30
undefined

16:30
Long, long time. You know how I know that? It's because I watched the documentary the BB Files that is, you know, coincidentally like basically

16:36
unavailable anywhere you go. Most people don't even know it exists. And then when you watch it, you're like,

16:42
"Oh, oh, this is the truth." Like this guy is literally evil

16:48
incarnate. Like he is Oh, that's why we're at war in Israel right now because BB is gonna get put in prison the moment the war stops. Yeah.

16:55
And and we need to continue to keep that distraction up. And by the way, his whole country wants him to be in prison. Oh, yeah.

17:00
It's not just like some people, they all want him in prison. And because he How long has he been in

17:06
power now? 25 years, something like that. Off and on. He he was taken out of office for a little bit there. And and the fact that it shines a light

17:15
on the uh how do you say Knesset? Is that how you say the Knesset? It it

17:20
shines a light on his executives that he chose. So you have Smootrich, you have uh Ben Gear, you have

17:26
like these guys are the worst of the worst. They like you have terrorists. Yeah, dude. You have the you have the

17:32
former prime minister literally saying they are genocidal Jewish terrorists. I shouldn't have said that, but oh well,

17:39
YouTube. But it's the reality though. That's what they are. And and they are and they're

17:45
not just saying that because of their ideology. They're saying that because of their actions. I mean the party that went to jail for

17:50
it. Yeah. Yeah. Boich. Well, he didn't quite go to jail. He was investigating. Never went through. But he was in Ben was a

17:56
member of the Kavich party. The catch catch party. I always mispronounce it. Yes. Um catch party. And it was founded by a

18:03
Jewish terrorist in America. And it was a genocidal like ethnationalist

18:08
organization that Israel deemed a terrorist. Well, and dude, they have Smoke Church on video multiple times saying that they need to ethnic

18:15
ethnically cleanse the entire region and that we're not afraid of the word occupation and like I it's it's crazy,

18:22
dude. And like look, if that's your stance and you want to defend that, defend that. Try try your best defend that. But what

18:28
I don't get down with is the people that try to play all these weird propaganda games, all these weird

18:33
You can't have a conversation with somebody. And you have it. It always is like anytime the conversation starts the

18:40
immediate talking points come up. Well, you're anti-Semitic obviously. Exactly. Exactly. Or you must be fun about guitar, right?

18:46
Exactly. And it's and we're just America's so done with it. And that's the problem is that mo every day more

18:51
Americans are waking up cuz we're just like we're all done not talking about it. And and you can only

18:57
tell someone that the sky is green for so long before they look up. And that's what this whole guitar thing

19:00
undefined

19:02
is. It's like a last stitch effort to like just smear them. just just call them some sort of controlled opposition

19:08
or something or and it's like okay guys if that's really the tactic you want to take if you want to just die on the

19:13
anti-semitism and Qatari money hill be my guest because we can all look at who's actually buying out Congress who

19:20
Congress is actually posting in support of who is are we actually passing laws on behalf of it's like it's very obvious

19:25
what's going on here yeah well and also you know I got dude I got so much hate when when the whole

19:30
thing with Iran went down the amount of hate that I got simply for just saying no just simply for saying hey this looks

19:38
a lot like Iraq again this looks a lot like Afghanistan uh maybe we shouldn't do this this isn't America first right

19:44
just for saying that the amount of hate I got because immediately I was going against this this narrative of you know

19:51
MAGA MAGA MAGA or whatever and it's like first of all MAGA is not about a person it's not about a president it never at

19:57
least it shouldn't be MAGA should just be about the ideology of wanting America to be great and stand on its own legs

20:03
and when it came down. That's what it was about when Trump came. That's what it was about when Trump came up. Yeah. And and that's why so many people

20:09
grasp onto it. But I think it also has gotten to a point where so many people have got I I said this the other day, so

20:15
many people have become so hopeless and in in actually fixing the problems of

20:20
this country and fixing the fact that we are so highly influenced and there's so much corruption and quite frankly, we

20:27
are slaves to the system in a lot of ways and that it very much seems like everything is controlled. I think people

20:33
have gotten so hopeless that they have created the idea of Trump being the last

20:39
hope in their mind and so they need a white knight. I think that's a fair take. Yeah. And and that's I think that's what's

20:46
happened with a lot of and I'm not saying everybody, right? I'm not saying it's all of MAGA. I think Yeah, for

20:51
sure. But there's definitely like the extremist faction of MAGA where it's like he can do no wrong. He can make no

20:56
wrong mistakes. Everything is part of the plan. Everything is this operation. no matter what, we just need to trust what's happening. That is just blind

21:04
loyalty and loyalism. And I think it comes from an a need a like a desperate

21:09
need for hope. Yep. I agree. And it's worth mentioning that it's happening within a very

21:17
artificial internet atmosphere. Oh, for sure. Because yeah, Elon bought Twitter and freed it

21:23
and turned it into X. There is so much bot traffic. For sure. so much controlled bot traffic

21:30
undefined

21:31
from all directions, from all different angles, every so like this report came out recently that like all the Zionists

21:37
were like, "Look, see Nick Fuentes is like all bots. He's like propped up by

21:43
Iranian bot farms or whatever it is, right?" Yeah. And and you actually read the report, you realize that it was like

21:48
it was people that worked for the ADL that were funding this whole Israeli propaganda thing, but their actual reporting within the

21:54
report was that like 25% of the traffic was deemed as uh inauthentic

21:59
by another Israeli group. But 25% of the traffic deemed as inauthentic, that's like very par for

22:06
the course in Twitter. That's actually seems pretty low in my mind for Twitter. And if you were to actually analyze the

22:11
audiences of all of us on Twitter, like I would assume that I have at least 25% in inorganic traffic. I would assume

22:16
that everyone has at least 20 to 25% inorganic traffic. And I would assume that a lot of the propped up like shills

22:23
that are just shilling political talking points have way higher than that, right? And so it's like Twitter is a

22:32
battleground that want that gets everyone to fight and hate each other and argue and argue and argue. And in

22:38
that there are bots just feeding every fire and feeding all this weird disinformation and and trust and and

22:45
like hate that person and they're very smart. They're very smart. That's the scary part because I'll I'll

22:50
notice the bots cuz I I I can pull them out pretty easy. But at the same time when I see the the comments on them it's

22:56
like that's a really like thought out that's that's a that's an intellectual comment more and more now we're not able to see

23:03
them. I think that AI is rapidly advancing and certainly there are lots of because here's the thing is that not

23:08
all bots are created equal, right? I don't have access to the same AI tech that the CIA has access that Mossad has

23:14
access to that like some dude that wanted to pay for a bot farm to boost his account has access to. And so there

23:20
are all different tiers of of operations being like performed in the digital space. And I think that a lot of them we

23:27
can see still and I think a lot of them are way beyond that. Um, and you know,

23:32
that's why I have sympathy or empathy for the people that are like calling me controlled opposition because like at

23:38
least they're thinking about controlled like at least they're thinking critically about where the information is going. Yeah, that's a good point. But that

23:43
being said, like in this day and age, the amount of effort it takes to build

23:49
up a real in-person influencer, to have an influencer that has a whole life that's like out here meeting people in

23:55
Inerson podcast, to have someone like that on the take like in a deeply covert way, that is very complex. And they have

24:02
to have like they have to have training. They have to have like multiple like like you can't just go out there and

24:08
like do that with no skills, right? And also like why like for example I've got people that call me a

24:15
Qatar shill for Hamas and people that call me an Israel shill for Assad. And it's like I'm not sure why Israel would

24:21
be paying me to go on Candace Owens to make a whole episode about the BB files

24:26
for example or a whole episode saying that Epstein worked for Israel. So it's like you know I just think we need a

24:32
little more critical thinking and a little less confidence that you know what's right. Because like for me the most important thing is remembering that

24:38
I do not know what's going on and I do not know what's real and not on online. Like I don't know. I just try to work in

24:44
probabilities and I and I I really respect that about you, you know, cuz like I said, there's been

24:49
I I've definitely I'm I'm everybody's favorite conspiracy theorist, man. Like I I've definitely had some takes where

24:54
I'm like, "Yeah, that probably wasn't like that probably wasn't it. There was probably a lot more to it." I'll give

25:00
undefined

25:00
you a perfect example, actually. Um and I I'm actually curious of your opinion on it anyway. So, the whole new thing

25:06
about um AI tech uh um executives

25:11
becoming uh lieutenant colonels. Did you see that? No. Oh, yeah. So, they just made I think it

25:17
was five. They made five five tech executives lieutenant colonels. AI tech

25:23
executives lieutenant colonels in the army like officially like officially like they were officially ranked five.

25:28
So, that just happened. You did not see that. How recently with Palunteer? uh like probably within

25:34
the last week or two. Yeah. I mean, I've been pretty like nose deep in in what I'm working on right now. So, that's interesting.

25:39
We could pull it up. Um if if I believe you and I can I can think of a number of reasons why this might be

25:45
happening. Well, so here's the thing. So, immediately I jumped on it and I was like, this is insane. To go from rank

25:52
zero to rank five on tech bro credentials is pretty wild. Like the fact that that would happen. But here's

25:58
but I will and and I said like if this isn't kind of a sign of them ushering in

26:03
the ability to really really control this thing, I don't know what is. And that's that's what I said. But then I'll

26:09
be honest, I had a conversation with a buddy of mine who is in the Air Force. He's done a few different tours.

26:16
Very uh level-headed and very like common sense kind of guy. Definitely not

26:22
somebody who would say something out of pocket um for no reason. And what he said was, "You know what, dude? I get

26:28
that it could be walking a dangerous line, but he said, at the same time, if

26:33
you consider that we are at war with these other countries as far as an AI race goes," because he's like, "That is

26:39
what's happening right now. We are in an AI cold war." Yeah. And he said, "America,

26:45
the army is full of boomers that know jack about AI and the technology that

26:52
China has versus us as far as the army goes, as far as our military goes and actually being able to implement those those AI systems." He's like, "It's it's

27:00
non-existent." He's like, "It's not even it's bad. It's non-existent. We are not tapping into it at all." And so he said,

27:07
"It's like anything else, man. like who do you call and and what kind of ranking do you need to give them so that people

27:13
will listen to them to actually be able to implement the things you need to and continue to to fight in this race? And

27:18
so he said he said to be honest, I'm actually kind of happy it's happening because we need people that actually know what the hell they're talking about

27:24
to get our idiots to listen and quite frankly to put their thumb on their face and say this is what we're going to do

27:30
because this is what we need to do. So it's a very fine line, dude. It's such a double-edged sword. It's like oh

27:36
areas are gray. It's not black and white, right? And so, you know, this is kind of my way of saying like if you saw that post of mine, this is my way of saying

27:42
like, hey, there's, you know, there's more to it. And that that opinion actually kind of shoot I don't know because I I

27:49
understand the importance of needing to inform quote unquote boomers of

27:55
of what's that right there, what you just did, that is the mark of someone that you can have a conversation with,

28:00
undefined

28:00
someone who's here to seek the truth, someone who's here to learn, someone who's here to actually just like be a human. Yeah. And there's the people that can't

28:08
hear hear a different opinion and change their mind and admit fault and like be like, "Maybe I got that wrong. I don't know." Yeah, that's a huge red flag. Um,

28:15
yeah, but your buddy's right and and you're right. It's so complicated

28:20
because there's a huge faction on on X on the internet that's like all the

28:26
technocracy is bad. Yep. And they're right. It's [¬†__¬†] Yeah. But at the same time, we are going down

28:33
the tech road whether we like it or not. Yes. And like so I'm actually preparing

28:38
an episode and a talk in Boise um all about robots, tech, AI, the whole shebang right now happening next week.

28:46
And like for example, LA yesterday I was doing a whole bunch of research into drone swarms into how small is the

28:51
smallest drones that we know of right now. How small are the drones that DARP is developing? What technologies can they So, right now DARPA,

28:58
I'm sure there's a lot more classified stuff, but you can look up the DARPA mosquito

29:04
drone. I heard about that. That looks like a mosquito that has a little stinger. Yep. Um, drone swarms can now autonomously

29:10
fly through forests at high speeds and figure out the trees on their own. They can you can have swarms of like

29:15
thousands of drones working together. Um, and that's just drones. And not to

29:21
me, like and we've seen drones used in warfare, but Much of what's going on in Ukraine right now is drone warfare. I mean, the videos you see on Instagram

29:27
that pop up are drones. Dude, I saw a video. I saw a video the other day. I It's wild to me that we can even see

29:33
this kind of stuff without being on like rotten.com. You remember that? I do actually. We were kids. Rotten.com. Well, now it's

29:39
just the social media. But I saw a video that was literally point of view. One

29:44
guy riding on a motorcycle with another guy like a moped or something. Drone took the guy out in front of him. Literally sawed him in half.

29:50
Yeah. Right there. And like you see it all. Yeah. And it's like dude, it's scary.

29:57
And that's just one of these technologies. Like drones are an existential threat technology. AI obviously, not only is it an existential

30:04
threat technologies nation to nation, but it's an existential threat technology to humankind. Um then there's quantum computing, existential threat

30:10
technology to mankind. Um not to mention nation to nation. And there's this whole weird rabbit hole conspiracy theory

30:16
where apparently Google recently shut down their new quantum computer chip. And there's some hush hush rumors about

30:23
why that might have been very heavy stuff whole thing. But then there's like so many other layers like robotics,

30:29
prosthetics, uh like um it's kind of and obviously digital surveillance, digital mass surveillance

30:35
and um which they're already using by the way in the Gaza Strip. But so for so like hor yeah like all

30:42
these like yes there's lots of issues but also you can't ignore them to bury your head in the sand and pretend they don't exist.

30:48
And a good example is we're talking about Twitter and we're talking about all these bots, right? And how do you

30:53
know what's true? We didn't even talk about AI video and AI video like right now to like right now I can clone myself

30:59
AI video and audio and I can make a clone that my parents would not be able to tell the difference of between me and it

31:05
that destroys the truth. There is no more truth. Give it one year. There's no more truth. And the only solution to

31:10
that is some way to verify that you're a real human and that that's a digital ID. And so suddenly you're back at the

31:16
digital mass which is horrible. It's like there's no good answer. But at the same time it's like what

31:21
else? Yeah. So that I actually I've been going pretty hard on AI for the last few weeks too because I don't see other than

31:28
the issue of what's going on in the Middle East and what's going on with the AI race right now. I don't see anything else that's more important to talk

31:33
about. Like it's crazy because especially with AI. So, um I don't know

31:39
if you have seen everything about the like have you seen the what the CEOs

31:44
have been saying about it and everything as far as like I can't remember who it was. I think it was Yeah, one of them just like tried to

31:50
blackmail one of its hand like one of its programmers. Yeah. Right. Um it wasn't Bard, it was uh it

31:56
was it'll come to me later. But not even just that, like did you hear what um I think it was the I want

32:00
undefined

32:04
to say it was the former CEO of the Google, but I'm not sure. I don't want to I don't want to like don't quote me. One of them though, one of the one of

32:10
the former guys said that if you want to imagine what AI is years like a couple

32:16
years from now, a few years from now, he basically said when we go from AI to AGI, right, which is the difference is

32:23
right now AI is just pulling information that already exists based on prompts. AGI is it's creating knowledge based on

32:30
the knowledge that exists, but it's literally thinking. He said when we go from that to that he said the best way

32:36
to explain what the world looks like is imagine that the scarcity of knowledge

32:41
no longer exists right now everything as far as value goes we value knowledge

32:47
ultimately knowledge is what creates money creates all that like you that's that's the that's the main generator of

32:53
any wealth you know is is more knowledge than other people knowledge creates skills right what all

32:59
falls into it or investment strategies or business plans Exactly. But you have to have the knowledge to be able to do it, right? Someone does. So what he said was

33:06
imagine a world where that no longer is scarce. That everyone has access to the same amount of knowledge across the

33:12
board. And he said what is valuable? And then to go to your point now imagine that

33:20
truth no longer exists either. So there's no more value of knowledge because there's no scarcity of knowledge. Everybody has access to

33:26
anything they want to know at any time. But then on top of that, there's no truth because nobody knows what's real

33:32
and what's not. What is valuable? And what do you do? And here's what here's my my conspiracy and my hypothesis.

33:40
Okay, you ready? I think we are ushering in an era where there's going to be

33:45
class systems based on knowledge and not money. And I think that the people who ultimately control the knowledge are

33:52
going to be the ones that quote unquote become the new dictators.

33:58
And that is the tech lords. As in everyone lives in a false reality, different layers, different different

34:03
customtailored more knowledge you have. More knowledge you have, the higher class you are, the more opportunity. Yep. And and the

34:09
people that are willing to tow the line and say the things that they deem okay.

34:15
Right. This is total 1984 stuff, but dude, I that's where I see it going. I mean I think that I would challenge

34:21
someone to debate you to to argue that we haven't already lived in that system for

34:26
at least 100 years but now I think it's going to become visible and well it can become codified in the

34:33
entire information space that is shared I mean so before it was codified in books and in what's published and in

34:38
what's taught in universities and in all these classical media but then internet started to break that open y

34:44
but the moment like we're at this critical turning point where if you can get control over the AI the internet and

34:49
you don't have to necessarily control everything. You just have to make it confusing as [¬†__¬†] Like make it all just a a mass of misleading garbage fluff,

34:59
whatever it is. That's right. Um and yeah, you can stratify the truth into nothingness because what is the

35:04
truth? Like who knows what the truth is? The truth is just, you know, are you a boy or a girl? No one knows. Well, and

35:11
yeah, and see that's the thing. And that's that. So that's what I'm that's what I'm saying is I can see them creating this system where it's like

35:17
based on the amount of knowledge you have that they allow you to have determines whether or not like

35:23
determines what you can and can't have and can and can't say and can and can't do in the world. The thing is I don't know if they can

35:28
pull it off because the technology is already decentralized enough like you have to lock down that kid in in Mumbai

35:36
that knows how to program an an AI on his own. You have to lock down the kid in Sydney, Australia. you have to lock

35:41
down the Korean hacker like it's a language it's a code everyone can do these things like yes to train large AI

35:47
models to have like quantum computing these things are you know huge barriers to entry but um ultimately the barriers

35:56
are already fluid enough that I I I feel like there is a w I mean I'm not saying it

36:00
undefined

36:02
can't happen but there's a wide open playing field and I think it empowers the little guy more than it disempowers

36:08
us at this moment at this moment to a certain degree I don't disagree. I think at this moment it definitely does. I mean, there's they're they're saying

36:14
that within the next year or two you'll have people that have PhD level knowledge and never having gone to

36:20
school. So, I think you already do, honestly. Yeah. And I and I So, I get that, but I think it will get to a point where it's

36:26
so out of hand. And again, man, I've said this so many times. Once someone has all the money and all the power in

36:32
the world, there's only one more thing that they can possibly get that levels them up, and that's control. Yeah.

36:38
And the same amount of control that they want over the money system and over what people do because of how much money they have, I think it's going to get to a

36:44
point where they want control over how much knowledge you have and what you're able to do because of it. Well, I would argue that they've you

36:50
think they've already done that. Oh, for sure. Yeah, for sure. I mean, think about the narratives that we aren't allowed to talk about. Think

36:56
about the things that we can't touch and think about how long it's been that way. And think about what the response is when you talk about the things that

37:02
you're we're not supposed to talk about. Fair enough. But they can't exactly switch off your They can't switch off

37:07
the truth anymore. But I mean, I'm sorry. I'm saying like they can't really like this goes into like the whole idea of smart cities and

37:14
things like that, right? When it gets to a point where everything is on a switch, they don't quite have the right they don't have quite they don't have the

37:20
ability to do that yet. They can mess with you, but they're trying to build it. So, that's what my point is is like

37:25
if it gets to a point where they do control the amount of knowledge real time. Yeah. I'm not saying knowledge from past or

37:31
anything. I'm saying like real-time knowledge and your ability to do or say things by just flipping a switch. That's

37:37
where I think it's headed. But then again, that's where they want it to go for sure. Well, yeah. And we need to fight that with

37:42
everything we've got. Um hopefully. And and that sort of is like the the head

37:48
like the higher level um issue that a lot of us are taking with digital ID,

37:54
with digital mass surveillance, with all of these systems uh CBDC's because it's such a slippery slope. And yeah, damn straight. oppose that

38:00
till the day we die. Yeah. But there is all like the unfortunate double side of the coin that like and and I think that this will probably get

38:06
spun on the internet of like Ian's control opposition because he's argue like he's saying we should have CBD. No, if you want to argue against a point,

38:13
you have to have a counterargument to their legitimate points. Yes. Right. And so their legitimate point is that when

38:20
you get that AI smart enough, what's going to stop the kid in Mumbai,

38:26
the kid in Iran? just to use the talking point the kid wherever from asking it how to make a biological

38:33
weapon right from asking it how to create you know an incend whatever an EMP device or like target that one thing

38:40
you know these the technological uh gateway is opening wide up to we have no

38:47
idea what well and that's why it's so scary to think of what like I think it was Elon

38:53
that actually said he told uh another one of the executives in the AI companies I wish I knew all these names.

38:59
I This is why you need to pull stuff up, but anyway, um he basically said, and we

39:04
could probably roll a clip in this, but he said, "Imagine the relation or or just picture the relationship with a

39:10
human and a dog." And he said, "AI is the human and we are the dogs." He said, "10 years from now."

39:15
Yeah. And like when you really think about that, you know, it again it opens up

39:21
everything so wide because there's so much nuance to it because it's like you said,

39:26
we are going in that direction. No matter what we do, Pandora's box is open. It doesn't matter what we do

39:31
because now the world powers are in a race for it. Yeah. So, no matter what we do as civilians, it doesn't matter they're not shutting

39:37
AI down. It's coming and it's going to be the I think it's going to be the greatest disruptor than we've ever

39:44
experienced as as a human race. Absolutely. It's a literal arms race. Yes. And so, it's like we want to be the

39:52
ones that actually figure it out faster, but then on top of that, it's like that comes with a price. And the price is

39:57
that Trump currently has in his ear all the top tech executives that are leading the charge whispering really big numbers

40:04
and really fancy things about Golden Domes and stuff. And that is Larry Ellison, Sam Alman, uh Sergey Brin,

40:10
Peter Teal. Peter Teal, Elon Musk. And these are not good dudes. Yeah. Did you see the interview with

40:15
Peter Teal? Oh yeah. Do you think the human race should endure

40:22
processing? But who lets that dude out of his cell? Like who lets him out of his cell?

40:28
First of all, who gives these people the ability to think about whether or not

40:33
the human race should evolve or should endure? Endure. I'm sorry. I'm sure that he defers to Israel on

40:38
that point because that is Peter Teal's perspective on anything sketchy. But like, bro, if you go watch it's it's

40:45
like literally it was like his brain started like malfunctioning. It was like the loading screen every time. Anytime there's a hard

40:50
question, he just short. It reminded me of Zuckerberg. Honestly, it reminded me of anytime I've listened to Zuckerberg in an interview. Update the operating system, dude.

40:57
Seriously, dude, because or punch him in the face. I mean, I'm not advocating for that. I'm just making a joke. When I first heard that interview,

41:00
undefined

41:04
I kind of had to take a double take. I was like, is this real? Like, is this guy a robot? I mean, it how would we know?

41:11
Seriously, there is anyway. But yeah, like I I just couldn't believe what I was listening to. And so, to your point,

41:16
yeah, he's got So, so let me ask you this. This is kind of a deep question. um especially given all the all what's

41:23
going on right now. Your opinion on whether or not Trump is actually

41:29
controlled or do you think he really is just ignorant enough that he is sucking

41:34
up like cuz we know I we all know he is a freaking eggoomaniac. He loves to hear his own voice. He loves to hear his

41:40
name. It's just how Trump is. And everybody that knows Trump, by the way, will say that. I mean that's how he got where he is.

41:46
Essential quality for the man. Yes. And and honestly, that's why a lot of people like him, too. Yeah. So, I'm not dogging on him for that.

41:53
Like, that it is what it is. But what I'm saying is, do you think that it's more probable that he's controlled by

42:00
Israel, by whatever, or do you think it's more probable that he's just being heavily heavily influenced by the people

42:06
who are and he's making I think the latter. Personally, right now, I lean towards the latter. And

42:11
obviously, I could be wrong, but um I wanted to hope that there was some grand plan. Like I wanted to hope that at

42:17
least he had America's interest at heart and first and that he would release files and all this garbage that clearly

42:23
is not happening, dude. Um and the evidence showed that a lot of us were too hopeful. Um myself included,

42:28
although I was never quite all the way down the bandwagon, but um now what we've seen is to me it looks to me like

42:36
he uh it doesn't I I don't think that he's blackmailed by the Epstein tapes

42:42
personally. You don't? I I don't think so. I um and and if he is,

42:49
it would it would be far more complex than like,

42:55
how do you say this? Um a lot of people have a very simplistic perspective on blackmail. They think it's like, oh,

43:01
you're on the tape. Oh, they own everything you do. That's never been how blackmail works. Bill Clinton was blackmailed by the explain that more.

43:07
So, explain that for just the average. Well, think of it. Do a thought experiment for yourself.

43:12
Suppose that you've spent billions of dollar and I'm not speaking specifically about Trump here. I'm just speaking about blackmail in general. Suppose you

43:18
spend years of your life and all the money you have and everything setting up this crazy operation to blackmail all the teachers in your school, right? And

43:25
then one of the teachers gives you a bad grade, right? And you're like, I give me an A. I want an A. And that teacher is

43:32
like, no. And you say, well, I've got all this black blackmail on you. They're like, yeah, I don't care. What do you

43:38
do? Because if you expose the blackmail on this teacher in this hypothetical situation,

43:44
you risk exposing your whole blackmail operation. You risk playing all the cards, right? It's like, what do you do? Yeah.

43:50
Cuz you don't want to play your whole hand, right? Because the other teachers were skil were giving you A's because they were scared. But then this [¬†__¬†] is not

43:55
scared all of a sudden. So what do you do? And we we kind of know for sure that Bill Clinton did this to BB. Bill

44:03
Clinton had Jonathan Pard, one of the most egregious intelligence leaks in American history, in prison. And BB

44:10
Netanyahu wanted him free and extradited to Israel, so he would not talk. Whatever. I don't know. And

44:17
we all know that Bill Clinton flew on the plane a lot. That Jeffrey Epste went to the Oh, dude, we know Bill Clinton was one

44:23
time. It's wild that that guy's even walking free right now. It's insane. But none of that ever came out cuz Bill

44:28
Clinton also presided over the Oslo, of course. Well, it came out, but nobody did anything about it. Bill Clinton stuff about him being on

44:34
Epste and everything. Well, well, but here's the thing is that that came out later with all the FC that

44:41
came out when Epste got caught. At the time, Bill Clinton was was brokering peace in the Middle East, which the

44:46
Israelis literally killed their own prime minister for doing. And then, well, like, you know, who knows who

44:52
which Israelis were behind it, but it was an Israeli that shot him. Yeah. Um, and he had Jonathan Pard going on.

44:58
So there's these are two things that the Israeli deep state and government and Netanyahu's government at the time

45:03
deeply did not like and we know that the FC network had their claws in it. But what actually happened? This Monica

45:09
Lewinsky scandal happened, right? Yep. And that is a lot more like a warning shot. That's a contained episode that

45:16
that's easy to explain it as like, oh, it's just this one little scandal, just this one little thing. It's not like

45:21
we're sexually blackmailing uh like, you know, 90% of American politicians or anything like that. That's just Bill

45:26
Clinton stuck his willie like put a cigar in her butt or whatever it is. I don't know.

45:32
Crazy story. Um, yeah. Wait, wait, hold on. Yeah, there's a real I don't think it

45:39
was her butt, but yeah, look up Bill Clinton's cigar Monica Lewinsky. There's a whole thing. They got all

45:44
these weird stories coming out. And there is reporting in the Times of Israel that BB Netanyahu acquired

45:51
somehow 30 hours of phone sex from tapped phones in the White House of Bill

45:56
Clinton having phone sex with Monica Lewinsky. And he tried and in the Times of Israel, it says that he allegedly

46:02
tried to blackmail Bill Clinton with those 30 hours of phone sex conversations to get him to release

46:07
Jonathan Pid, which Bill still did not do, right? But then the whole scandal kind of broke and it like it really tarnished

46:13
Bill's career and it almost brought him down sort of maybe but it didn't expose the whole FC network. So right you're in their school you blackmailed all your

46:19
teachers and this one [¬†__¬†] teacher won't give you an A. How do you actually leverage your blackmail to like get this

46:25
upstart? You got to work the other people the other day. Then you have to think about how much more complicated it gets because in this case like Trump very well could be a

46:32
black mailer as well. He very well could have blackmail himself. He's been in the he's like 80 years old almost. He grew

46:37
up around Roy Conn. He owned the Plaza Hotel. He owned a non Koshogi's boat. He's been wheeling and dealing with all

46:43
these dudes his whole life. Well, see, and that's why, okay, so that's why I tend to agree with you as far as the I don't think I don't I don't

46:50
know if he's necessarily compromised himself or if it's more the people around him. Because in my mind I'm like,

46:56
dude, the amount of people that Trump was around, the amount of times that he

47:02
could have put himself in a compromising situation, it's like you would imagine that someone like Trump is smart enough

47:07
to just say, "If I really want what's on that island, I can do it in my penthouse and nobody knows a damn thing about it." Especially because he was raised by Roy

47:14
Con. Yes. Instead of putting himself in compromising situation because Roy was an expert of not putting yourself in

47:19
compromising the head of the FBI. Yeah. He knew exactly where to put

47:25
people to compromise them. And so having that guy as your confidant and knowing that like

47:31
and Trump doesn't drink, he doesn't smoke, he doesn't drugs. Yeah. So it just doesn't make sense that someone like Trump would put himself in

47:36
that situation and that's why it's more like believable that he's just being influenced by the people around him. So

47:42
but you know what he is is he he loves to make a deal. He likes big numbers. He's not terribly smart in the like

47:49
intellectual I'm not 80 years old way. like he's an old boomer that loves his

47:55
hair and his deals and his family and his legacy. And that kind of a guy is really easy for Larry Ellison or Sam

48:02
Alman or Peter Teal to come up to and be like, "Hey, listen. Listen, man. This AI stuff, it's going to destroy our

48:08
country, but we but we can be the best. We're going to put a hundred million dollars. Like, we're going to be the best in the world. America's going to be

48:13
number one. We're going to obliterate them all. They'll have like you can just wow him with numbers and programs and policies and like he

48:19
and all he cares about is being the best." Exactly. He's not talking about what digital mass surveillance is going to do to your rights or to like American

48:26
sovereignty. But see, that's the that's such the the the interesting piece of all this because when you get in conversations

48:32
with people that are for that are like for example QAnon or or any of the people that are like trust the plan people, they believe that this man is

48:39
like omnipotent. Like he knows everything. He's be he's in front of everything. And I'm over here and I'm just like guys, I don't even think he

48:46
understands the history of the Israel Palestinian conflict. Oh, I doubt it. I don't I think he I think he is just like every other boomer

48:53
who has been completely propagandized from day one and he truly does believe that they are our greatest ally and he

48:59
truly does believe that there's a black and white answer to this. I I don't think he believes that they're our greatest ally and that's because

49:05
he's been dealing with BB and the way he dealt with the Iran conflict prior is really interesting. No, probably not.

49:12
Still I think I think prior he probably had less knowledge, right? Because like why did you know so he's in real estate,

49:18
right? Yeah, he's done all kinds of real estate deals with Jews and with Israelis and with Zionists and everybody, right? Like

49:23
Jared Kushner's in his family. He's like the Ads are donating to him like crazy. Like the the Israel lobby, if they know

49:30
one thing, it's they know how to give a lot of money to people that are going to have or do have power. And you know,

49:35
Trump is going to love those people. They're and and like and a lot of them, if they're treating you nicely and not genociding you, then they're are great

49:42
people. I'm sure I'm sure they're wonderful, friendly But you're with me in believing that like I really don't

49:47
think he understands the conflict. I don't think he has any idea about Blefor any of that stuff. I I think he's probably learning more

49:53
and more now because a it's all over the internet. Um a I know dude when you

49:59
ratio Elon it's like how does Elon not know that exactly? Well, I mean, most people don't and it takes a lot of time to learn and

50:06
but then in dealing with them, like once Elon gets forced onto his like apology like Awitz tour, I'm sure he learned a

50:13
lot about it then, even if his hands are tied. And then Trump with the Iran deal, it's clear that Trump now understands BB

50:19
in a different way. And I've got to say, um, I am very happy with how like I

50:25
would have loved a different outcome entirely Israel, but yeah, it could have been so

50:31
much worse. It's not necessarily over. I am still concerned that either there's

50:36
plans being played out or Israel is going to try to drag us back in or there's going to be a terror attack that is obviously done by Iran. Um but so I'm

50:45
I'm worried still. But the way that Trump dealt with it where he gave Israel a symbolic win like like see we blew up

50:52
their nuclear program for you. You're welcome. Yeah. And he gave but he also saved their asses because Israel

50:58
was screwed because they had started something that they could not finish. And they he also gave Iran a symbolic

51:03
win by like it kind of sounds like they probably got most of the fizzle material out as far as I can tell and like yes

51:08
sort of didn't really take any like serious in that way. I will say that I kind of believe the whole idea of like I mean

51:14
dude this is one thing I do know about Trump. He is a freaking smart businessman. He's definitely smart there. I mean that's one of the reasons I voted for

51:20
him. So like as far as the art of the deal stuff goes I think he does I think he is doing a fairly good job as far as

51:27
that goes. That being said, he sent like like like billions more dollars to Israel and

51:32
weapons right afterwards. So yeah, and that's so that's the part that like it's just it's so hard to

51:38
understand and so hard to decipher because I swear every time I turn around I'm like okay that was a good move he

51:43
made and then it's like wait a second why did he do that? Like okay you did a good thing here but then why the hell

51:49
did you do this? And that's what makes me think that it's not so much him as much as it is the people around him. And

51:56
it's almost like the decisions that he's making that I agree with, it's like, oh, that was Trump. Yeah.

52:00
undefined

52:01
Like that was Trump. That was the Trump I voted for. Yeah. But then the next decision that's made where it's like, no, no, no, no, no.

52:07
That's not America first. That's not us. That wasn't Trump. So, I have a kind of hot take that's going to be probably

52:13
really unpopular and misinterpreted a lot, but it kind of crystallized for me just now. And this is very uh this is a

52:20
very vague idea, but I feel like everyone that's trying to figure out what's going on right now, all the journalists, all the truth seekers, all

52:26
the conspiracy theorists, all the everyone. We're arriving at wildly different takes

52:33
because there's something missing. Like there is a piece of this puzzle that is missing. And to some people it's the

52:39
Illuminati running the world and they've got this like conspiracy that's like at the top. To some people it's just the

52:44
bankers, the BIS, the Federal Reserve, and they're the ones really pulling the strings. And to some people it's the

52:50
aliens. Like to some people it's Q. To some people it's, you know, the like

52:57
Satanist sex cult that's like blackmailing. There's all the to some people it's the Jews, right? Like there's all these different versions of

53:03
that missing link that explains everything behind the scenes because in their mind in their mind, right? Because if you

53:09
don't have something missing that explains everything. No, what I mean is that it doesn't add up. What we're

53:15
seeing in the public square does not make sense at all. Very confusing, right? Like the way that Trump came in being who he was and then doing all the

53:23
deals he's done and like pushing the big beautiful bill and all and like and bombing Iran and appeasing Israel and

53:28
doing the job, it really does not make sense. Um, and like like yeah, it it can

53:35
make sense if everyone is just evil and greedy and corrupted and and blackmailing each other and but like it

53:40
would make more sense what I'm saying if there was a missing piece of information

53:45
that was not public information and as an example if aliens were real and they were here and

53:53
they were working with US government and there was some sort of technology and there was like and I'm this is purely hypothetical but suppose there's aliens

53:59
that we aren't told about that are working with our government. There's aliens that are working with the Chinese government and there's an arms race with

54:04
alien tech going on right now that we don't know about. Two different species. Suddenly that would explain why the [¬†__¬†]

54:11
we're doing this with our dollar, why we're doing with this with our budget, why we're putting infinite spending towards war beyond just like the regular

54:17
militaries. Like why everyone can be corrupted? Like what I'm saying is that and I'm not saying I think that's true.

54:22
I'm saying that I suspect there are civilization altering missing pieces

54:29
whether it's AGI or uh UAPs and aliens or it's like literally a global cult

54:35
conspiracy that's like the black mailers are all one big like religious cult. Whatever that missing piece or multiple

54:41
pieces is, I suspect that that is the thing missing from all of our causing

54:46
all the confusion because it does not make sense how much like it makes sense how Israel could get

54:51
so much influence over the US and have the Epstein network running and get so much money. But it doesn't really make sense that

54:58
Trump would torpedo his own reputation around illegal immigration, right? and

55:00
undefined

55:03
around like not starting wars and around like over and over people get into power

55:09
and then kind of change their tune. um which is corruption. But I just I wonder because we're at

55:15
this precipice where we know of several potential civilization changing conspiracies and just the three that I

55:22
mentioned. Possibly there's aliens, possibly there's AGI stuff, possibly there is a global conspiracy of

55:29
organized crime that is blackmailing everyone/cult. Interesting. Any of those would

55:34
Do you believe in aliens? I think they're more likely than not. I I agree. I Here's the thing, though. I

55:40
don't think that they're what the movies portray. I think the movies are just portraying what they want us to think. I think it just from my I'll even just say from

55:47
my own religious belief. I believe they're just like us. I I I truly believe that everybody's made in God's

55:53
image. I believe in God, you know, whether whether people do or not, like that's what I believe. And so because of that, I believe everybody's

55:59
made in his image. But at the same time, you know, uh people look different. Like different races look different, right?

56:06
So, what's to say that this is just the aliens are not just other races from other planets, but they just look

56:11
different? I mean, maybe their ears are smaller, maybe their noses are smaller set, like whatever it may be because of that's how

56:18
they survived on their planet, right? But I don't think that it's like monsters. I think that they're probably

56:24
just beings like us, but at the same time, I think that they're probably susceptible to the same qualities and

56:31
the same intentions and the same desires that we have. And so the idea that they could be nefarious or the idea that they

56:37
could be a waring nation, right, is not far-fetched. And the idea that they're

56:42
not is not farfetched. It's almost impossible to know. But I believe they're here. Yeah. And and I think that we've been

56:48
led to believe in this model of like they got on a spaceship on a far away planet and then they flew through outer

56:54
space to get here and all of this stuff. Even the like there's a lot of fake disclosure and alien misinformation.

57:00
Tons of it. Watch out for it. Um that said,

57:05
it's all pointing to interdimensionality. Yeah. And traversing like dimensions, traversing like realms. Yeah. Like those

57:13
sorts of things. Um that is fascinating to speculate on to ask questions about

57:18
and we don't know. Like it could be that some of them are beings of light and that they're like literally orbs. It could be that some of them are

57:24
shapeshifting like just can take our form. It could be that some of them are reptilian. could be like we don't know,

57:30
right? Um David Ike is gonna hate me for saying that they could be reptilian. Love you, David. Dude, like we don't know.

57:36
You and David are so funny. Well, I mean to be fair, I've I've believed this for years. I just poke back at him because he pokes me so much.

57:41
Yeah. But um like that's the cool thing about the alien question is that the the Fairmy paradox, if you're not familiar,

57:48
it's the paradox of of why aren't they here? Because there's if science is

57:54
right, then there's billions of stars out there. Billions and billions and billions And like if only if any one of those

58:01
planets had a civilization just 10,000 years ahead of us, Lord knows where their technology would be, right?

58:07
And it also leads to the question of why we're not there. And I will tell you that from the long for the longest time,

58:12
this is one of those conspiracy theories I don't think you can talk me out of, which is I do believe that we left the

58:18
planet at some point. I believe we got turned the hell around. I believe we got there and they were like, "You go back

58:25
and you never say a word again or we will wipe you out." Interesting. Because I believe that there's an

58:31
absolute possibility that the moon or whatever is actually potentially a

58:37
intergalactic The moon is weird station. I I think I think it's I think it is potentially an intergalactic

58:43
station. You look at it. You look into all the craters and all these different things and how they're perfectly round and like you look into uh some of the

58:49
things about the sound that it makes when you hit it and like all kinds of different things. Scientists were trying to figure out if it's hollow or not.

58:55
There is an absolute there. It's not I don't know what it is. I absolutely believe in it. I absolutely believe that there's there's the

59:01
possibility that we saw something that we were not supposed to and that we got turned around and and I'm not even

59:08
saying this is like when we went to the moon back in whenever was that cuz that I don't believe that I believe was staged. But I do believe that we've

59:14
gotten to the point where now we can send things there. And I think we got turned around. And I think that's the

59:19
reason why space travel has been so weird. And it's I could believe it. Like I just I don't know. I I think uh I

59:27
think that's why we're cuz to your point, why are they not here? Why are we not there? Well, another possibility sort of the

59:35
same possibility in a certain way is you're never going to get there flying in a ship.

59:40
Yeah. you it will take you that. So if you fly at light speed, think about how

59:46
many light years away the nearest your stuff is, right? And so even if you're at light speed, it's that many years away.

59:51
Unless it's the moon, thousands of years, unless Well, yeah, the moon is right here. But what I'm saying is that in order for us to visit

59:56
other star systems and other alien planets, right? Y you're never going to do it in a ship. It's going to be interdimensional. So it's very understandable why we are not

60:03
there because we're thinking about flying in ships. Um it's very possible that they're here and that's kind of what we're all

60:08
wondering right now and why aren't we here? But it also brings up the other question and this is built in baked into

60:14
the fmy paradox and it's called the great filter or a great filter as in the the question inherently leads you to ask

60:21
is there some reason why civilizations never evolve to be intergalactic. Is there a reason why the technological

60:27
advancement to become space fairing civilizations inherently leads to your own self-destruction or well I was going

60:33
to say or did we and did we go backwards because that's also so anytime that Joe Rogan has people on where they talk

60:39
about the what is it called Tartar. Oh, Tartaria. Tartaria. Anytime that that uh idea comes up where

60:46
it's like we were once a very very advanced civilization because of alien influence, but

60:51
something happened that sent us basically back to the stone age and then we continued to progress to where we are

60:57
now. I don't know if that's for me that's not hard to believe. For me, it's not hard

61:02
to believe that we could have advanced that far or been given that knowledge from someone and figured it out because

61:08
dude, I mean like like he always goes into the pyramids and all these other things. It's like it doesn't make any sense. Well, you know what the younger Dryass

61:14
impact hypothesis? No, please. So, this is what Graz D R Y A S impact hypothesis. And Graham

61:21
Hancock is one of the most prominent speakers about this, but it's not his theory. This is a theory that Yeah.

61:26
Yeah. Several of them. And this is the theory that it's like it's composited from the work of hundreds of scientists

61:31
around the world and it has lots of different evidence that basically uh compiles to to hypothesize that during

61:39
the last ice age a piece of a comet probably the um uh the torid meteor

61:46
stream which we pass through twice a year. A large piece of this comet

61:51
probably broke off and slammed into the Laurentide ice sheet, which is the ice sheet above North America, Greenland,

61:56
and maybe Russia a little bit. Um, somewhere around 12,900 years ago, and caused a massive meltoff, massive just

62:00
undefined

62:04
like global like what the [¬†__¬†] Um, wiped out all the megapa and megaplora like America used to be covered in giant

62:10
ground sloths. You know about those guys, dude? Giant ground sloths were as tall as this room. They were like 18 foot

62:16
tall sloths that walked all around the Americas. Get this. This is my favorite factoid. Wait, this is real.

62:21
This is real. You can look them up. Really? Yeah. Look up giant ground sloth. They're lots of evidence. All

62:27
kinds of stuff. And they look just like a regular sloth. Uh, sort of. They looked like a really tall kind of like anteater with a

62:32
shorter nose and they would stand on two feet. And here's total sidetrack. Avocados are a fruit, right?

62:38
Yeah. So avocados are a fruit. Fruit evolved for the seeds to be eaten by an animal

62:43
and pooped out somewhere, right? Okay. Right. Like fruit are supposed to be pooped. You poop out the seeds. Avocados

62:49
are a fruit. Who the hell is pooping out an avocado pit? [¬†__¬†] no one. And the reason is

62:55
because avocados are what are called megaplora. Because avocados evolved alongside mega fauna. Because avocados

63:01
were the primary food source of giant ground sloths and all these other giant mammals that live in North America. And

63:07
that's why avocados have such a big pit because giant ground sloths were like 18 foot tall sloths that walked around that

63:12
had basically no predators and they just like ate avocados all day and pooped out avocado pits like they were little like grape seeds

63:18
and these giant ground sloths and like where did you learn this? It's all over the internet. You can just learn you can just look it all up. So

63:24
when you start looking into the younger destact hypothesis you look into the the last ice age you look into what actually

63:30
the Americas were like during that time. short-nosed bears, like massive, bigger than grizzly bears. Saber-tooth tigers,

63:37
deadly. Uh, like just all these like buffaloos and crazy animals that were all over this continent. Mammoths, you

63:44
know, all of them go extinct all at once. Well, that's way back. Yeah. Well, I was going to say, but they

63:50
also went extinct. the like classical explanation that that mainstream science gives for all of these animals,

63:57
including saber-tooth tigers, short-nosed bears, and all these really gnarly predators. They say that humans

64:04
that the ice started to melt slowly, and the humans crossed from Russia, came down into the Americas, and then the

64:09
humans with sticks and stones, literally, no iron, no metal, just sticks and stones, hunted all of the

64:15
giant ground slaws, woolly mammoths, short-nosed bears, saber-tooth tigers. They hunted them all to death. Just like

64:21
that. This is like, are you [¬†__¬†] Like, are you [¬†__¬†] How many grizzly

64:28
bears and cougars and deer and elk are still around? And there's we're clearly

64:33
better at hunting now. Like, clearly that's not what happened. And there's also all this there's all kinds of other evidence like there's a black matte

64:40
layer that shows nano diamond sphirerals all across the world that like basically there's a lot of evidence that a comet

64:46
hit America 12,900 years ago and caused this crazy [¬†__¬†] flood almost like a

64:53
great flood and wiped out a shitload of flora and fauna in the way that would

64:58
also destroy a human civilization. Maybe even carve out like some canyons like the Grand Canyon, stuff like that. And

65:04
you would wind up with a lot of the the the building blocks of a lot of these

65:09
ancient um interesting ancient civilization conspiracy theories. Interesting. I dig that [¬†__¬†] It's fascinating.

65:16
It's super fun. I I mean, I like how we went from we went from Clinton to Trump

65:21
to Epstein to aliens to I mean, this is why it's fun, dude. This is why it's always fun to get. But no, it does beg

65:27
the question though, like what is that missing piece? And for me,

65:33
dude, I don't know. For me, the could be more than one, too. Yeah. And that's the thing, but for me, the missing piece has always been the

65:38
Epstein client list. Like, dude, I got that's missing for sure. But I mean, look, like it's as you know,

65:43
as cliche as that sounds, as simple as beating the dead horse is, but like to me it's very simple.

65:49
We know that the man trafficked women and kids on that island to highle elites

65:56
for decades. We know it. It's not a question. Not just on that island. Not just on that island, all over the

66:02
world. We know that it happened and we know that highle people were involved. Yeah.

66:08
And we still don't know who the people were that traffic to it. And the only thing that I can come up with is anybody

66:15
and everybody who is hiding it is on it. It's the only like I just I can't see.

66:20
And then the other thing too, let me ask you what you think about this one. Matt Gates. Oh, I wish that we had him instead of

66:26
Pam Bondi. Holy [¬†__¬†] So do you think Matt Gates was the key? Do you think because the way I look at Matt Gates very similar to Julian

66:33
Assange? Yeah. Look at how that all happened, right? What was it? It was sexual scandal. Yeah.

66:39
That's what ruined it. Completely. When you really dig out, it was very fabricated. Very artificial,

66:45
but it was enough came out of nowhere. It was enough to get him ousted. Y and it was enough to put Julian in a hole.

66:50
Y And so I just look at that and I'm like I don't know how else you can look at

66:55
those two situations and say that's what they did to Julian. I was so they perfected it and that's what they've done for me.

67:01
Bondi is such a ladder climber. She's such a controllable like pawn of a person. I didn't know much about her

67:07
when she first came in, but like oh boy, it's a lot. And you listen to what Matt is saying now and you're like, "Oh, okay. That's

67:12
why you're not there." Dude, imagine if that dude was 18. Oh my god. Imagine. Yeah. So to me, I'm like, he's saying

67:20
what he's saying and he's been ousted. And then on top of that, we still don't have that list. We still don't have the

67:26
files. They keep on giving us the runaround. They do the the gay binder thing with the conservative with with

67:32
con inc. Yeah. And and then on top of that, you know, you have So, let's dive into this

67:38
because I think this is something that a lot of people don't understand, including myself, and I would love for you to explain it because I believe that

67:45
the connection with Epstein and the blackmail operation, right, is paramount

67:52
to this, but so many people are so unaware of that. and you're the one that kind of turned me on to Whitney Webb.

67:57
Yeah, shout out Whitney. One Nation Under Blackmail. Two two volumes. Um, but they are so dense.

68:00
undefined

68:05
So dense. Yeah. Disclaimer to everyone. You got to read those books like two or three times to understand them.

68:10
But will you give like a highlevel breakdown of just help the average

68:15
person understand? I'll do my best. Whitney I'm sure hates every time I do this. You don't have to, but I just totally

68:21
will. There's so many people that don't understand even why it could be conceived as a blackmail operation.

68:26
Yeah, I know you can. Yeah. So, there's a couple different pieces and we kind of dig into each one as you

68:33
want. as in there's one line of reasoning of why is it that we that a lot of people suspect that he worked for

68:39
Israel primarily and then there's a different line of kind of like logic of why is it that we feel pretty confident

68:46
that he was blackmailing people and then there's a different line of logic of like how do we figure out who he was

68:52
targeting and what what the whole network So break down each one start with the first um

68:58
Jeffrey Epstein it might be easiest to start with him

69:03
blackmailing people. Okay. And that that's kind of straightforward honestly is that when he was finally

69:09
busted for real in 2019, they confiscated like they they actually

69:15
like tore apart his homes, confiscated boxes and boxes and boxes of tapes and they told us

69:20
that there were blackmail. They told us what they took and they told us that the that his properties were wired up with

69:26
cameras and they just told us explicitly that it was black male stuff. Right. Um, that's beyond the fact that he was put

69:33
into place and and and apparently trained by black mailers and people interested in blackmail, which is we'll

69:40
kind of come back through as we talk about who he worked for. But, uh, that

69:45
is no real like there there's not a lot of leaps in logic about him blackmailing

69:51
because they just straight up told us and then kind of memory hold it, right? Um but also when you look at who

69:56
he worked for, came up with was trained by you get even more confirmation that it was a blackmail operation.

70:01
Well, isn't it true that they also arrested him and then yes let him go and then he continued to

70:07
operate. So Epstein started to raise red flags in Palm Beach area in Florida in the 2000s.

70:13
Yes. Um, and because you know I I

70:20
I don't know for sure exactly which girls or women at the time like came

70:26
forward first, but there was a lot of suspicious activity. There was a lot of reports about girls coming going from

70:32
his place. He was having these underage girls, these like high schoolers and maybe even some middle schoolers. I think they're all high schoolers for the

70:38
most part. they were recruiting each other for him and then he would pay them to recruit each other. So that was kind

70:44
of getting out and it was kind of weird and some of them tried to raise alarms with like parents and teachers and some

70:50
to the cops and um and then this police

70:55
officer Joseph Kerry eventually got onto the case and actually started doing his job really well and he started following

71:03
all the leads and um and speaking to victims and accumulating testimony and he had a police chief whose name I

71:10
unfortunately forget that supported him and helped like try to bring it. And

71:15
when they finally brought the first charges against Jeffrey Epstein, it got squashed um at the uh state level

71:24
in Florida. And Pam Bondi was in the Florida state uh

71:31
I don't know if she was really she wasn't um she wasn't the AG at the

71:36
time of Florida. She might have been. I don't know exactly what her position was, but she was there.

71:41
What year was it? Um, this is his his plea deal in 2009, I believe, is when it was finalized. Um, and Alex Aosta gave

71:51
this famous quote, and I'm pretty sure that he was the AG of uh the Florida AG at the time. Um, and his quote was

71:58
because he he gave him this crazy uh like sweetheart plea deal, prosecutor, she's prosecutor in the

72:04
Hillsboro County State Attorney's Office. Yeah. So, she was she was privy to this stuff. Yeah. At least aware that it was happening. And um

72:11
in hold on in 2009 she ran for attorney general. In December 2009 she left his position

72:18
to run for Florida attorney general. She was elected as Florida's attorney general in 2010. Um

72:24
let me just make sure that so the plea deal was 2008 is why I'm getting that a

72:29
little off. That makes sense because Alex Aosta took a lot of heat but then he moved up in the ranks.

72:35
Yeah. Um because Epstein gets popped clearly with all this evidence of

72:41
soliciting sex from like down to like 13year-old girls, like hundreds of

72:46
incidences, uh dozens of victims, lots of evidence, and he gets this like cushy kind of like

72:53
house arresty like one-year like sentence and didn't have to plead guilty

72:59
and become a sex offender on the registry. I I forget the exact details and it was atrocious. And um and Alex

73:06
Aosta at one point gave a quote that was essentially like why did you give him the sweetheart deal? And I I believe

73:11
this quote came in 2019 once Epste actually got arrested and they were ask they were going back at Aosta being like why did you do that? And the quote was I

73:18
was told to leave him alone because he belonged to intelligence as in intelligence agencies. I remember hearing that. Yep. Right. And and so

73:27
the that piece of evidence is deeply significant, but it's it's just in some

73:33
ways it's just significant because it's was so in the public eye and so prominent of a figure and so important

73:39
of a figure saying it, but there's lots of evidence long before that of what was going on, right? And that's why Whitney

73:45
Webb's books are so enlightening because they fill in so many details both of Epstein's early life, the networks that

73:51
he was brought into, and of the people surrounding him in the testimonies, for example, of a man named Ari Ben Manashi,

73:57
who is an ex-MSSAD agent that uh openly alleged in sworn testimony um that

74:04
Epstein worked for Israel and for Israeli intelligence. Um and and and so

74:11
so there's lots of data points that we don't need to get into all the little data points. Probably better to rewind

74:16
and talk a little bit about how Epste got to where he is and who put him there because that's very informative. It was it was Lexner, right? Or

74:22
Well, Wexner was his bankroll. So Epstein started as a teacher that he was not qualified to be a teacher. Hired by

74:28
uh Bill Bar's dad, right? Bill Barr being the guy that finally o was

74:33
overseeing like he was uh what he was the head of not the DOJ, he was uh um

74:42
he wasn't the attorney general, right? Bill Barr. He might have been the attorney general when Epstein committed suicide in

74:48
prison. What year is this? Um 2019. Um oh yeah. Uh and uh his dad hired Epste at the Dalton

74:56
School way back when Epstein was a little guy. um not qualified to be a teacher. There was al allegations that he was showing

75:02
up at, you know, the college parties like being touchy with the girls even back then. Then he got hired from that

75:10
school into a bank that he wasn't qualified to bank at, though he was apparently very intelligent um by either

75:16
Goldstein or Goldsmith. He like there's different uh theories about whether he got the connection through a female

75:22
student's father or through a male student's father into uh into Bear

75:29
Sterns. Um it's actually kind of fuzzy for me now. Um there's a lot of information. Yeah. Right. I'm pretty sure it was Bear

75:35
Sterns. Um and was there banking for a while until this big scandal broke out. And that scandal involved him and the

75:43
CEO who he was kind of buddies with who had brought him in. He wasn't the CEO when he brought him in, but he had risen. I believe he was the CEO when the

75:49
scandal broke out. And Epste departed and kind of took that scandal with him and it kind of cleared everything up, right? And they never really like went

75:54
to the top with it. And that's when he moved into this weird middle part where he was a bounty hunter for billionaires.

76:00
He claimed though he had no resume and no one had ever heard of him doing any trades or making any deals or doing any managing any money. Um except for this

76:07
like weird woman from Spain that alleged that he had like helped her father recover some weird story. Um, so he's

76:14
like at this gray area where he's like managing money for billionaires, but no one knows what he's doing. He's laundering money is what he's doing. And

76:20
he gets and he starts to get hooked up with organized crime figures and he starts to show up around uh arms traffickers, specifically Douglas Lee,

76:27
who I believe was British. Um, but these arms traffickers traffic to and from everyone. And Israel is a big part of

76:33
arms trafficking, as is the Middle East, as is, you know, MI6, as is the CIA. So,

76:38
this just made me think of something. Not to derail you, but uh in the BB files, it talks about the connection

76:44
with BB and the Hollywood executive. What's his name? Um Oh, Arnon Milchin. Arnon Milchin. So, he was he also had

76:49
connections to like arms dealing, right? Didn't he? Yeah. Well, Arnon Milchin helped steal the nuclear weapons program from the

76:55
United States and transfer. Is there a connection there? There could be. It's hard to say. I mean, I like

77:01
probably swam in some of the same circles. My understanding is that Arnold Milchin is older and that he was doing those deal that he was working as a spy

77:08
for Israel in the 70s, I believe, but it probably was in the 80s because it was like the whole James Bond

77:14
era thing. Yeah, I don't actually know um Aron Milchin's backstory too deeply. Um so don't quote me on that.

77:19
Okay. But uh probably a different operation could have swam in the same circles for sure. Um but another so it's Douglas Lee

77:26
is one of the names that Whitney uh links him with a lot but also with a non- Koshogi who is Saudi by birth from

77:33
the Koshogi family um Jamal Kosogi but also was known to be deeply inshed with

77:40
Israeli arms trafficking and Anan Koshogi was famous for having his boat that he had wired up with cameras that

77:46
Trump later bought that he would do arms deals on this boat and ply people with young girls and liquor and drugs and

77:52
film everything that happened on that boat and Epstein was swimming in those arms trafficking circles and probably money laundering circles and it's a lot

77:58
of speculation. We don't really know, right? And at this in that time period he also linked up with Robert Maxwell who by now

78:05
had defected like between two or three different countries from MI6 to working

78:10
for Israel Israeli intelligence and he also got linked up with Ahood Barack who

78:16
for a brief period was the head of Israeli military intelligence but also held all these other highranking positions including prime minister of

78:22
Israel in the '90s. Yep. Um, and so that's when Epstein meets all these people and that's when during the

78:29
'9s, I believe it was, after this period of like what's going on, he gets linked up with Leslie Wexner, who runs El

78:36
Brands, the limited, which owns Victoria's Secret, Abberromian Fitch, Hollister, lots more.

78:43
At some point in the 90s there, um I think around 91 to 94ish, I forget the

78:49
year, uh Leslie Wexner signs over the power of attorney for his entire business, fortune, money

78:56
for everything. Yeah. Entire power of attorney over to Jeffrey Epste. You don't just do that. No. meaning that this one of the richest

79:03
billionaires in the world gives this dude Jeffrey Epstein the power to sell anything that Leslie

79:09
owns to buy anything with Leslie's money to you know literally manage everything Lesie owns without him present without

79:15
his knowledge without him involved at all Jeffrey Epste's signature now stands in for Leslie Wexner's signature

79:21
whenever and wherever he wants and a that's [¬†__¬†] b that gives him

79:27
the power to say I didn't know what epste was up to that gives him plausable And Epste

79:36
apparently Victoria's Secret as his cover and using money from the limited to

79:42
purchase these properties to purchase the jet I think to uh basically build

79:48
the financial base of this network, right? And Leslie Wexner obviously didn't know

79:54
anything about it. He had no idea it was happening. Although in '92 he also installed another pedophile CEO that was

80:00
raping the young boys that were at Abberrombie and Fitch. He installed the CEO of Abberro and Fitch, Mike Jeff, who

80:05
just got off on the insanity plea. Um, so Leslie Wexner just has bad luck in hiring obviously and just happened to

80:11
hire two pedophiles to um, you know, run his two modeling businesses. And Jeffrey

80:17
Epste is now gallivanting around the world posing as a Victoria's Secret modeling scout to take girls from far away places and offer them like their

80:23
big shot, fly them away to the island, and then, you know, rape them with his buddies. And um and

80:31
along the way there's all these ties to Israel, to highlevel Zionists like

80:37
Leslie Wexner for example, like Glenn Dubin. Um but then also like it's not

80:42
like the network is exclusively Zionists and Jewish people. Like there is for example um uh Jean Luke Bernell is a

80:48
French guy, although France is very deep in the deep state. Um but Jean Luke Brenell is a French modeling scout that

80:55
was doing all sorts of horrible stuff and recruiting for Epste as well. and he got mysteriously suicide. He

81:00
mysteriously committed suicide. I think when was that? Um in 2021, I believe it was after

81:05
Epstein went down and it was like, well, let's cover this up. Jeez. I forget exactly what year he got popped

81:11
or I mean popped himself obviously. Um but uh so so there's this is a vast

81:17
network and I don't think that anyone is claiming that it was only Israelis or like

81:23
intelligence agencies for Israel. Yes. Yes. These things operate in these shadows where lots of people know and lots of people are kind

81:29
of getting angles, but it was targeting a bunch of Americans, a bunch of wealthy

81:34
Western people, uh, Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton, top Americans. Oh, yeah. Bill Clinton. Yeah. So, 17

81:40
visits on record to the White House. And they were, uh, first

81:45
um, so Jeffrey Epste was first brought to Bill Clinton's White House by a man named Mark Middleton. And you should

81:50
look up the Wikipedia page for Mark Middleton. Look into the story of Mark Middleton. Find articles about how Mark Middleton died by I [¬†__¬†] you not. The

81:59
reporting is a little fuzzy on how exactly he died because it was so weird. Um, but it was a suicide to be very

82:05
clear. And the suicide involved him tied to a tree with hung from a tree and or tied

82:12
to a tree with an extension cord while shooting himself in the chest with a shotgun twice.

82:17
Yeah, I heard about that one. Um because he needs to not talk about what happened with his boy Jeffrey.

82:23
Yeah. Um but anyways, Jeffrey Epste visits Bill Clinton's White House 17 times, often with unnamed beautiful women on

82:29
his arm. Bill Clinton flies on the jet, yada yada yada. Um and Jeffrey Epste was

82:34
clearly targeting tech billionaires, uh powerful politicians, celebrities, celebrities, you name it. And he was not

82:40
just doing sexual blackmail. This is one thing that Whitney does a great job of exposing that is really important to

82:46
talk about is Jeffrey Epste was also cultivating influence. He was donating to schools like MIT and Harvard and

82:54
others. He was cultivating scientists by hosting conferences so that scientists

82:59
would because scientists need money. They need money for their for their uh investigations, for their experiments, for their like lives. And so he would

83:06
host these big conferences and they would swarm to him like moths to a light in with hopes of funding. And also

83:12
scientists just want to hang out with top scientists. And so when you have like uh like Stephen Hawking and uh oh

83:18
what's Marvin Minsky the real freak um allegedly and all these other ones like

83:23
when they're all at these conferences you want to be at this. All the scientists are going to want to be there. Yeah. Literally on Epste Island. Like he's

83:28
hosting these conferences on Epste Island. And so he's cultivating multiple layers of intelligence assets. One is probably

83:37
blackmailing people with underage sex. Um, one is probably just technological

83:42
favor like cultivating uh interest in the tech industry that later transformed into what sets up a tech blackmail like

83:50
a techbased blackmail network of like you don't need to have a network of pedophil like pedophilia pedophilia

83:58
suppliers and purveyors and protectorates and like trafficking children is hard. a lot easier to just

84:04
get someone to watch some child porn. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Um hard drives and and stuff like that. So, it's like

84:10
the the blackmail networks have shifted largely digital and hacking based and he was working on that as he went down. Um

84:17
but he was also uh sort of matchmaking for very wealthy people. Like for

84:23
example, Glenn Dubin. There's some crazy testimony from uh Joanna Schoberg, Sj O

84:30
Berg G, um who's one of the victims who testified under oath that uh

84:37
I guess I'm conflating two testimonies here. She has some crazy testimony, but the testimony that I'm thinking of are

84:43
from the chef and the chef's husband that worked for Glenn Dubin, who is one

84:48
of the close associates of Epstein. And they said that uh Eva Anderson Dubin,

84:54
his wife, brought a very young girl into the apartment one day and she was super distraught. And when she left the room,

85:00
undefined

85:00
the young girl starts telling them about how she was trapped on this island and they took her passport and she was sexually abused and all this stuff. And

85:06
then the wife comes back in and she shuts up and it's like over and they were super uncomfortable obviously. And

85:12
Eva Anderson Dubin is Jeffrey Epste's former girlfriend of 10 years long. And then he he matches her up with his buddy

85:19
Glenn Dubin right before Glen Dubin gets this great uh gig with JP Morgan. All this stuff, sells his company, makes a

85:25
ton of money. Um Jeffrey Epste also um oh, I'm going to forget her name, the the the blonde one. Uh Johnny Vedmore

85:33
talks a lot about this blonde chick that is like infiltrating the British stuff. Also, Jeffrey Epstein alleged he alleged

85:42
hard to corroborate that he introduced Melania to Trump. What? Yeah. Jeffrey Epste alleged

85:47
when? Really? Yeah. Yeah. He alleged and I know you can't obviously like who knows, but

85:53
Jeffrey Melania was a porn star. Jeffrey Epste alleged that he introduced Melania to Trump and um and that and so that that's this

86:01
matchmaking thing. And those are just a few examples. Um and man, I'm going to remember that blonde one's name.

86:07
That would also explain a little bit, you know, the the people who are like, "Oh, he was on Epste Island, too, because there's pictures of him in

86:12
Epste." I mean, that would explain why he's was with Epstein those times with the pictures and things like that, too.

86:18
Oh, they were buddies back in the day. Yeah. Well, I know that, but I'm saying like if if he was basically matchmaking, that would also explain what you're

86:24
talking about as far as like it's not all about blackmail because of child trafficking or child sex. Like that

86:30
could easily also be a bargaining chip. Influence. Yeah. Just influence in all these ways. Scientific influence,

86:36
educational influence, monetary influence, blackmail influence, all of it. All of all of that is this network.

86:42
And and Jeffrey Epste, let's be clear, was just one employee of a network. He was just one pimp doing one job. And and

86:49
ultimately, I would argue that the women around him, Golain Maxwell, um Sarah

86:55
Ransom, uh and I'm gonna I'm gonna mess up the

87:00
other two girls names that are really big on that. Uh Leslie Croll. Oh. Um

87:05
there's a few others that that uh Galileain was never apparently like one

87:11
of the trafficked girls of Epstein. She was more abused by her father, groomed into this role and then matched to

87:17
Jeffree and she was managing it in a lot of ways it seems. And she was far like absolutely essential and in some ways just as

87:23
guilty as him because she's the one actually out there recruiting these girls, making them feel comfortable, making it this normalized, trying to

87:29
like like psychologically recruit them. And then these other girls that were originally trafficked by him that became

87:34
his like wing girls. Did I get that name right? Sarah Ransom. So you got this is what I this is what I found. These four

87:40
Sarah Kellen that's the name. Yeah. Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Leslie Grath.

87:45
Gizlane Gizlane. Gileain Maxwell. So Sarah Kellen. Funny story. She's changed her name and moved off. So like

87:51
they did not get prosecuted. She was she was for like 10 years. She was like the personal assistant to Gain Maxwell. took

87:58
all the appointments, wrote down all the scheduling, knew everything like phone numbers, books, who's coming and going,

88:03
all of it. Where the girls are, like deeply involved. Um, and was apparently probably a victim early on that then

88:10
kind of turned and helped. Stockholm syndrome, but then she just gets let off. Like no one even like as far as I know, no one

88:16
questioned her. She wasn't she never gave a testimony as far as I know. Um, maybe I'm an idiot, but and then she

88:21
just like changed her name, changed her life and went and married a NASCAR driver and like was living in New York in a penthouse with a second penthouse

88:27
in in uh like Florida until just recently he divorced her and he's like,

88:32
"Fuck this. I'm out." And she is now high and dry and it would be a great time for Cash Patel to go and ask her

88:38
some questions cuz she knows everything. I would assume she knows a lot. Um there there's a lot of other people

88:44
out there from that network. They never even got that simple. Cash said it's not that there's there's so much that they

88:50
have to protect this. I mean, honestly, I wanted to believe I still want to hold on to hope. I I do

88:55
still want to hold on to hope. There's a there is a legitimate argument to be made that I don't put a lot of stock in

89:00
that Jeffrey Epste might be in witness protection. Oh, I I don't doubt that at all. He might be.

89:06
I don't doubt that he's alive for sure. I I don't I definitely don't. Well, here's the thing. If if he's in

89:12
witness protection, I don't think he's dead. But that that goes awfully close to Q. Like that is

89:15
undefined

89:18
awfully close to Q. In what way? So I I think you're thinking of it as in

89:23
he's in witness protection so that to protect him like because he's their buddy to protect. That's what I'm thinking. I don't think

89:30
Yeah. You wouldn't employ the official I I don't think and obviously I'm way above

89:35
my pay grade here. I am not an a federal employee. I have no experience with witness protection or federal programs, law enforcement, any of it. Yeah.

89:41
I'm just speculating. But I don't speculate that you would use the witness protection official program to protect

89:47
someone that is like a asset of the global cabal of traffickers because that

89:52
is just not the route you would take. You would just disappear him into the global cabal of traffickers, right? You would just name change in plastic

89:58
surgery him and and disappear him into a foreign country outside of the US government's system. Witness protection

90:04
though it is effective at hiding people, it is used to like and it is used to

90:10
build cases when you have a very high-profile individual that has dirt that needs to be protected from people that will kill them. Like that's what

90:17
you would use witness protection for. And if he was in witness protection, I

90:22
could understand the argument, though I give less and less stock to it every day. I could understand the argument

90:28
that this is the kind of case that you need to take years to build and it's against the most high-profile people in

90:33
the world that have incredible amounts of power that you would need testimony from him. You would need to go after people one by one. You would need like

90:39
and that is kind of Q. Um and and it um the way that Cash and Bonino both just

90:46
flipped on a dime as soon as they got in there, that was that is weird to me. And

90:52
and also the fact that they just so was it Cash that just came out and said, "Uh, we have footage. We know that he

90:59
for sure killed himself." Like we have G. Yes. My This is what's weird to me. And I I made a video about this. I I

91:05
said, you know, isn't it interesting that that comes out right as AI is getting so good? Bingo.

91:11
Because how easy would it be to doctor that video? Oh, civilian AI, you could fool someone today, especially boomers.

91:17
Let alone good AI. Yeah, exactly. Let alone the secret AI. Yeah. So, I don't know. I struggle with

91:22
that one, man. I really do because it's like they flipped so fast from what they were talking about before. And the

91:28
problem is I know a lot of I I don't know Cash or or Bonino, but I know a lot of the other Conc influencers that took

91:35
the same route they did where it was like be very outspoken, be very proTrump, you know, skirt like just tow

91:41
the line, tow the line, tow the line, then eventually get a position and a lot of money. And it's hard for me to see it any other way because I know some of

91:47
those people and their intentions and it's very much just to get the position and the power and the money.

91:53
It could be. But like I I hate to say it, but I do think that Cash and and Bonino's resumes were two resumes,

92:01
distinct resumes that both spoke to integrity to me in a sense that like Cash went against

92:06
everything. I felt the same way. Yeah, dude. I I was stoked. Cash was the voice of like of this is

92:12
this narrative is [¬†__¬†] This is deep state. I cannot tell you how many times I posted stuff about Cash being being

92:17
like, dude, I it was all about him. I It was one that was one of the reasons why I was so stoked about the administration

92:23
and Bonino always came across as a straight shooter. Everyone that I know in the industry that knows Bonino says

92:28
he's a total straight shooter and so it's very weird like given Bonino is a

92:33
Zionist. Um and he he has been for a long time and in a kind of weird I have a really hard taking really a

92:40
really hard time taking anybody seriously. That's Yeah, it's true. It's But that being said, it's weird how hard they turned,

92:48
how quickly. And so just it gives me time to question and pause. And this is where like everyone on the internet will like take my words out of context and

92:54
say, "I believe this or I believe this or I believe this like I'm a Q or I'm a this or I'm a that." I'm not saying I'm any of that. I'm not saying I believe in

93:00
any of that. I'm just saying that if you want to be an intelligent, rational person, you should just think about ideas and ask questions and and be open

93:07
to engaging with questions and like and it's so weird. I know you have to deal with it way more than me or anybody else, but like it's so weird that that's

93:13
how that you have to clarify that every single time because it's like all all you're doing is questioning the

93:20
narrative and asking questions about each and every possible scenario. That's what normal rational people do.

93:25
But the thing is that the internet skews towards simplicity. It skews towards fighting. Skews towards, you know, click

93:31
and rage bait. And a lot of people are like generally like low information. uh

93:38
like kind of like more I don't want to say like small-minded but like just lower information thinkers that are busy

93:44
with their lives and don't have the time to have the information and knowledge and and and so it's like you know you know

93:50
the people that are thinking get it and they know what's going on here and it's I'm just saying that there's a lot of options that we do not know and it's

93:56
important to think about all the options and I love the Q people. I think they're [¬†__¬†] hilarious and amazing and I and

94:01
I don't mean hilarious like I'm laughing at them. I mean, like I I think it's awesome and I love talking to them and I don't necessarily agree with their

94:07
takes, but I love that they're out here speculating. Yeah. Um I'm not of the mind that we should just be like hopeful

94:12
that like trust it and like they've got it. It's our job to always be questioning, always be holding the powerful to account. And if if there is

94:18
a let's like let's play it out. Suppose Q is right. Suppose there's a Q thing going on and there's all these like good

94:26
guys that are in on it and they're like prosecuting the bad guys secretly behind the scenes and Trump is like like secretly behind this plot in some way.

94:33
That's great. Cool. Then it's up to us to do our part and to

94:40
keep keep criticizing, keep reporting, keep picking up breadcrumbs and keep being critical of the power. And we if

94:46
if they're that if they're on that train and Q is real and they're like have Hillary Clinton in like already like for

94:52
dead for rights or she's been replaced or whatever. If any of that's true then like

94:57
it doesn't matter if I criticize Trump. It's all good, dude. It's all good. They've got it. And like if I criticize Trump during that process, then I'll

95:03
just be proven wrong when it all comes out. And that's fine. But if if there's any chance that that

95:09
is not true, we damn well better be scrutinizing. We better be watching. We better be criticizing. Yeah. Exactly. And I I said, you know,

95:15
you everybody's heard me say this, so for anybody that's listened to this a million times, beaten a dead horse, but

95:20
it's the truth. It's like for me, I look at that as it's very easy. It's there's

95:25
two things. You're either a patriot or you are a loyalist. And when you are continuing to just give

95:30
undefined

95:32
somebody a pass, when they are making decisions that go completely against not who you voted for, but what you

95:39
voted for. when they go against your values and your principles and the things that truly make our country great

95:44
and America first and all these different things. When you are just allowing that to happen and making excuses and and defending it, you're not

95:52
being patriotic. You're being a loyalist. You're being a sheep. You're being a sheep and you're just saying, "I'm going to trust this guy no

95:57
matter what, even if he freaking runs me down the the, you know, the AI hole." It's like right off the cliff.

96:03
You have to be willing to criticize your officials and hold them accountable to make the decisions based on the values

96:08
and the principles that you vote for. That's what we vote for. That's what being a patriot's all about. And it's not about like when I criticize Trump,

96:15
it's not because I don't like Trump. It's not because I still don't think that he's the best option. Like I still

96:20
think I'm still very much agreed. I am still very glad that he's in power and not Kamla, right? And and like

96:28
but we all know what was behind Kamla. Yeah, we all know what was coming there. But like the reality is it doesn't mean that

96:33
you let off the gas and that you just get comfortable. And it's really interesting because me being in the

96:40
space that I have been for the last 5 years and like being very involved in like the patriotic space and just like

96:46
all about patriotism and everything, right? It's it's really interesting if you guys are are listening to this right now. Like I I know that you're going to

96:53
resonate with this even if you're one of the people that have done this. the those people that were so gung-ho about

96:59
patriotism, they were so adamant about standing up for what's right and freedom and patriotic this and patriotic that.

97:05
It's like, ever since Trump got elected, guess what's happened? You've let off

97:10
the gas. And I'm talking to you right now. If you're one of those people, I'm talking directly to you. You've let off

97:16
the gas and you've gotten comfortable because now you don't have anything to lose in your mind. in in your mind

97:24
everything that you fought for you got back because again you've created this hope that this guy is going to give you

97:30
everything that you fought for for years. But the reality is we are the ones that give that to ourselves and we

97:36
are the ones that fight for it. And like stopping that fight just because you

97:42
think that you're safe again. That's not what it's about. That's not how it goes. And like that's what I see happening. I I see

97:49
people getting comfortable again. I mean, look around, right? What have we gotten? Yeah. Right. We haven't gotten the documents

97:55
we said we were going to get. We got a couple of JFK documents that were pretty hazy, but like Epste still waiting on

98:00
that desk. Um, we haven't gotten the mass deportations that we were promised. No, we haven't gotten

98:06
But we're being told that we did. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're being The White House Instagram page is does a great job of making people feel like we

98:12
got a lot of great things. Like we almost got a new war. Thank goodness we didn't. I will give him credit for that. Um, although Yeah. like

98:18
that is a far from settled settled deal. The ceasefire last we uh we've gotten speech laws plenty of

98:25
speech laws uh infringing on the first amendment um which are highly concerning. We've gotten Peter Teal

98:31
directly straight mainlined into the American government. Um, and digital

98:37
mass surveillance well on its way and AI overlords like Larry Ellison standing next to Trump on like day five talking

98:43
about like uh mRNA vaccines that are modifiable to every person. Like so many

98:49
and and then we obviously get the big beautiful bill which is this like giant mega monstrosity that I have not dug all

98:54
into and I'm not well involved but it's wild. three trillion more in debt in the next uh over the next 10 years, I think

98:59
is what I said. So, it's just like like look around and ask yourself, is this the Trump that

99:00
undefined

99:05
that stood on stage and and shhat all over Jeb Bush, I don't want your money. I don't need your money and I'm not

99:12
going to take your money. Like, that guy is not the guy that we currently have in. At least it doesn't look like it. Sure doesn't look like it. And I don't

99:18
know why that is. I don't know if it's because he's been corrupted. I don't know if it's because he knows things. I don't know if it's because that's just

99:23
how humans work or what. Blackmail. I don't know. I'm just saying like yeah, you know,

99:28
well, and so I kind of cut you off before when you were talking about the Epstein connection. So you you covered like this is why it's easy to believe

99:35
that he is not only that he was not only blackmailing and that he was running in the blackmail network and that that but

99:40
you what you didn't connect was okay. So, why is it that people believe that Israel specifically is so tied into that

99:48
blackmail operation and that that might be what's pulling the strings and and continuing this quite frankly military

99:54
conquest across the Middle East that we just keep funding? Well, at the start of this piece, it's always important to

99:59
couch the fact that I'm not talking about all Jews. Um, and obviously neither am I. And um, and that Jewish organized crime

100:07
has a long and rich history in America. and and you are uh uninformed if you

100:13
think that is not true. The mob, the word mob classically refers to the Jewish mob

100:19
because the mafia was Italian and there was also an Irish mafia. The mob was Jewish. They worked together a lot, but

100:25
like organized crime is always grouped up racially because you need to trust the people that you're committing crimes with all across the country and world

100:31
because that's why we have the Yakuza and the Brata and the mafia and the mob and you know what nationality I'm

100:36
talking about every time I say those things. the Crips, the Bloods, you know. Yep. Um, and so gangs and organized crime

100:43
forms along racial and religious identities, whatever, whatever's the strongest tie that binds because you

100:48
need secrecy to be upheld for the highest possible reasons. And the Jewish mob in America has a long and storied

100:55
history. And they were deeply inshed in supplying the weapons that founded Israel, supplying money that founded

101:01
Israel. They were deeply inshed in the founding of Israel. Um, and so that that's just to say that there is such a

101:07
thing as racial organized crime. And when you talk about racial organized crime, obviously not all Italians are in the mafia, right? Duh. And if you talk

101:14
about the mafia, you're not talking about all Italians. Okay. Yeah. But when you look at a criminal organization and every single person in

101:21
that criminal organization seems to be Italian and then they're talking to the ex head of Sicily,

101:26
can you call it Italian organized crime? like and the dude that's funding the organization is also one of the world's

101:32
largest funders of Sicily. You start to think, huh, maybe this has something to do with Sicily, right? So Jeffrey

101:38
Epstein was bankrolled by Lesie Waxner, one of the most prominent Zionist philanthropists in the world, like bar

101:46
almost none. Um he was apparently handled by Ahood Barack who visited him

101:52
uh like uh 30 times that we know of across a span of five years. And at a

101:58
certain point it was actually on a regular monthly schedule that he visited him once a month in his apartment sneaking in and out not like the other

102:05
guys that were like coming and hanging out for days apparently. And like no Aud Barack was like wrapping his face up,

102:10
sneaking in, sneaking out kind of things. And we have photos of that. Um, and obviously he denies all involvement in this, but he was the ex- head of

102:17
Israeli military intelligence. He is one of he is one of the most decorated military officers in the Israeli Defense

102:23
Forces, in the Israeli military in general, in all of Israeli history. He was the prime minister of Israel for a

102:28
while and he very much looks like Epste's handler in terms of how close to this operation he was. Um, Epste was

102:35
also recruited and trained apparently by uh, Robert Maxwell who we know was Israeli intelligence at that point. And

102:42
then his daughter who was grooming Robert was Gen's father. Exactly. His daughter then helped um and

102:47
actually uh Julian Dory when I went on his podcast he made a really interesting connection that I did not put together

102:53
before that um Robert Maxwell disappeared mysteriously died. He uh fell overboard

103:00
from his yacht in what might have been an accident, might have been an assassination, might who knows? It was

103:05
in the 90s. Um I think 91 I forget. Um I don't I yeah don't quote 911 but Robert

103:12
Maxwell dies and right around that same time period Jeffrey Epste comes into a whole bunch of money and this network

103:18
gets set up right and it it really is weird timing and the and Julian was

103:23
specifically pointing to the amount of money that Robert Maxwell laundered from the pension funds um in in his business

103:30
that was like the crime that was the big scandal that was blowing up and like he mentioned a certain piece of reporting

103:35
that I'm forgetting what it was that like Jeffrey Epstein suddenly like wound up with this this exact same sum of

103:41
money through this other thing 1991 you're right November 1991 mysteriously disappeared from his

103:46
interesting connections and and so that that's just a few of the connections then we have ex-Israeli intelligence assets like Ari Ben Manashi directly

103:53
claiming that Epste worked for Israel but then there's also just like the anti-semitic conspiracy theory quote

103:58
unquote that when you look at the people that that promoted Jeffrey Epste through the ranks that surrounded him all the

104:03
way from like the Goldbergs and Goldsteines that and I'm not making a joke there literally there two Goldstein

104:09
and one Goldberg I believe in the banking era of Epstein early on. I might be flipping the Goldberg and the Goldsteeen there, but um through those

104:16
bankers and then into um Leslie Wexner into the arms traffickers he was working

104:21
with into the people around him in this network that were like the Leslie Wexers, the Glen Dubans. Uh a lot of

104:28
those people that seem to be on his team were and not to mention the Louders, the Mega Group. There's there's a whole

104:35
network through um Lesie Wexner into the mega group which very much looks like an Israeli like philanthropic front company

104:43
so to speak. It was actually an intelligence asset. Um and Israel is well known for setting up private industry front companies like

104:51
Paragon which is a whole other thing. Um many of them exporting their technological assets these days out of

104:57
unit 8200 into the private sector so they can work with all the governments and then like oopsies we spied on you.

105:02
Um it's like well known like when you like Israel is known as like one of the

105:09
highest level most sophisticated intelligence networks in the worldly. Absolutely. And the CIA is very well

105:15
aware that Israel is one of our greatest intelligence threats and they have they have infiltrated, spied on, stolen from

105:21
us more times than just about any other nation except for maybe China. Um, and obviously like I'm not an expert on like

105:28
deep intelligence, but uh it's not hard to look this stuff up and the long history from like the Promise software

105:34
scandal all the way through the Jonathan Pard affair, the new mech affair where they stole their nuclear weapons program from us that they still pretend like

105:40
they don't have. Um, straight up to Jeffrey Epstein. And so it's like his network was a whole bunch of Jewish

105:47
Zionist uh power players that had all sorts of direct ties to Israel. And like

105:54
he probably wasn't working for the mainstream US government because all of his targets were Americans, including

105:59
our own president. So like maybe the US government, but like come on. Yeah. There might be some assets in the CIA

106:05
that were in there that were helping that were working, but like you know Yeah. But then like nowadays you get you

106:12
get dumb asses on the internet trying to claim that like maybe Epste worked for Qar, like maybe Epste worked for Saudi

106:18
Arabia. Like bro, have you seen ArabIsraeli relations? Have you seen Arab Jewish relations? Like you think

106:24
that the network of all the Jewish sex trafficking and money laundering was working on behalf of an Arab nation

106:31
instead of the one Jewish state in the Middle East? Like come on. And um Dan

106:36
Bonino, I think it was had a clip from before he went in where he was talking about his source at Fox News that told

106:43
him behind the scenes that like yeah, Jeffrey Epste was working for someone in the Middle East. We don't know who. That

106:49
one of that clip along with a couple others is what made me think Bonino's freaking bot. Like

106:55
I'm very confused by that. When I saw that, I was like, "Okay, you know, like you have to know."

107:01
And then and then it was right after that that that Matt Gates clip came out. Yeah. Where Gates was, was it I can't remember

107:07
if heavily implying Israel. Heavily, but he wouldn't say it. He still wouldn't say it, but he was heavily implying it.

107:13
Yeah. the amount of power they have is so apparent for anyone with eyes and anyone with ears that it's like you have

107:19
to be willfully blind, uh, religiously indoctrinated or um like like subhuman

107:28
IQ to not notice what's going on here. Um, so it's like we don't know for sure

107:34
that he was working for Israel, but like to imagine that he was not working with Israel is a pretty far stretch. I feel

107:40
like it's one of those things where it's it's one of those situations where there's so many coincidences that it's

107:46
like at what point are there too many coinc to to Q's point, right? Because this is what Q said for the longest

107:51
time. At what point are there too many coincidences to be a coincidence? And it's mathematically impossible. Yeah. Exactly. And so that that's where

107:59
I see that. I'm I'm curious of something. Um you know, you've had a lot of conversations with people when it

108:05
comes to Zionism, when it comes to what you said. You said people are either willfully ignorant, religiously

108:12
indoctrinated, or I was being flippant when I said subhuman IQ. But but no, but but really kind of dumb.

108:19
Yeah. But so let's just go with this the middle one though because I'm curious. I think that the majority of people are probably more religiously indoct

108:25
indoctrinated and that's why it's so easy to rile everybody up because we all know that,

108:30
you know, there's really two things that get people so incredibly riled up when it comes to conflicts and it's race and

108:37
religion. Yep. It's the exact reason why BLM happened. It's the exact reason why what's happening right now. Because I per personally I believe that what's

108:44
happened in this country as far as Israel versus Palestine is honestly the same damn thing that happened in this

108:49
country in 2020 versus white and black. White and black was the testing ground. It was like how can we get these people

108:55
to be absolutely infuriated with each other to the point where they actually like I lost a 10-year friend because

109:00
undefined

109:01
just because of who I supported and what I didn't support, all of a sudden he decided I was a racist after 10 years. He dude, I lost

109:08
all my friends. Do you know how many times he came to my house and like I called his mom my mom and his my mom was his mom and like it

109:15
was wild. He was my best man. Like crazy. But anyway, it got to the point where, you

109:22
know, that's the kind of polarization that they created and I think it was a testing ground for now what you're seeing is something that is far advanced

109:29
because now you have the United States that is completely divided in a conflict that has gone on for hundreds of years.

109:37
really well really decades the the main conflict but yet people are so so

109:44
entrenched in their own camp. So my question for you is this. When you have

109:50
that conversation, if you're ever able to about the about Zionism and trying to

109:56
help people see that they've been religiously indoctrinated when it comes to that ideology as far as the current

110:01
conflict, right? What how do you address it? Um, I don't

110:06
often actually have it in person because um, people don't engage that conversation with me in public unless

110:13
they agree with me to a certain extent or open to hearing it. Okay. Um, how would you address it? But the way that I so kind of the way I

110:20
I address any conflict is I I never try to convince other people of my

110:25
perspective until I listen to them. Um, and this is why I don't do a lot of debates because I actually in almost all

110:32
cases would would rather sit down and ask them lots of questions about what they believe. Um, because a you're never going to

110:40
convince someone by fighting with them about things. You're only going to make them retreat into their own defensive position and b

110:47
you might not understand their perspective completely and they might not understand yours. and and um people

110:53
don't feel comfortable uh hearing you until they feel heard as well. And so

110:59
you want to make sure you're hearing them correctly in their stance and understand their stance genuinely, but you also want to make sure that they

111:05
hear their own stance genuinely and and are and know that you're there for that and that you're there for a real conversation because it's so easy for it

111:11
to feel like it's going to devolve right away, right? Um, and so to me that starts looking like a lot of questions of like like why do you believe that

111:18
Israel has the right to that land and and like genuinely curious and if it's religious asking about that and like

111:25
what like what passages why do you believe that like and and so for and and obviously these questions can go very

111:31
far down and it's really easy to flip into at a certain point like gotcha that's wrong and I would argue that in

111:39
those instances to me like the obvious one is like the Ted Cruz and Tucker Carlson interview that just came out

111:45
where Ted Cruz is like in Gen and Tucker Carlson's like it's in Genesis which was hilarious like I don't actually know

111:50
where the passage is talking to that night. Um but that passage does not say Israel.

111:56
That passage says those um like what is it? Uh

112:01
those who bless shall be blessed and those who do not shall not. Whatever it is, right? It's not it doesn't say Israel. And actually like that Old

112:07
Testament passage, if I'm not mistaken, was written before Jacob's name was even changed to Israel.

112:12
Yeah. But I am no biblical scholar. I would lovely I would love to break that down. Genesis.

112:18
Genesis. And I don't I don't actually know um because I am no biblical scholar. But neither am in that instance because I'm not a

112:24
biblical scholar. I would start asking them like like I heard this and I don't want to be

112:29
misled and I'm I don't know a lot about the Bible. So, what's your take on this information on this other argument that that I've heard from other people? And

112:36
that can help to um create distance and make it not as personal so they don't feel like you're attacking them, but

112:41
you're just genuinely asking like I'm curious how you would respond because I want to hear your response, right? And then if and then depending on their

112:48
response be like, "Okay, I understand that like or I don't understand that. What like you know, try to really understand someone because a that will

112:55
often get them to a point of being like, you know, I thought you were a more judgmental person." and then suddenly

113:00
you you can be human with them and and B sometimes you actually get to a point where they're like, "Oh, I don't actually have any idea what I'm talking

113:06
about." Um, and either either outcome is fine. It's just like or if you're in a debate situation, like the best way to

113:11
catch someone in their own [¬†__¬†] is to just ask them lots of questions. Yeah. Um because like the the ultimate thing

113:18
about the Zionist stance is that it is all built on double speak and lies. And

113:23
every single talking point like Israel has a right to defend itself. Does Iran have a right to defend itself? Right?

113:30
Like, okay. Um, Hamas are all terrorists, right? Okay.

113:35
Like, what about Israeli terrorism? What about Jewish terrorism? Right. Like, from the river to the sea is a genocidal

113:43
slogan. Yeah. Like, it can be for sure. Um, and some of those some of those

113:48
people that chant it are certainly wishing death to all Jews flatly rejecting the exist

113:54
like what about Ben Gir who subscribes to the party that said we should eliminate all Palestinians like like

113:59
right is is this not equal and like what about the rapes? What about the prisoners? What about the like all of that is a a crazy double speak and the

114:06
the most obvious glaring one is Iran's nuclear program. Yeah. Right. Iran does not have a nuke and we

114:11
know they don't have a nuke and we're we're arguing about whether they intend to make one and are going to and can and even if they did we all pretty much

114:17
agree that they couldn't deliver it to the US. That's for damn sure. Um but

114:20
undefined

114:23
Israel has a secret nuclear program that they are allegedly using to blackmail the whole world. Read um read the Samson

114:30
option. The Samson option. And um beyond that they stole it from the from Go ahead and tell them what's the Samson option because I think a lot of people

114:36
don't know what that is. What's the Samson option? Allegedly, the Samson option, um, which Israel flatly denies,

114:43
is the Israeli nuclear deterrence policy, which is basically a threat that

114:48
if all y'all allies, if all of y'all don't help us defend ourselves and we face an existential threat, we will

114:55
train, we will target all of everyone with our nukes and we'll just blow it [¬†__¬†] everyone up because we're not

115:00
going to Everybody's going out. Exactly. that is apparently the Samson option and I believe that Seymour Hirs

115:06
was the one that um really kind of broke that open the first time and um and he wrote a whole book called the Samson

115:12
option but other people have also reported on it to various degrees and recently there were like leaked screenshots that Iran apparently like

115:18
hacked Israel and got trust them that's the hard thing too with is with

115:24
with Israel and Iran like the Iranian stuff because I'll be honest there's some stuff that has come out in the last

115:29
few weeks that I'm like yeah that's definitely Iranian propaganda But then there's other stuff I'm like that's not like

115:35
well that's the thing is that so for example I like everything I've just said like a bunch of the Zionist shills will

115:40
say all of that's just Iranian propaganda that you're reviewing right um actually it's just logical thinking

115:46
that any freethinking American would come to like why are my tax dollars funding a foreign war why is Nikki Haley

115:52
signing bombs that are going to drop on children in a foreign nation why do we have Randy Fine saying fill the streets

115:59
with Palestinian blood on Twitter But then

116:00
undefined

116:05
right why why I'm an American

116:12
why is why is nobody questioning the fact that it has been proven without a shadow of a doubt that BB Netanyahu

116:17
literally funded Qatar no he funded Hamas or Hamasar Hamas using Qatar

116:23
propped them up because they were a destabilizing force in the region and he admitted it on on on camera in an

116:29
interview. Why is that Iranian propaganda? Why is that not being asked talked about? Why is it also

116:34
Apparently BB is spouting Iranian propaganda? Yeah, apparently. Why is it also not being talked about the fact that the

116:39
majority of Israel wants this guy in prison? Yeah. And they are not happy with him

116:45
and the nation of Israel does not want to be involved in this. They literally have interviews of victims from October

116:51
7th saying it's BB's fault. Y and we don't even invite him to come to our

116:57
town because of what he has done to us. And like they recognize the Palestinians

117:02
as brothers and sisters while BB recognizes them as roaches. And it's like why is no one asking these

117:08
questions? And and by the way, this is the other thing that drives me insane. Why is it that because I ask those

117:14
questions that all of a sudden now I'm just a terrorist sympathizer? Why is it that immediately I'm seen as somebody

117:21
who only cares about one side? It's not about caring about one side. As a matter of fact, if you want my true opinion, I

117:27
don't want to be in there at all. I don't want to be involved in the conflict in any way, shape, or form. There's I I this is my flag, right? Like

117:34
I don't I don't care. I I do care about the people, but the fact is, in my opinion, there is only one group of

117:42
innocent people in this conflict, and it is the civilians caught in the crossfire. Yep. Both governments, both groups of

117:48
extremists and radicals are just as evil. They're just as messed up. They've been involved in this conflict for way

117:54
too long. There is honestly no solution in my opinion. And trying to pretend like there is and then getting involved

118:00
undefined

118:01
in it as if we have the ability to to create that solution and even more so

118:06
being the ones that are supporting such an evil act of decimating this entire

118:11
population is just it's wild to me. And like any normal freethinking person who

118:17
appreciates freedom over everything would get to that conclusion. And that's that's always been my argument with

118:24
Zionism ever since I like really started d diving into it. It's not that I believe all Jews that that believe

118:31
inherently that they deserve somewhere to live and exist are bad. I actually I I everybody should believe that. That's

118:37
100% the truth and there's nothing wrong with that. That's actually they you should believe that. It's the idea that

118:45
because your religious text and your relig and your your God said in your

118:53
mind like according to your text that you deserve someone else's home. Even

118:58
though the people who live there already don't believe in your god. They don't believe in your religious text. They

119:04
don't even understand your religion. They just have to believe that and they have to get out. And it's like in the

119:11
past nations were conquered and that's just how things were, right? Like that's how the world worked. You you conquered

119:17
a nation and now it's yours. That's what happened in the past. But when you fast

119:22
forward hundreds of years later, that's no longer the way we operate. We go to war over things like that.

119:28
And yet this is the one situation where one group of people said, "Hey, that's

119:33
our land because our God and our scripture says so. Oh, and by the way, these other superpowers, they're gonna come in and help us take it from you

119:40
after you take the land for them. Y and then you're not allowed to say anything about it because sorry, that's

119:47
just the what that's what God said. He's not your God. He's ours. That to me is the clearest definition of a violation

119:54
of somebody's free agency than anything else I can come up with. And that's why

119:59
it's like at if you are somebody who appreciate appreciates freedom, if you're somebody who is constantly

120:06
touting freedom and patriotism and all the things that make America so great,

120:11
there is absolutely zero reason why you should be advocating for somebody else taking away someone else's free agency

120:17
based on a religious standpoint. I mean, it's you can't be you can at this point you can no longer be pro- Israel and

120:23
pro- freedom simply for the reason that I'm allowed to criticize the American

120:28
government and it is not illegal. That's called the first amendment. But now criticizing Israel

120:34
is classified as a crime. Yeah. Because of Well, it's not official yet, but they are working damn hard to bring

120:40
those regulations in and make them law. And already if you criticize Israel on

120:46
college campuses, they can have their their funding pulled. And so it is already seeping in that we are

120:51
protecting any criticism of the nation, the government of Israel as though it

120:56
was anti-semitism against all Jewish people is insanity. And that is like if you're willing to sacrifice your first

121:02
amendment rights in order to protect a foreign nation and their petty little feelings, you're not pro- freedom. No.

121:08
And this is an argument that the Zionists made. Well, the the non-Zionist Jews made all the way back in the

121:14
beginning of the 20th century when the Zionist question was coming up in the Jewish communities. Not all Jewish

121:19
people were for Israel, for the Zionist project. And the Zionists that argued for the project, like they had a lot of

121:26
deliberations and there was a whole bunch of scheming and a whole bunch of, you know, conferences that were held and Herzel, you know, famously is like

121:33
the the helm of that ship. But there was a bunch of Jews that were speaking up saying this is not a good idea. It will

121:39
like yes we are wanderers like and I my understanding is that some were making the religious argument that God did not

121:45
tell us to stop and stop one like God did not give us land right now that's not how the scripture reads and my understanding is that some other ones

121:51
were just making the argument that it's just a bad idea like intellectually speaking and I think we've watched that argument

121:57
play out in the most obvious way because now the unfortunate truth for Jewish

122:03
people for all of us is that now that we have this singular government that was founded by the mob, the Rothschilds, and

122:09
a whole bunch of Israeli and Jewish terrorists. They weren't Israeli yet. Agon, Lehi, look them up.

122:15
Um, yep. when that's the nation that was founded by those people and that nation is now the only hope for the Jewish

122:21
religion and it represents all Judaism around the world and every Jew has to swear allegiance to it or else you're a

122:26
self-hating Jew and suddenly you have embroiled the your entire religion in this government project in this farway

122:33
land that's based on ethnic cleansing and like taking land from other people that like originally welcomed you in.

122:39
That is such a shitty place to to put everyone in. And to have it be based on this infinite war against this this like

122:46
like Osama bin Laden directly told us that he did 911 apparently because of

122:52
our support of Israel. Like this everything is so tied together over there because of this Zionist project

122:58
and Jews are so tied into it unfairly because now they are linked to it

123:03
whether they want to be or not. And even if if you speak out against it, then you're ostracized by your own community. And if you go along with it, then you're

123:10
like complicit in genocide. And then the rest of us are looking at you. And then we're all one because now unfortunately,

123:16
here's the really delicate part, the anti-semitic conspiracy theory.

123:22
There is a lot of anti-semitism. Well, yeah, there's a lot of genuine anti-semitism. But here's the here's the

123:27
really critical delicate part is we would never hire a Chinese national

123:32
in our government, right? You wouldn't do it. N you would never do it. You'd be aing

123:38
idiot. You would never hire an Iranian national. You wouldn't even hire like you would even have some questions if

123:43
you hired like someone from one of our allied nations that was, you know, tied into intelligence. Yeah.

123:48
Yeah. You wouldn't do And we have tons of history of Israel stealing military secrets, stealing technology, infiltrating us, spying on us, all this

123:54
stuff. And and so now every Jewish person, we like look around Twitter, you

124:02
can clearly see how many Jewish people are are have their allegiance to Israel before America or at least before like

124:09
truly America first that we'll flip on a dime for Israel over America. And take Jonathan Pard as just one example in the

124:16
real world of like a highle government official that betrayed our nation on behalf of Israel because of his Jewish

124:22
heritage. And so it's like that sucks for Jewish people. That's not their fault, right? But it's just true that when you

124:31
make this one other nation that is heavily involved in espionage and spying and and intelligence and you make them

124:38
representative of the religion and you tell all Jews from birth that they need to support Israel with their lives and

124:43
all this suddenly you've just made all Jews potential co-conspirators and like

124:49
to no fault of their own like Jews have been ostracized and wandered the world and like are very their own niche their

124:54
own group and so they are in grouping for reasons that are understandable. But all of those things are the elements of

125:00
like like if you're going to work together and you're all going to stand with Israel like above all else, then

125:07
it's like how are you going to call people anti-semitic conspiracy theorists when we're watching Jews all group up to back Israel? And obviously it's not all

125:14
Jews. It's just that's this impossible position that you put Jewish people in that like like I have to remind myself

125:21
every single day that I log into Twitter that it's not all Jews because on Twitter there's Jews everywhere just

125:27
spouting insanity in support of Israel. Like literally there's this one dude that keeps on posting um is people uh I

125:35
I assume they're Israeli Jews that are posting in Hebrew that are like literally openly posting now is a

125:41
perfect time to bomb America to get them back into war with Iraq. I saw that. Yeah, that's you don't think that's propaganda. You don't think

125:47
that's like bots? Cuz that was my first thought when I saw that. It could be. But I I I based upon the

125:53
videos that we have seen of how certain Israelis think about the world from their own mouths, from their own actions

125:58
against Palestinians, their own actions against Americans, like their own action. Like I have no doubt that there

126:05
are Israelis that think that way. You know what's interesting? Did you see um I really I appreciate that

126:10
perspective because I think it's really important. Did you see uh oh, what's his name? What's the dude's name that took

126:15
out Bin Laden? Um oh, I don't remember his name. Robert Robert O'Neal. Robert O'Neal

126:20
posted the other day. I'm actually gonna pull it up because I got to read it. I don't want to butcher it. But what was really funny is that he

126:27
posted this cuz I was like, "Wait a second." Uh who wants to tell him? Like you're the guy that took out, you

126:34
know, Bin Laden. Uh Robert O'Neal.

126:41
Oh, shoot. That's And that's the tragedy, too, is the last Iraq war. It's like, how'd that go? We sent a whole

126:46
bunch of Marines over there to guard poppy fields for like the opium opioid epidemic, like to enact regime change so

126:53
we could enrich the military-industrial complex. Yeah. Like, so here's what he said. Let me just pull it up.

127:00
Oh, no. He deleted it. Bro, are you kidding me right now? Spicy.

127:06
He deleted it. I swear I saved it. But uh anyway, we'll have to look it up.

127:13
Maybe we can find it and put it up, but unless he did delete it, but it said something like, "Am I the only one that's starting to notice uh all the

127:20
ties to Israel with all these conflicts?" And some something along those lines. And we and I was like, "That's the kind of tweet that you might

127:27
delete." I was like, "Uh, who wants to tell him?" Well, that's the thing that everyone is unfortunately starting to notice. And um

127:35
and it is I'm firmly believe that it is important that we always remember it's not all Jewish people.

127:41
It is it's important. Yes. Because um a because everyone deserves a fair chance as an individual. Everyone

127:46
deserves that liberty. But also like it it's just so essential that you don't

127:52
become the thing that you condemn. And I think that that's the real tragedy of Israel is that they have become the

127:58
thing that they allegedly, you know, are a response to which is the Holocaust. Although that is propaganda because

128:00
undefined

128:04
Israel was a project long before the Holocaust and they actually the Lehi group was trying to partner with the

128:10
Nazis in order to bring more Jews over here. Whole other story. But um but like

128:15
Israel's behavior towards the Palestinians right now, it's obviously incomparable because like the Holocaust

128:22
was horrendous. Even if you're one of the ones that believe that like it was

128:27
exaggerated or there was like if if you're one of the ones that wants to like dig into the specifics of the Holocaust, cool. It's still horrible.

128:34
It's still a horrible thing no matter which way you shake. And we have more than enough evidence that that some really horrible [¬†__¬†]

128:39
happened during the Holocaust, regardless of your take on what exactly it was. Yep. But what's happening right now in Gaza

128:46
is a captive population that cannot leave that are being starved to death. They're being the water being

128:51
controlled. They're being sniped. They are sniping children while they scramble for food. They just they just launched

128:57
they just put out a report I posted about it. The Herz whatever came out over 400 civilians have been gunned down

129:03
at at food sites. Not only that, did you see the most recent one about the opiates?

129:08
No. Brother, you're going to want to pull this one up. They just proved that and

129:14
Israel admitted to it that they have been lacing the flower with oxycodone

129:20
to those civilians. It was in the last like four days that came out. I just put a video out about

129:26
it. Go check that out. Type it in and you'll find it'll come up right away. They literally admitted and and here's

129:32
the best thing, too. There was another report that came out about them gunning the people down, the civilians at the at the uh aid sites. And guess what Israel

129:39
said? I h you know what? I'm going to find this because I have it in my freaking phone. Look at this, dude. Wow. There's a Yeah. 4 days ago. There's

129:45
a whole bunch of reporting on it. Yeah. Watch this. Um, type in here. I'll

129:51
let me do this, actually. Uh, let's see.

129:57
That is depraved, dude. And that's after bombing the entire thing to rubble. And

130:04
like, what was the report recently that over 400,000 civilians cannot be located? Like we have no idea how many

130:10
civilians they have killed. They they're they so the the reports say 50,000 but they're thinking it's more

130:17
they as in well the reports is in that's how many are confirmed dead. They're saying close to 400,000. Exactly. And and that's on top of the

130:24
ongoing war where they had like like for almost the entire occupation which

130:30
is like 70 years they have had hundreds and hundreds and hundreds uncounted numbers of Palestinians in prisons with

130:37
no charges with no trials with no due process with no rights. Like they had more hostages in Israel from Palestine

130:44
than Hamas took on all of October 7th all along. And like obviously what Hamas did on October 7th sucked too. That's

130:50
horrendous. That's horrific. like super [¬†__¬†] up. And I love that the BB Files showed the footage raw

130:56
and showed how raw it was and how [¬†__¬†] up it was on October 7th to remind you that yes, both sides can commit

131:03
atrocities and it's atrocious both ways and you don't need to embellish it with like madeup stories about beheaded

131:08
babies or babies in ovens or whatever else. You can just show the truth and that is horrific enough. Agreed.

131:13
Right. Yeah. I'm trying to You have to hear this to believe it. I'm gonna I'm gonna pull it up because you literally have to

131:19
hear the words to believe that they actually said what they said. But it's um they basically Israel came out and

131:25
said lessons learned um from from what they're doing. I got to find this. I

131:31
have to find this and show it to you because Yeah, because that's so my my initial thing when I look something up like that is I look for who's reporting on it and

131:38
how much reporting on it is there and then I start digging into what does it all say and I immediately notice like a

131:44
there's a lot of reporting on it and then I look into who's reporting on it and I didn't I I'd have to look longer to be like, "Oh, for sure." But it seems

131:51
pretty obvious that this is going on. No, it's and it's there's a lot, dude. There's a lot on it. Um

131:57
I I can't I'm not going to try and look it up right now. Anyway, it I'll find it later and I'll post it in this video,

132:02
but basically what they said was Israel admitted to doing it. They admitted to gunning down the civilians. They've and

132:08
they and the whole thing was we know they're gunning them down. And in quotes, it was lessons learned. That's what they said. That's what their

132:14
response was. Lessons learned. Well, the problem with Israel, well, one of the

132:19
pro one of the problems with Israel over here for me is that Israel is not only a

132:25
whole moral quandry, but it's also a testing ground for

132:30
ideas. Um, and the West Bank is where a lot of this happens. And we're all we all talk about Gaza so much, but we all

132:36
we are ignoring the West Bank so often right now because in the West Bank there's a different captive population

132:42
that they are experimenting on in many ways. Um, and the most obvious and uh uh

132:48
present one is digital mass surveillance. And Palanteer has been testing software there as well as all

132:54
these other Israeli tech firms that are testing this sort of like digital big brother constant surveillance system. I

133:00
undefined

133:01
think theirs is called Blue Wolf. So, this is something I feel like a lot of people don't know about and I would love

133:06
for you to explain it more because I think Palunteer and the connection there and understanding the mass surveillance

133:12
system that's already in the West Bank that's basically a testing ground for the Americas. That's super important. So, kind of break that down for the

133:19
average person to understand. Um, so the West Bank and Gaza are distinct entities

133:25
at this point that have distinct semi-political structures that are basically uh non-effective

133:32
intentionally. And Israel has worked hard to cultivate non-effective um governments in the two zones

133:38
differently. And so in the West Bank there's all these little territories that Palestinians like own uh separated

133:45
by all these Israeli zones that they own that the Palestinians it's [¬†__¬†] up. Um

133:50
like it's already a problem just the way it's divided the way it's ruled and then the settlements that are illegal that

133:56
are ever encroaching that Ben Gavir and Smootrich two of the highest ranking officials in the Netanyahu government

134:03
right now both come from illegal Israeli settlements and there's more and more every day. Yeah. And Smrich actually is one of the

134:08
settlers that moved outside the borders of his own settlement in order to settle more land. And right now there are

134:13
ongoing reports of more villages being burned down by Israeli settlers moving

134:18
further and further into Palestinian land because that is the ultimate goal is all of the land, destroy Amalcch, take all of the land for many of them.

134:25
Um not necessarily all of them, but definitely for the settlers. Um which is like the farthest right extremist of the

134:31
nation. Yes. But in in the West Bank there is this policy of containment and

134:37
surveillance for Israel's safety obviously where they have there are cameras everywhere every street corner

134:44
huge banks of thousands of cameras and you can look this stuff up. Look up West Bank Israeli surveillance. Look up West Bank Israeli uh technology and the whole

134:51
world of surveillance technology has operations going on there. Like Google has offices there, Palunteer has offices

134:58
there. Everyone's everyone's on it. Yeah. Yeah. Um I see I didn't know that. Yeah. And these things uh have changed

135:04
over time throughout the conflict. It it's like in terms of exactly how much of American company's presence is there

135:10
right away. But um the reason is because you have a captive population that has basically no rights. Um is is a two-tier

135:17
justice system that you can kind of have free reign with and they have all the excuses to run digital mass surveillance

135:22
on them as though they were enemy assets, as though they were all terrorists. And that's what they do. And they have this massive program of

135:28
cameras feeding into facial recognition software that are basically you need a testing ground for a digital mass

135:35
surveillance state. And right now the West Bank is that testing ground that is extremely valuable to the global tech

135:41
industry that is all racing to develop these technologies. And the Israeli tech industry is one of the most powerful in

135:47
the world, one of the most advanced in the world. and they have an explicit policy that they export their

135:53
intelligence assets out of their NSA which is called unit 8200 and they export intelligence units out into the

136:00
private sector to found private companies. Um and these companies like

136:06
there are dozens and dozens that we know of are repeatedly embroiled in scandals.

136:11
One of them was the NSO group which found which created the Pegasus spyware software that was made famous by uh when

136:19
Jamal Kosogi got chopped up in the embassy because they had used Pegasus spyware to infiltrate his phone because

136:24
it's a zero click. Um it infiltrates your phone without you clicking any links, no text, no no nothing. You just

136:31
like it's in your phone all of a sudden. You can't tell it's there. It can control your phone, take all your data, take your location, turn on your

136:36
cameras. Allegedly, it could basically completely take your phone over without you knowing at And the CIA created that?

136:42
No, Israel created NSO group, which is exun 8200. It's one of these Israeli uh

136:47
intelligence units that got exported to a private company called the NSO group. They developed Pegasus software and then they sold it all around the world for

136:54
like a million dollars a pop and it was used to kill Jamal Kosigible by someone.

137:00
Um but then just more more recently just last year this whole scandal broke out

137:05
in Italy around this software called Paragon which is very much a descendant of Pegasus from a different company. Um

137:12
so the spyw wear was called graphite and it was developed by a company called Paragon who Ahood Barack was one of the

137:19
co-founders um along with Ahooden the ex commander of unit 8200 um more good dirt

137:25
for them and what they were doing is they were using the paragon spywear to essentially sell dossas on all the

137:31
highest biders and infiltrate the Italian government but also Lord knows exactly what happened and it's still ongoing but it kind of is getting swept

137:37
under the rope. Um, and I haven't checked back in on it in a month or two, but if you look up Paragon Spywear

137:43
Italy, um, you'll find all sorts of reporting, including things like the Vatican being in on it. There is like,

137:49
uh, the Italian police started, they bugged the offices where this was happening, and they recorded uh,

137:55
instances of Israeli uh, intelligence assets coming to the offices and tasking these guys that were Italian people with

138:02
jobs for them. And apparently there was a conversation recorded where they the Vatican wanted a deal that was a

138:08
million-dollar project to get some dossier on someone or something. But it's all very fuzzy. But what we do know

138:13
is that another unit 8200 group, another like you know Israeli tech export

138:19
company that is being used as though it was a private company to do intelligence operations and then when they get caught

138:25
it's like oh it's just a private company. Whoops, no big deal. Even though Ahood Barack, the guy that was like Epstein's handler, just so happened

138:31
to be a co-founder of it like so. And and then Peter Teal is connected to

138:37
it because Peter Teal owns Palunteer and Palunteer how explain how Palanteer is connected to Palunteer took investment money from

138:43
Jeffrey Epstein directly. Um well uh yeah I'm 90% No, I think you're right. I think I

138:50
remember reading that. But also how are they connected to Paragon? They're not they're not connected to Paragon. They're they're just in this

138:56
same genre of like this new era of tech firms. Palunteers founded by Peter Teal

139:02
and Alex Karp and a whole bunch of money that came from lots of places. Jeffrey Epstein being just one of them. But they have tech in the West Bank,

139:08
don't they? Uh yes, they test stuff in the West Bank. I I'm not entirely aware of the extent of that. Um but uh Alex Karp and

139:18
Peter Teal both have very awkward stances on Israel that are very uh hard to hard to watch because they know how

139:23
unpopular it is. They know how dumb it is. Um, you can look up their stances that from their own mouths of Peter Chib

139:28
saying like I I basically just defer to Israel Israel

139:34
the way he just like short circuits. And Alex Karp is even even whack even more whack where he is just like our like

139:41
there's a quote of Alex Karp saying on stage our technology is used to kill people.

139:48
He's very weird. Um, but Palunteer, you got to mention while you're talking

139:53
about Palunteer, and I wish I'd known more of this like two years ago when I started because it takes it took me a long time to learn the depth of all of

139:59
this. Peter Teal is like JD Vance's one number one backer, right? Yeah. Peter Teal inspired JD Vance to

140:06
get into tech and then he funded his entire political career. And I like what I've seen JD Vance say. I like what I've

140:12
seen JD Vance. He seems like a family dude like but that's exactly the kind of guy that you would want to put there in the

140:18
exactly the kind and maybe like I don't know maybe JD Vance is like secret skull and bones controlled opposite like a

140:24
whole like you know secret agent. Maybe JD Vance is actually who he is and he thinks he's and he's doing good and he's

140:29
a good guy and he's just doesn't really like maybe he's been selected for that reason and there's favors and hooks in

140:35
him and there's stuff that like you know later on down the line JD you're going to get called some kind of the idea that some people

140:41
are just too good. They just don't see the nefarious actions around them. I just can't help but notice Peter Teal funding his entire political career,

140:47
being good friends with him, literally uh the tech industry, it wasn't Peter Teal, but there's reporting from

140:53
multiple sources that puts um David Sachs and and and other tech

140:58
billionaires suggesting to Trump that he choose uh JD Vance as his running mate.

141:04
and this Netflix documentary that just happens to come out. He gets his book deal that he there's questions about

141:11
whether or not he wrote it. I suspect he didn't write it all, but it's very hush hush. And then Netflix picks it up and

141:16
makes a documentary all about him right before Oh, hey, this brand new dude is now your vice president.

141:22
Not not to mention all the connections. I mean, this is the nerd in us, right? But have you seen all the connections with Palunteer and like Lord of the

141:28
Rings? Oh, yeah, dude. I mean, the Palunteer is a very obvious metaphor. Yeah, the seeing stone that you can see

141:35
anything, but when you look into it, you see the worst thing possible. Well, it corrupts your soul over time,

141:41
right? And I mean, I was actually just talking to a real Lord of the Rings nerd uh two days ago, and she was telling me

141:47
about how in the original Smar like the way back lore of the Lord of the Rings, they weren't always evil stones, but

141:54
once they got corrupted by Sauron or something like that, like in in the Lord of the Rings series, the Palunteer is

141:59
very much a tool of corruption that you can see everything and you get turned to evil the more you look at it. The more you look at it. And then

142:05
there's the whole thing about like the the dragon. Um, what is the thing about

142:11
uh what's the dragon's name? The big smog. Smog. There's something about smog's mountain or something. I can't remember.

142:16
The lonely mountain. I read it like yesterday. Uh, it's the name of the mountain is what it is. I think it's the name of one. It's not the Lonely Mountain. It's a

142:22
different name, but it's the name of one of their initiatives. Yep. And it's the initiative for the military. Yep. And I can't remember what it's called,

142:28
but it's crazy. And then also, uh, was it Peter Teal or JD Vance that founded Anduril Capital?

142:35
They're very into their Lord of the Rings names. Yeah. Yeah. It's just a whole rabbit hole. And like Peter Peter Teal and

142:41
here's the thing is that like it's all gray areas and it's all it's there's two sides to every coin because I'm sure that Peter Teal comes across as a smart

142:47
guy. I'm sure that when you meet him in person, it's like you go to these political conferences. You go to Amfest and you meet these like, you know, Conc

142:54
influencers and you're perfect. Yeah, you can totally have a perfectly rational wonderful conversation with these people. Some of them probably

143:00
super nice. Right. Right. Um, like for example, I've got a lot of sources in the Daily Wire and a lot of people that

143:05
know Michael Nolles and Matt Walsh in my life that I know relatively well or a little bit or a lot, you know?

143:11
And everything I hear is that Michael Nolles and Matt Walsh are wonderful humans. Like totally the nicest people

143:17
ever. Totally great guys. Um, but that doesn't necessarily mean that all their

143:22
takes are great. That doesn't necessarily mean that they're working for a company that you love. that doesn't necessarily mean that they're

143:27
not going to compromise values that you hold in their own way. That's like, you know, like hell, there's people that like Ben

143:34
Shapiro still, although I have a hard time finding him. But um I I I just mean to say that like

143:42
people within that world might meet Peter Teal and think he's a great guy. Yeah. But at a certain point when you're

143:48
founding companies, when you have this kind of power, when you're leveraging this kind of money, you have to look beyond is he a great guy? like what are

143:55
they actually doing? What do they stand for? Who are they working for? Who are they working to do that? It's necessary.

144:00
undefined

144:00
It's your job. At least if you call yourself a journalist. Yeah. You know, if you want to be a cheerleader, cool. Be a cheerleader. If

144:06
you want to be a Trump loyalist, be a Trump loyalist. Just don't call yourself a journalist. No. Right. Don't act like some Yeah. Don't label

144:12
yourself something you know you. To be fair, I don't really call myself a journalist either. I'm more of like a commentator comedian. Like I'm more of like a [¬†__¬†] talker, conspiracy theorist.

144:19
Like Yeah. I don't know what I am. Yeah. Like like I would call Whitney Webb a journalist, right? Like

144:25
I literally tell everybody I'm just conspiracy theorist. It's safer that way. But man, all right. So what's the

144:32
answer, Ian? What's the answer? Like you know, is is there an answer? I I I feel

144:37
like the last uh you know, the the se the last several months and everything, I've gotten more

144:43
to a point where I feel like I'm quote unquote like I hate to say this cuz I hate the terms, but it's like black.

144:49
Yeah. And it's just like I I'm kind of at a place where I do just believe that maybe everything is controlled. And it's

144:54
like even to the point where they kind of give us some victories and give us some wins to think that we're here. And it's

145:00
like I you know that that comes from a very there's no hope um paradigm. But at the

145:06
same time the way I look at things I'll tell you me first. I the way I look at things is like if it is truly controlled

145:14
and there isn't really anything we can do about it, you have to focus on the things you can control.

145:19
There you go. You, your family, your loved ones, their lives, their safety, their, you know, do

145:26
your best to be a good person. Be a good person for people around you. Serve your community. And like I know that sounds

145:32
really cliche or whatever, but like it's the only thing I can come up with because it's the only thing that truly is in our control if everything is

145:39
controlled. But what's your opinion? Um, very similar. Uh, it's easy for it

145:44
to seem hopeless and it's easy to get overwhelmed. And the more of this research you do, the more of this you learn, the more doom scrolling and

145:49
rabbit holeing you do, the more it does feel like, holy [¬†__¬†] we are so screwed. Um, especially like I'm researching for

145:56
a whole deep dive on AI technology, the robots, the drones, all of it right now,

146:01
and it's so dark. But I was talking to my girlfriend actually

146:07
last night about this before the fireworks about how like the honest

146:12
truth is that the world might be screwed, but like I have put myself I'm

146:18
very fortunate. It's not like a lot of luck is involved, but I put myself in a place where I'm not really worried about my future. Like you can I I'm feel good

146:25
that I can take care of myself, right? And what I and I say that to say that that is replicable for basically anyone

146:33
basically anywhere in your own way. Like if you can do it, anybody can. No, I don't mean that anybody can do what I do and what I did. What I mean is

146:40
that everyone can look out for themselves and their community, their family first. Because ultimately, you don't change America by like tweeting at

146:47
Trump. You don't change America by arguing on Twitter. You don't change America by like these grand plans as just us regular

146:54
small people, right? You change America is a nation of us. We are America. We are the nation, right? And you change

147:01
whole nations. You change whole cultures by changing individuals first. And so like yeah, some people can change a lot

147:08
of individuals. And if you have that power, if you have that influence, whatever you've got in your life to change as many minds as you can to be

147:14
better people, do it. But you can always change yourself and you can weather any storm and you can become the like

147:20
anything you can imagine. And so ultimately, yeah, it comes back to first take care of yourself and make sure that

147:25
you're good, right, with God, healthy, happy, and have a goal. Have a have a quest, have a have something challenging

147:32
to achieve. Do hard things. Become a strong person. Go to the gym. Eat well.

147:37
Do build do stuff, right? Build take care of your family. Do the same for your family. Protect them. Build

147:43
build safety and security. Build wealth. Build capability for your family. Build community. Work outwards, right?

147:50
change yourself first and then change those around you and then change those around you. And if the more of us that

147:57
do that, the more our communities change from the bottom up, the more we all change from the ground up. And that's what's going on with and and just as an

148:04
example, the Israel conversation right now is complicated. It's messy. It's vitriolic. It's tragic. But it's

148:12
happening because everyone's eyes are being opened on their own in their own world with their own phones, with their

148:18
own screens. and and the way that you see that conversation shift it it can't

148:23
be stopped and we're going to go through it all together figuring out what we all believe because everyone's minds are

148:28
being changed on that individual level and so but that's important it's super

148:33
important it's still important to talk about it it's still important to I I had somebody ask me and I'll ask you the same

148:39
question I had some and then I'll answer it I had somebody ask me the other day if you know that there's really not a whole lot you can do to change things

148:46
why even bother doing what you do. Why even bother spending so much time and

148:52
money and effort talking about these things and ranting online or or or having these conversations or whatever

148:58
if you know that there's really not a whole lot you can do. Why not just stop and go focus on the things that you know you can control? And I'll ask you that

149:05
question and then I'll tell you my answer after. Uh my answer is a version of God in the sense that um if you're

149:11
going to die anyway, why not kill someone? If they're going to die anyway, why not kill them? And the answer is because there's right and wrong in this

149:17
world. And because the world, like as a young person that was not raised with

149:23
religion, for the longest time, my criticism of religion was uh why all the

149:28
evil in the world if God loves us, right? And the way that I answer that question personally is that God did not

149:35
put us here. God did not build this world was not made for it to be easy and

149:40
fun and safe and good. This world was made for it to teach us what we need to learn and for us to all grow through

149:47
what we need to grow through and be what we need to be together collectively to build the human race to where we're

149:52
going to be. Y what we all are together even beyond time at the end of all things. And the battle between good and

150:00
evil is in all of us and it's in all of our culture. It's in all things that humans are and make. And it's you're

150:08
never going to defeat evil and evil is never going to defeat good. And just like look at the most downtrodden people

150:15
that should have failed and should have fallen, but ultimately rebellion always springs back up. Ultimately left will

150:20
never overtake right, right will never overtake left. Like ultimately these dualities are built in. And your job being on team good and team God is not

150:27
to win. Your job is to fight. Because the point of humanity, the way I see it,

150:33
is not for us to become perfect, but for us to strive. Because the point of

150:39
learning, the point of growth is never to to to end because there is no end. That's the nature of the journey. That's

150:44
the nature of life. And the nature of fighting for good is is not to vanquish

150:49
evil. It's to fight evil because there will always be more evil. There will always be more more men, right? And and

150:55
so your job is not to save the world. It's not to change the world. Although those are noble intentions that you

151:01
should intend to do, but realize that your job is just to do

151:06
your best, to be your best, and to to when you're on your deathbed looking back, will you be proud of your

151:13
contribution to the shared experience, to the God, to

151:18
the reality, to whatever it is you believe that you're about to go to, to that heaven when you go on to that next

151:24
realm and and and meet God, speak with the rest of us, meet your relatives, whatever it is you believe, Are you

151:30
going to be contributing a life that you're proud to walk up to the mall and say, "Look what I did."

151:35
Well said. I love that. That and I have a very similar answer. My answer was also kind of the same. It's like if if I

151:41
don't, who will? Like, you know, there's a lot there's a lot of people in the world that don't want to be involved and

151:47
don't want to know the truth, quite frankly, and don't want to share it and and they're afraid of it or whatever.

151:52
And it's like, I've been given a gift of having a community of people and having influence. And if I don't use that

151:59
influence for something that's good, to be able to, you know, shine light on evil and fight for good, then what do I

152:00
undefined

152:05
have it for? And it's and it's very much aligned with what you said, like I when

152:11
I first started speaking up in 2020, when I decided to kind of flip everything upside down, fully aware that

152:16
it might end everything I'd built for 10 years because I had a pretty decent, you

152:21
know, place. Um, it was it came down to what will I tell

152:27
my boy 10 years from now? What will I tell him if I knew I should have said something and I didn't?

152:32
Yep. And it does. It comes down to good. It comes down to good and evil. And it comes down to

152:37
whether or not you understand the importance of doing that. But I think it just also comes down to be aware of the

152:43
evil. But it's it's being aware but not consumed. Yeah. And instead of allowing yourself

152:48
to be consumed with the evil and all the things you know about the world, you you turn that into action like we've talked

152:54
about in things outside of that with our families and things like that. So yeah, I agree. Um

153:00
yeah, find God. Whatever your God that you need is, find God. Yeah. Chase God and always try to be better.

153:07
Well, dude, this has been awesome. Um amazing conversation. It's been so much fun. I want to just open it to you

153:13
though really quick because I know you have some things going on with your buyer app. Yeah. And things like that. And it's I I don't

153:19
even say the reason I say this is because it's not even so much to let you promote it, but it's because it goes along perfectly with what we're talking

153:25
about. You're doing things right now that help us all of us in that in that

153:30
pursuit of the things we can control. Yeah. Small ways. So talk a little bit about that real quick. So, we're we're beta testing an

153:36
app right now that we're going to release in about a month that takes all the like Black Rockck grocery store aisle like kind of videos that I used to

153:43
make and made for a long time and turns all those spreadsheets about like finding family and founder own brands in

153:48
the mega corporate mass of the grocery store and it turns it all into an app. So, you can just scan a barcode and find

153:54
out like, oh, first form owned by Andy, right? Right. Yeah. Yeah. So, first form owned by Andy. You

154:00
undefined

154:00
scan it, founder owned. Right. You scan Fiji water, you'll find out who owns Fiji water. You scan anything in the

154:05
grocery store, you'll find out who owns it. But you'll also get all the other stuff all the other apps do, like what's the nutrition in it. You can filter out

154:11
ingredients. You can filter for allergens. If you're on a diet, you can filter out dietary stuff you don't want. You can create shopping list and pantry.

154:17
Like you can you can turn it into a whole bunch of other stuff. Or you can just learn about who owns everything. And you can like it's so fun now that

154:24
we've got it working right is like you can scan something and find out who owns that thing. But then you can like bop

154:29
around through the different products and through the different ownerships and like learn a shitload about how this world really works and how the products

154:35
in our lives really work. And so that's in beta testing right now and it's going to go out. It's there'll be a free version that is like because there's a

154:41
lot of AI stuff that we have to pay on the back end to function that AI. So there's a free version that's a little simpler that has like the scanning

154:47
features and some of the basics. Then there's a there'll be a paid version that'll be pretty cheap that um will have all this other AI capability built

154:53
in. So stoked. And it's called Buyer. And you can go to buyerapp.com right now and you can sign up for the beta test

154:59
right now if you want at berapp.com. Super stoked on it. And if you just want to wait until you can download it on the app store and the play store, it's

155:05
probably about a month away. Um right now we're at July 5th. So I would assume that June, July, August, uh definitely

155:11
by September. I don't want to put too much pressure on my developer because it's just me and two other dudes and

155:16
we're just doing it all ourselves with no investment. No one's buying us. There's no there's no sponsorship or

155:22
like buying ratings or any [¬†__¬†] like that. everyone go [¬†__¬†] themselves. It's just information. That's awesome.

155:27
Um, we won't sell out. So, there's that. And if you want to keep up with me, I've got a website called I was going to uh cancel.com if you want

155:34
like some shirts, some merch, stuff like that. Um, and I've got a my YouTube channel is where I'm really focused right now.

155:40
Social media can go [¬†__¬†] itself. Um, my YouTube channel is Ian Carol Show and I am so stoked on on my development

155:48
of getting better at YouTube right now and like which that's a lot because leveling. Oh, I learned so much from that whole team.

155:54
I got new equipment. I I'm doing it in a whole new way. And I'm super excited. I'm about to get real creative and do some new styles of videos and just start

156:00
playing around and trying to like dive into big ideas and go deep. So, I'm stoked. That's awesome, dude. I can't wait to see it. I mean, what you've been able to

156:06
