## Summary

This blog post introduces a photobiological recursive loop as a quantum reflex arc system that integrates ultraweak photon emissions (UPEs), mitochondrial activity, microtubule (MT) dynamics, and circadian timing to drive cellular processes and consciousness. Rooted in first-principles reasoning, the model highlights how life evolved under sunlight but is disrupted by modern artificial blue light and electromagnetic fields (EMF), leading to diseases like demyelination and cognitive decline. The post challenges centralized science with a decentralized, quantum-based perspective.

## Key Points:

1. Photobiological Recursive Loop:
    - UPEs, UV-range biophotons (200‚Äì400 nm) from mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytochrome c oxidase (CCO), act as quantum signals linking mitochondria, MTs, and circadian rhythms.
    - The loop involves stoichiometric precision with light (UPEs), water (deuterium-depleted water, DDW), and magnetism (oxygen‚Äôs paramagnetism), driving mitosis, myelination, and consciousness.
2. Mitochondrial UPE Generation:
    - Mitochondria produce UPEs during oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) via the TCA cycle, with ROS and CCO emitting UV light that enhances electron transfer and ATP synthesis.
    - EZ water in the mitochondrial matrix amplifies UPEs, influencing membrane potential and ATP production, supported by the Vitamin D receptor (VDR) on the inner membrane as an evolutionary ‚Äúbrake‚Äù post-Great Oxidation Event (GOE).
3. Microtubule Dynamics and Centrosomes:
    - UPEs excite tubulin in MTs, enhancing polymerization and quantum coherence (per Orch-OR theory), critical for mitotic spindle formation and axonal transport.
    - Centrosomes, nucleating MTs, act as quantum checkpoints triggered by UPEs, ensuring cellular division precision.
4. Circadian Timing:
    - Sunlight (UVA, blue via melanopsin) entrains the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), regulating clock genes (CLOCK, BMAL1) and Rev-erbŒ±/Œ≤, which align TCA and urea cycles for nitrogen metabolism and UPE production.
    - Misalignment disrupts mitochondrial function and consciousness.
5. Systemic Effects via Blood:
    - UPEs spread through blood, altering RBC zeta potential and blood flow, acting as a biophotonic network influencing MT dynamics and mitochondrial positioning across tissues, especially the brain (20% cardiac output).
6. Leptin Resistance and Quantum Failure:
    - Leptin resistance, linked to nnEMF and blue light, reflects a quantum failure with low UPE fidelity (220 nm, overlapping mtDNA/DNA emissions), impairing the leptin-melanocortin pathway and consciousness.
    - UPEs‚Äô high orbital angular momentum (OAM) enables vast information transfer, disrupted by modern tech.
7. Modern Disruption by Blue Light:
    - Artificial blue light (400‚Äì500 nm) suppresses melatonin, degrades melanin, misaligns circadian rhythms, and damages MTs and mitochondria via ROS, reducing UPEs and ATP, leading to demyelination and altered consciousness.
    - Compared to a welding analogy, blue light is an incorrect electrode causing defective cellular ‚Äúseams.‚Äù
8. Evolutionary and Therapeutic Insights:
    - The loop evolved post-GOE with hemoglobin adapting to UV for aerobic metabolism, optimizing UPE-driven cellular precision.
    - Restoring natural sunlight (UVA, red light) realigns the loop, enhancing mitochondrial function and cognitive clarity, countering nnEMF effects (e.g., vaccine lipid nanoparticle damage).

## Conclusion: 

The photobiological recursive loop, a quantum system evolved under sunlight, couples UPEs, mitochondria, MTs, and circadian rhythms to sustain cellular health and consciousness. Modern blue light and nnEMF disrupt this balance, causing quantum failures like leptin resistance and neurodegeneration. Kruse advocates for sunlight exposure to restore the system, setting the stage for tackling the hard problem of consciousness in subsequent posts.
