00:03
What's going on in DC right now is you have two parties that are basically on the same team backed by a group of

00:08
people in the desert who's getting us to fight wars. And was I really excited about Trump? To be quite frank with you,

00:14
I wasn't. Why? Because I know who backs him. I know how he got into New York. I'm from New York City. The royal family

00:19
and their bankers or how we got into this show. They're the real enemy of the people in the United States. They

00:26
just have now, how shall we say, middlemen in between. And those middlemen, they have that Star David flag that sits in Israel and they're

00:33
trying to get guys like you to shut up.

00:41
You're an American. You seem to be very, very passionate about the country. You seem to care a lot about our financial

00:46
system. I mean, your reputation obviously comes before you, but why El Salvador? Like, why'd you come here?

00:52
Freedom. There's more freedom here. There's more security here than there is anywhere in the United States. I mean, I

00:57
you heard before you came in. One of my friends was like, "Well, I think I need to get a letter from you because I I

01:03
just spent a whole bunch of money yesterday getting ready to do my driveway here." And we had to cash some

01:09
Bitcoin in to get money because the guys need money to buy stuff. We had to write a letter just in case, you know, they

01:16
got pulled over and there was money in the car, so they didn't want to have any problems. That's a remnant, the PTSD

01:22
from what it used to be like here in El Salvador. um before B Kelly came in and I'm like

01:29
that's the reason they still have razor wise on they still believe that the old system the old rules are in place

01:35
they're not there anymore and when I came down here in Blly's first term he was only in for about a year I looked to

01:42
my left and looked to my right I said I feel safer here than I do in New Orleans or in Florida I said what am I worried

01:48
about and then when you started to see the exception regime come in and what

01:53
did he do if you're a bad ombre you go to seek. Well, we didn't have that rule.

01:59
You know that we didn't have that rule in the United States until what? Just recently. But if we really want to be

02:05
critical of the leadership in DC, we were told during the election cycle that day one, Cash and Bondi were going to

02:12
put people in jail. How many people have been put in jail? Zero. Like, if you don't have any accountability,

02:18
you don't have any respect. That's what savages are looking for. Like when you're a freedom maximalist, that's the

02:24
kind of things you're looking for. And when I came to El Salvador, I actually saw accountability.

02:30
Now, you just saw Trump potentially tap some of Belly's cred by

02:37
bringing CCOD people here. And you saw Christine Gnome is down here making, you know, fake videos for the right-wing

02:44
media back in the States. that stuff. I think people still know it's

02:50
But you have to for the people to have credibility in the United States, they

02:56
have to begin to put some of these criminals in jail. Firing them from their jobs isn't enough. We need the

03:01
people, the architects of COVID, the architects of the economic collapse, the architects of the messenger army

03:07
platform, the architects of all the things when they shut the economy down. Those are the people that need to be in

03:14
jumpsuits. And no, I don't really care about the rule of law. Why? They didn't

03:21
care about the rule of law when they let all those criminals in through the border, right, at all. The DOJ was set

03:27
up for that invasion. And you still have activist judges working in the United

03:33
States to allow these people to stay and keep them. But when you know that the

03:38
game is that rigged, then you have to apply the same rules to those people, put them in jail, walk right into

03:43
Congress, and arrest them. and then sent them to Secott and say, "Look, you have the right to an

03:49
attorney. Go hire one. Let's adjudicate." Like, I don't understand why we're not playing the same game.

03:56
When that happens, then I'll come back to the United States. Makes sense. I feel like, uh, you know, being in the US, something feels really,

04:04
really off right now. I, you know, when it comes to even I voted for Trump, I

04:09
We had to What are you going to do? Vote the other way? You're voting for Maduro with a dress? Yeah. Well, actually,

04:15
maybe even worse because I feel like then there would have been no way out in the future. There was going to be no way to to get out of it. But well, they take your guns away and soon

04:21
as they take your guns away, I mean, that's the last step as far as I'm concerned. The reason why I think you

04:27
feel discontent, and this may be wrong for me to say, everything else has been stripped out of the Constitution, out of

04:34
the economy. You only have one thing left. And you remember what Thomas Jefferson said. There's a reason it was

04:39
the Second Amendment. People forget, I told you this before we started this podcast. 250 years ago, we pointed guns

04:47
at the king of England, the strongest army in the world for a 3% tax. 3% and

04:54
so we could worship God the way we wanted to. That's guys on the farm put their pitchforks down, picked up a

05:01
musket, and went after the best army in the world. And guess what? We won. You know that history. So I look at it like

05:07
this from that whole event. We get the documents, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution,

05:13
and the First Amendment's gone. You're part of the new First Amendment. That's what from what I've gathered from you

05:20
being in my house setting this up that you're very interested in freedom of the press cuz you understand that it's a

05:26
break on bad government. So, the next break, and this is the one I think why

05:32
your generation is uncomfortable, they may have to use that break. And

05:39
we're getting much much closer to that that the guys that are in DC are that big a problem. We now know that we have

05:46
$37 trillion in debt because they used the money, set up an NGO that was built after they killed Kennedy, sent it to

05:53
Ukraine, and now they're getting the money back. So when you want to know why Warren and Schumer have all these

05:59
millions of dollars on $140,000 salary, oh, it's not too surprising how

06:05
it happened. The problem is people are acting like this is a shock. Look, I got

06:11
gray hair and a beard because I've seen the nefariousness go on for 50 years.

06:17
You're a young man. You haven't lived through it all yet. Yeah, you're in the mix now. You're in the ring. You've been

06:24
in Mara Lago. You've been down with Steve Bannon. You've been with those people. But how nefarious. And do you

06:31
know who's aligned with who? No, you don't. So, this is like Sunzu's book. I

06:39
I told people on a podcast that I just did a a little while ago, everybody needs to get a copy of the Constitution,

06:45
and everybody needs to get Sunzu's book and read it. What's going on in DC right now is you have two parties that are

06:51
basically on the same team backed by a group of people in the desert in the Middle East. Okay? Who's getting us to

06:58
fight wars and everybody in the United States is starting to wake up. That's really what's going on. So go read

07:04
Sunzu's book. You're going to see one of the little lessons in there. These people will fight over ashes of a

07:12
country instead of caring about the country. So that means they give two  about you or me. And that's the

07:19
reason why everybody, including the gray beards and the young good-looking guys like you, are starting to realize

07:28
the military is now being used against us. In other words, we're Central America. We're B Kelly. We are now what

07:36
used to happen in Europe. We are the hunted. And when you realize for the first time

07:43
that you are the hunted, you have two choices. You can do Circus Maximus, worried about

07:50
who the Titans are going to pick as the first pick, watch Netflix, go to

07:55
Starbucks, or you can decide to do something about it. maybe come tell Salvador and sit

08:00
down with a guy who's about more pissed off than any American that you're probably ever going to get. Why? Because

08:06
guess where I'm at? I didn't think it was safe enough to stay in my country under a Joe Biden regime, under a Camala

08:13
Harris regime, under a Chuck Schumer regime. And was I really excited about

08:18
Trump? To be quite frank with you, I wasn't. Why? Because I know who backs him. I know how he got into New York.

08:24
I'm from New York City. I know who backs him. who backs well who backs him? The

08:29
the Zionist. And when I say Zionist, I don't want anybody to think that this is the Jewish Mafia. That's a different

08:37
podcast. The Zionists are the British imperialist. These are the people that have tried to get a Lloyd title back

08:43
from the United States since they lost it in 1776 when we shot at the king. And

08:49
who and how did all that start? It's a long story, but it starts in 1837 when Queen Victoria takes over and she sets

08:57
up this society called the Fabians. They eventually morph in to the Council of Foreign Relations. Now, who are the

09:04
Council of Foreign Relations? I don't have to tell you this. I think you know, but that famous little podcast that we

09:09
were talking about that I did with Cali Means, I outed him to the rest of the world. His father is one of those

09:16
people. He is one of those people. Who are those people? Those are British royalists loyal to the crown that will

09:25
do everything possible to get Russia and the United States back. That's who they work for. And when you understand what

09:32
Israel really is, it is a colony that was won in World War I, Palestine. And

09:38
then what happened? the king at that time, which was King George, the forerunner of Edward VII, who was who

09:45
had to abdicate. They set up a plan to make sure that we would get another world war. What people don't realize is

09:51
Allan Dulles and John Foster Dulles, two people involved in JFK's assassination.

09:57
John Foster not so much. They were Fabians. They were council foreign relation people. They worked with the

10:03
guys on the Treaty of Versailles to guarantee that we'd get into another war. Why? because they didn't get back

10:09
America and they wound up losing Russia in World War I to the Bolevixs who are

10:16
really your big problem. Bolsheviks are kind of who own media and that's the

10:22
reason why you got this huge problem in your industry and you don't realize

10:27
after I don't know let's say 120 125 years how this evolution has morphed and

10:33
I believe the reason that your generation suffers is because they're really bad historians. They tend to read

10:39
books that are not firsthand accounts. They're not first principal thinking.

10:46
they they're told what they're supposed to believe. And when you get that

10:51
historical account, you come to believe certain things. It's no different than when you go to school, they teach you

10:57
mathematics. You believe what the third grade teacher tells you. It's like when you go to Sunday school, you sit down

11:02
and the preacher tells you what to believe and you believe it. Ultimately, what has to happen to you when you

11:07
become an older person like you? You got to start questioning that. the reason you're here in El Salvador. She's like,

11:15
Jack, there's a void. Why is there a void? The same reason I'm upset is

11:21
actually the same reason you're here in El Salvador. You have to realize that everything is a fractal. Everything is

11:26
tied together. You're a string in this universe. We all are. And we know there's something

11:33
fundamentally wrong. But are you a savage enough to be able to put down

11:40
your media or put something in the can to tell 360 million people back home

11:47
that this is worth fighting for? Is what's left in the United States is what the founding fathers gave us worth

11:55
losing your life over? I think it is. But I can tell you the last 6 years, no.

12:02
I didn't think it was worth me staying there. I don't think it's safe for me right now to be in the United States.

12:07
Why? Cuz I've been talking. Before we continue in this amazing conversation with Dr. Jack Cruz, I want to remind you guys this show is kindly

12:15
supported by My Pillow. Now, My Pillow are made in America most comfortable pillows that money can buy. And right

12:21
now, you can get them at the warehouse pricing. What happened was a bunch of companies ended up trying to stick it to

12:26

12:32
supply. Now, what's great for us, even though it's bad for them, is that we get $50 pillows at only $15. Plus, if you

12:39
want to get the queen size, it's only $18.88. And if you go a dollar more, you get the king size. Plus, you can get

12:45

13:32
promo code Elijah Elijah ah Let's get back to the show. This whole thing started with one of my

13:38
good friends, Rick Rubin, asking me to do a podcast with a guy who I really didn't want to talk to cuz I didn't trust and that's how it all started. And

13:46
I knew once I started talking, it was going to open up a can of worms and it was going to lead to kind of where we

13:52
are now. talking about how America went off the rails, how science was told, how DARPA was a big part of that, how World

14:00
War II, the war that the Fabians got us into actually was morphed also to suit their

14:08
needs, you know. And you know, we're here now on April 2nd, 2025,

14:14
and I think about Trump just saying in the last five, six days, I want to have an olive branch with King Charles.

14:22
That's the worst news I've ever heard in in the world. That's the last person he should make friends with

14:29
because the royal family and their bankers are how we got into this show. We we should have no quarter for

14:36
them at all. They're the real enemy of the people in the United States. They

14:42
just have now, how shall we say, middlemen in between. And those middlemen, they have that Star David

14:47
flag that sits in Israel and they're trying to now get guys like you to shut

14:54
up and not talk about them. And they do a pretty damn good job. I'm not going to lie. The amount of money that that I've

15:00
lost and the amount of opportunities that have been taken, including shows destroyed, slander in the media. I mean,

15:07
it's it's pretty interesting because I'm not a big guy and I'm not I'm not tooting my own horn. I was surprised and

15:13
the reason why I went so far down the rabbit hole and why I'm now in El Salvador in a foreign country with webcams setting up to talk to someone

15:19
who I know knows more more things than me for those that are listening at home or you listen on on audio podcasts is

15:24
because I I believe when I watch those guys in Ukraine getting abducted off the street

15:32
they're dying for nothing. Okay, it is they are dying for nothing. They're dying for something just not something you and I believe in.

15:38
Correct. Nothing they believe in. They don't want to go. Correct. And I have two young boys like 5 months and two years. And I don't

15:45
believe that our country, at least what it is now, is worth dying for. But maybe

15:50
what we could make it into could be worth dying for. That that idea of what it is meant to be, is something that is

15:56
worth something. My family was here before the revolution. My family has fought in almost every single war. And I

16:03
sit here and I think this is the first generation of people who who have not joined the military, who are not serving the government because the government is

16:09
not serving us. And it something is is really off. And I want to get some clarification from you. How did we get

16:15
here though? How did we get to a point to where our government is confusing? And just like we're seeing in in all

16:22
western countries, the governments are working against the heritage people, the people who founded the country, they are

16:27
against the white people in the country. And at this point, it seems like they're just against their own citizens, flooding their borders with all these

16:32
insane third worlders, North Africans who share none of our culture, religion, or values. It seems like it just

16:38
happened overnight, but I know it didn't. No, it it actually didn't. It started a long, long time ago. And

16:46
that's part of the history lesson that I've been giving people on podcasts probably the last two years. It goes, it

16:52
starts in 1837 when the people around Queen Victoria said, "We need to do something, you know, to get this back."

16:59
So, who did she first go to? She went to a group in Saks Coa because, you know,

17:06
that's where she comes from. And it was all these merchants that were there and they were disaffected in this one area.

17:12
Most of them turned out to be Jewish immigrants. And they were so persecuted

17:18
under her rule. She convinced them to go to the United States. They go to the United States and what was the goal? The

17:24
goal was to fulment problems for the new country. Remember the new country at

17:30
that time is after all the BS that happens with the Brits and also with Napoleon and all that jazz. And those

17:38
people basically are the real reason we get the Civil War. And when the Civil

17:43
War comes in, those are the people that actually get one of the American patriots to actually shoot and kill our

17:50
first president. That's Abraham Lincoln. That was also done to get back the

17:56
eloidial title that Queen Victoria lost. Now, many Americans probably don't know

18:01
that Queen Victoria, prior to the last queen that just boxed, she lasted a long

18:06
time. She last all the way uh until um 1900. and but she started early on.

18:13
These people became Fabians and eventually they morphed into other groups in the United States. Those

18:19
people became the very famous merchants that wound up building and becoming

18:25
robber barons in the United States. That's the Harammans. That's the the Bush family, people like that, the

18:32
Vanderbilts and the Rockefellers of course. And that's where their

18:37
allegiances lie. Um, and it continued to grow and grow and grow and get bigger

18:43
and bigger and bigger. What happens from there? You get World War I. Now, if you

18:49
remember anything about World War I, this wasn't our bag of tricks. This was the royal family, which Queen Victoria

18:55
tried to get involved with. She married off everybody in her family so that she

19:00
thought that would keep the peace. It turned out that all the cousins wound up hating each other. World War I starts.

19:07
Queen Victoria dies right around about 10 or 15 years before that and when the

19:13
war breaks out you basically have cousins fighting against each other. So that's George Wilhelm and the Romanoffs

19:19
which is Nicholas at the time and they align against each other and what

19:24
ultimately happens is that most of the monarchies of the day get taken out in

19:31
Europe. There's very few left. In fact, uh, some really bad mojo happens in that

19:37
war. They lose Russia. And what happens? The Bolevik Revolution occurs in the

19:43
middle of World War I. This is not what was planned by the the monarchy. And

19:49
just to clarify though for people because yeah, sometimes people do get conspiratorial where they act like everything is planned and everything is

19:55
is going according to plan. just like this is like they have this plan for the world and things like the Bolevik

20:01
revolution keep getting in the way. Well, this really got in the way of the plan because okay, eventually the

20:07
Bolevixs kill the Romanoffs which nobody in Europe saw coming.

20:12
That was a wakeup call that the people could rise up and actually kill the

20:18
elite class. This was this was a big wakeup call and part of the reason that

20:24
I brought up what I brought up to you earlier. We're going to talk about the United States, I think we're kind of in the same situation right now. Okay. And

20:33
I think when you understand what happens after World War I to get control of the

20:38
situation, guys like Allan Dulles and John Foster Dulles are pushed in with

20:44
keys, the economic guys. And what do they do? They try to make sure financially that the the Germans are

20:50
punished for doing the things they did. They couldn't do anything to the Russians because the Russians were on

20:56
the same side as the king of England at that time. The problem is they were no

21:02
longer together. They were now enemies because of what happened with the Romanoffs. So the whole treaty of

21:10
Versailles is a plan to make sure we have another war. So what happens

21:15
between the two wars that many people in America are really not good with? They

21:21
don't realize that King George of England through World War I dies. His son is going to assume the throne. This

21:28
happens in 36. His son is Edward VII. Edward VII and his father before his

21:35
father died came up with a plan with the Rothchilds to start another world war.

21:40
And their plan was to try to get the United States involved in this war early and also get the Russians involved. So

21:48
who did they prop up in 1933? a guy named Adolf Hitler. This was actually a British imperial plan and there was

21:55
something done with the Catholic Church, specifically two popes, Pope Pas the 11th and 12th and they came up with

22:01
something called the transfer agreement. The transfer agreement was to take all the Jewish uh citizens in Europe and put

22:07
him in Palestine. Why did they pick Palestine? Turned out in World War I, one of the the aortionments of the

22:13
Treaty of Versailles is England was given Palestine as a captured colony because that came from the Ottoman

22:18
Empire who lost the war. So the Rothschilds and the king came up with the idea that's formalized in a document

22:24
that I think most people know. It's called the Balffor Declaration was written on November 2nd, 1917. And the

22:30
Balffor Declaration basically said that this will be the land of the Jewish people. And they did not care that more

22:38
Christians and more Muslims live or Islamists lived in that land then. And

22:44
in the time that they got that from 1917 all the way to the Second World War, they couldn't get Jewish people to want

22:50
to move out of Europe to go to the desert. So they came up with this idea called the transfer agreement. And who

22:55
is the parties here? The bankers, the royal crown, and the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church was promised they

23:02
would get control of Jerusalem and uh the Zionists would get control of the

23:07
rest of the land. What the plan was is to take all the Jews from all of Europe and put them in Palestine while this war

23:14
was waged so that they would be taken care of. The money that these people had would be stored in the Rothschild bank.

23:21
They enlisted some of the people in the United States. These are the Zionists uh that are in the United States that

23:27
that are Fabians that come all the way back through this whole thing with Lincoln. Those those are the people that

23:33
we talked about. The Haramman brothers, the Rockefellers, the Dulles brothers.

23:38
So what happens there is they hire Hitler to do their bidding. Hitler then

23:45
proceeds to invade all the different places in Europe. The goal was to make sure that people like Stalin and the

23:53
king of England um didn't know these this plan. The the king knew what was

23:58
going on, but Stalin didn't. Where did the plan almost blow up? Blows up in 60 in in 1936 and King George dies and his

24:07
son takes over. His son loves Hitler. Like you can go back in history right now on YouTube and pull all this data

24:13
up. He was forced to abdicate the throne. He wasn't even in one year. Why?

24:19
Because he took his girlfriend, who was an American, who was divorced, and guess what the media of the day blamed it on?

24:27
Well, he can't be the king because he's marrying a divorced woman named Wallace Simpson. The real issue was there was

24:34
pictures of Edward VII uh with Hitler

24:39
from 1933 all the way through the declaration of the war in 39. That was the real

24:47
problem. So he had to be sidelined. So he he was forced to abdicate. And where

24:52
did he abdicate? He stayed in in Paris. That's where the rest of his life was

24:58
spent. So who takes over? His brother. And his brother wasn't really ready for

25:03
the throne. Who is that? That's Queen Elizabeth's father. His nickname was Birdie. He also was a King George. and

25:13
he rules through the first world war. You guys know how the first I should say the second world war. The second world

25:20
war doesn't go well for Britain again. They don't get America back. They couldn't convince America to get back

25:26
in. They tried to. The Roth trials hired Winston Churchill who was a drunk who

25:33
had debts. They paid his debts off and said, "You have one job. your job is we're going to replace Neville

25:38
Chamberlain with you and your job is to get America into this war fast. Turns

25:43
out America didn't really want to come into the war. Why? Because we're in the Great Depression. Wasn't a great time

25:49
for guys who are poor that are looking for bread to pick up a musket and go shoot at people who are Europeans. We

25:57
weren't we weren't into that. So what do they have to do? They come up with a scop. The SCOP is Pearl Harbor. per

26:05
harbor. The Japanese come in. Everybody knows that story. FDR has to go to war.

26:11
We go to war. What happens during the war? This is probably the single most

26:16
important thing for Americans to understand about World War II.

26:23
General Groves, who's the general who runs the Manhattan Project, he's not the guy fighting the wars in Europe, he is

26:30
tasked with hiring scientists to build an atomic bomb. So, who does he talk to

26:38
first? Someone who we've already talked about. He talks to Alan Dulles. Tells Alan Dulles, I need the best physicists

26:44
in the world. Where are those physicists located? They're in Europe. They're all Jewish. So, Operation Paperclip technically

26:51
begins before the war. Everybody who's a historian is told like when you went to school, you learn about Operation

26:57
Paperclip after the war. They never tell you before. But this movie came out where they let it slip that General

27:04
Groves and Dulles went before Oenheimer was even selected to go get these

27:10
scientists. And that's what happened. If you want to know how the Zionist got

27:15
ultimate control of the government, it starts right here. This story is very important. Why? Because eventually when

27:23
Ben Gurian is the the first uh prime minister of Israel, he famously tells

27:29
American president which is Eisenhower and JFK that we gave you our Jewish

27:35
scientists to build this bomb and we now would like a say in what's

27:41
going on. That's how it originally started. So in other words, the Zionists

27:47
have a quidd proquo with our government. Now, initially, the two presidents we talked about, they

27:54
pushed hard back on this, but who didn't push so hard back on it? This is really

27:59
where America goes off the rails. You have to know a little bit about what General Groves did. He did one of the

28:04
most amazing engineering feats. He built an atomic bomb when we had no science to back this up in two years. He does it

28:11
secretively. and he builds a silo where he puts all these different scientists that he brings from all these different

28:17
countries because they're experts in different things. He doesn't allow them to talk to each other except the

28:22
meetings that he holds. That's the framework he builds and eventually it's so successful. They build a bomb from

28:30
there. That's how we get handover in in Washington. That's how we get Oakidge in Tennessee. That's how you got Area 51

28:36
out in the desert where all these things are put together after the end of the war. Um, it turns

28:43
out from history that you didn't learn in your book, we didn't need the atomic bomb to end the war in Japan. But Groves

28:50
spent all this time and money building this. He was hellbent on dropping those two bombs. He had help from the Zionists

28:58
that not yet were Israeli because remember, Israel doesn't form until 1948

29:03
to actually force the issue not only with FDR, but really force the issue

29:09
with Truman. when Truman takes over after FDR dies and what happens then? Uh

29:16
Eisenhower, Patton, General Marshall, all the ones that you know about that

29:22
won the war in Europe with the Russians, they are pissed off at Groves. Why?

29:27
Because they believe that he's going to try to usurp the power and say that the bombs won the war. And

29:35
that's eventually what guys like you are young are really taught in school that the atomic bombs played that kind of

29:42
role when they really didn't. Why is that big for you to understand? That was

29:47
the impetus that forced Eisenhower right after the declaration was signed on the USS Missouri to force Groves out of the

29:54
military. What did Groves effectively do? He actually has to leave the

29:59
military in 1947, but out the door because he was very influential in

30:05
American politics with some of these Zionist to replacing Henry Wallace with Truman. That's how Truman gets to be

30:11
president because he wants his guy in. What's the main goal of General Groves in this whole issue is to make sure that

30:18
he has Fabian, Zionist, and friendlies in the government. And where does he put

30:24
those people? Specifically in the government in the new CIA. And that that

30:31
act is written in 1947 literally a couple of months before Groves is forced

30:36
out. Why did this turn out to be the biggest mistake that Eisenhower and

30:42
Harry Truman ever met? Harry Truman knew that Groves was lying to him and and

30:48
Jimmy Burns, who's the South Carolina senator, was really important in this whole mix because he realized he was

30:55
getting hoodwinkedked. And what Groves did is all the how shall I say brain

31:00
power that was in the joint chiefs in the military was transferred into the

31:06
CIA. Do you know who is one of those CIA directors? Because you have to know where the CIA comes from. O and I OSS.

31:14
Those are the people there. George Kennan is that big guy. But who is Kennan tight friends with? Another

31:20
Fabian. Kennan's a Fabian, but Allan Dulles is. Allan Dulles eventually goes on to become CIA dire who becomes

31:28
his right-hand man, a guy named Richard Helms, which will become really important in the JFK affair. Why? Helms

31:34
is the one that gets rid of MK Ultra Foxes in 1973. Helms is the one that

31:40
forces Jim Garrison to have to put Klay Shaw on trial for the murder of JFK.

31:46
Denies that he's a CIA asset until 1979 after he's out of the CIA and and Klay

31:53
Shaw's dead. Can I ask you something real quickly though? You know, kind of going back a little bit on on how this happened. Obviously, you know, you

32:00
talked about uh the Zionist British plan sort of blowing up right in 1936 or back there. Yeah. But then we have so we have

32:07
Jews in the United States that are kind of playing this role of causing problems or raising families up and raising up uh

32:13
sort of this resistance to sort of break up the cohesion or or whatever you were saying directly there. Then we have these Jews in uh in basically in Russia,

32:22
right? This Bolevik revolution. These are also mostly Jewish people. Mhm. And then during World War II, right, the

32:28
generals in the West sort of ended up teaming up with with Stalin, ended up teaming up with these these people in in

32:34
um in Russia to just wasn't just Russia.

32:40
It was actually in the United States, remember? And I I I don't know if you remember this cuz you may not have listened to the podcast. The big link

32:46
that ties the generals to the Jewish mafia here, the Myer Lansky link, is

32:51
actually General Gross. Why? Because the rumor is that the Germans were sending Uboots into New York Harbor. Remember

32:58
why they called it the Manhattan project. That's where the project was based. It's in the in the 63rd floor of

33:04
the Empire State Building. So you had two wars going on, one in Europe and one in Japan. And they got reports that the

33:11
German Ubot were coming in New York Harbor to find out why Dulles took all these Jewish scientists. No one knew. So

33:18
who did they hire? General Gross hires Meer Lansky with FDR's approval to go find out what's going on. And they do.

33:25
They find 19 spies. One of they kill them all except one guy. That's Kurt

33:30
Plotin who's uh turns out to be a SS surgeon. He tells Meer Lansky all the

33:36
stuff that Hitler's doing. He knows intimate details that you wouldn't know. So they don't kill him. So Groves gets

33:43
this information and so does FDR. So the link between why where is Lansky from

33:51
Ukraine from Russia he's tied and left Russia during the Bolevik revolution

33:57
1911 1912 so that's the link that's made

34:02
there it's not just the link Russia uh to the the English link is also in the

34:09
United States and you need to realize the people who become the herammans and the Rockefellers here those are the uh

34:17
direct descendants of people that came from Sax Coburn and Gotha. That's the

34:22
real link. These are all the same people that came over the same time. What? What?

34:30
Yes. Well, they were all You have to realize

34:35
they were all around at this time. And and if you really understand this the

34:41
the history here that the Bolevixs took control. The Bolsheviks hated the king

34:47
of England more than you can imagine. That's why they killed the Romanoffs. Okay. The interesting thing is the

34:53
alignment, the political alignment. The Russians, the Boleviks specifically had

34:58
no idea of what King George's plan was about Hitler. And you have to realize

35:04
why did the Russia pay attention to this? Remember, they're eastern quarter. The same that you know is going on

35:10
today. Why Putin has a huge problem with Ukraine. It's very easy to march straight into St. Petersburg or to

35:16
Moscow when you don't have that that border secure. That's the reason why Putin famously told uh Tucker Carlson

35:24
say, "Dude, we've had two world wars where people walked right in. We're not going to play that game again." The same

35:32
thing is playing its role here. So the Bolsheviks want to make sure that they have a nice border, but what they didn't

35:39
know is that the king of England is planning to prop up the people in Germany to walk right through. That's

35:47
effectively what the plan is in World War II. So the link is to keep America

35:53
and Russia blind to this covert plan. If you want to know what the real scops is,

36:00
it's actually World War II. The entire war is a scaps to get back a lodial

36:05
title. And the goal of the people around FDR is to convince him to go to war

36:12
fast. And to his credit, even though he was a Jewish guy, he didn't run right in. He didn't.

36:19
Big time. Absolutely. He did prop up Russia big time. And I think the reason you have to

36:25
realize that is I think FDR is the one president that realized Russia wasn't

36:31
the real enemy. But FDR also wasn't smart enough to realize that his ally,

36:37
the king of England, was. And there was enough data going on for FDR to know

36:43
this. Why didn't he know it? What's he sidetracked by? You're you're you're a

36:48
young guy, but you know your history. We're in the middle of the depression. Okay. So, the United States is falling

36:53
apart. FDR's reason to mandate is the New Deal. Like, get us back on track. He doesn't want to

37:00
be dealing with foreign relation  He's not interested in that at all. He doesn't know what's going on between Chamberlain Churchill and the

37:08
abdication of the king in 36. He has no  clue. And he's looking at this

37:14
like, "This is a problem I don't need." Okay? I got big enough problems, you know, doing public works projects here

37:20
in the United States, trying to get people off of bread lines. But what eventually happens is when Hitler rises

37:26
up, which is something that nobody in America actually thought was really going to happen, and it does. Do you

37:33
think that FDR really was fully aware that Henry Ford, the Rockefellers, the

37:39
Bush family is actually working with the King of England to actually prop this up? Just realize you'd open up German

37:46
tanks and you'd see Ford. You'd see GM. Prescott Bush was the banker that

37:54
actually hid Nazi funds. Well, let me ask you this. This is a very important detail because obviously, you know,

37:59
Henry Ford's recorded as being heavily anti-Semitic or he was anti-Jewish. Obviously, they would be propping up

38:05
Hitler or they'd be propping up somebody who they agreed with ideologically, right? That they they thought you missed the point. You missed the

38:10
point. What was the plan to put all the Jews in Palestine? That's good for a guy like Ford. In

38:16
other words, let's take all the Jews out of circulation, put them in one country. That's exactly They were all behind the

38:23
transfer agreement. And just so you know, the transfer agreement has a coin minted. You can find it today in London

38:29
with the swastika on the back and uh the church's seal of approval on the back.

38:36
So, you're missing the point here. They want to take this Jewish problem and put

38:42
it all in one place. And the Rothschilds and the king said, "Well, we got this place that's empty. Nobody wants to live

38:49
in the desert." They couldn't even convince the Jews in the beginning to live in the desert. That's where the transfer agreement comes from. That

38:56
blows up in their face. But guess what? That's what we're dealing with now. That's what you two guys are the most

39:02
interested in talking about. But I don't want people to think when I say Zionist

39:09
because I know what it how it plays in media, it's looked at as an anti-Semitic or anti-Jew thing. No, it's not. It's

39:16
actually British imperialism, which is the key issue here. They're the real

39:21
enemy. They are using a religion as a shield. That's their human shield. And

39:28
so that they continue to pull out their plan. You see it happen now. King George's, I should say, King Charles,

39:34
who's his best friend, Claude Schwab. They've been friends all the way back to Kissinger's time. Has it ever struck you

39:41
as kind of bizarre? You remember in Trump's first term when King Charles

39:46
wasn't King Charles, he was just the prince. He wouldn't even shake Trump's hand when he met him as the president of

39:52
the United States. What does that tell you? He still has a disdain for the colony. We're looked at as a colony even

40:00
to them today. And they are still hellbent on getting us back. And guess

40:07
who they're using? They're friends in Palestine. Cuz remember where Palestine

40:12
comes from? It's an imperial colony won in World War I.

40:17
That's where their friends are. So this is like this is not really for me but for the people listening something that I feel like people do not understand

40:24
then is the connection between that and then the control of let's say Apac or

40:29
these uh foreign relation committees that come from directly from the colony or come from Israel is that then British

40:35
imperialism taking back control of our government. You got it, dude. You just did the brain surgery diagnosis. And

40:41
that's what you need to understand. When I told you earlier, and I don't know if we were even recording then

40:47
that what I would do if I was the president, I would walk into Congress and I'd arrest everybody except five

40:52
people. Those are the people that take no money from APAC. Why? Because those are invaders. They're loyalist to the

40:58
British crown. They Here's the craziest part. This history has happened over the last 100 years. The people that are

41:04
taking Apac money don't even know that King Charles and his family are behind this. That's also by design because it

41:11
gives them deniable plausibility. So you have to realize the Apac problem, the

41:17
the fine problem that we just got in Florida. We the people have a duty to understand

41:23
that. And when Musk and Trump came out and said, "Look, we should or Massie is

41:28
the one that really said it. We should not have any dual passport people in. We shouldn't have anybody who is loyal to

41:36
Israel over the United States. I'm going to tell you everybody should have to take an oath to that. And if we find out

41:41
that they do the things that I told you about earlier that that puts you on a

41:48
C150 and gets you a place in SECOT, you come down here with Blly, he'll take care of you. And then you let the

41:54
politicians back in DC adjudicate that in the courts back home. Why? because

42:00
they are working as foreign agents and they're not documented. And this goes straight to the heart of the real reason

42:07
why we just found out that the CIA and the Zionists were involved in killing

42:12
JFK. Why? Because what was the big fight between JFK and Bengurian about? It was

42:17
about you used our Jewish scientists to get the bomb. We want the bomb. We want your help getting the bomb. And what did

42:24
JFK say? We'd like you to register as a foreign agent. That blew Bengurian's

42:30
mind. He couldn't believe that a young Catholic had the balls to say that to

42:36
him. But guess who warned him? 1961 in January. Eisenhower's farewell speech.

42:44
Go take a look at it sometime. The part of the story that you didn't let me finish before was what happens when

42:50
Grove goes out. Grove goes out and gets private money from people that

42:55
eventually would become Silicon Valley. He becomes more weaponized. He builds

43:01
this huge industrial military complex outside after he's been exiled by

43:06
Eisenhower. Who's the president after Truman? Eisenhower for eight years. Who's his vice president? Nixon. And

43:13
who's outside building this behemoth of the industrial military complex? Groves.

43:18
And what does Groves do? He takes the same idea in the Manhattan project and silos everybody. Do you know what that

43:23
that uh industry is now called in the United States? It's called DARPA. And you know who brought it back in? Who had

43:29
to bring it back in? Eisenhower. Do you know why? Because the Russians used the

43:35
same technology that you're addicted to right here now. Instead of building Google and Apple, they build the space

43:42
program faster. And they put Sputnik up in 1957. And guess what? Everybody in Washington DC could not believe what the

43:50
Russians did. So guess what happens? All of a sudden Eisenhower has to do a

43:56
Miaopa and goes to Groves and Groves says, "Yeah, well I got this guy Howard. I got these people in Silicon Valley.

44:04
All of them are Zionist. All of them are now supporting Israel big time.

44:10
And Eisenhower has to bring them back in. So what did we basically do? We now have the Manhattan project rebranded as

44:15
DARPA on steroids with billions of dollars. What immediately happens? Every defense

44:22
contractor is now on the tit of the federal government. The taxpayers are

44:27
now beholden to them. The killing of JFK is the cement on this

44:35
whole story. That's the truth. And until people in the United States

44:40
understand that that event is what really has catapult you to today, the media became the propaganda arm for the

44:48
industrial military complex to carry out the goals. Where did they get that idea?

44:53
Edward Bernay, you know who he was? Edward Bernay is the um relative of

44:59
Sigman Freud who comes up with a theory about writes a book in 1921 called

45:05
propaganda. Do you know who used that book? Joseph Gobles.

45:11
How do you like that? That gets incorporated into Madison Avenue

45:16
advertising. Then the government uses it in the CIA to use it against you.

45:21
They've been cultivating us since the 1950s for the event that you're in now. You

45:27
want to know how smart and nefarious these are? Let me tell you something. If

45:33
you think that this plan started in 2016, 2020, 2008, 1992, you're a

45:40
idiot. Simple as that. This this started in 1837.

45:47
And it's the same guys running the same game. The only difference now is they have partners. But just remember who

45:53
their partners are. They're also British imperialists. Okay? They just changed their name to

46:00
sound a little bit more Middle Eastern. That's all they've done. And they've been working on behalf of the people in

46:07
the World Economic Forum and the Royal Family ever since. And they're funded by the richest people in Europe. And

46:14
they're funded by the richest people in the United States. Those are the bankers. And if you're an American and

46:20
you've read the Federalist Papers, what did James Madison and Thomas Jefferson

46:25
warn us about? The biggest problem that we'll face as a country is the bankers.

46:32
And and who eventually gets us to cave, it's Alexander Hamilton. And you guys

46:38
know how that went worked out. Aaron Burr, the vice president of Thomas Jefferson, winds up killing

46:44
this guy. And what was the fight about? Because this fight in the Federalist Papers goes all the way through. We

46:50
didn't have Bitcoin at that time. So we used the best money changing system we had. Guess whose that was? the

46:56
Rothchilds. Where'd that come from? That came from Napoleonic Wars. That came

47:02
from all the that happened in 1812. So when you ask me,

47:08
Jack, how did we get there? You can see it's not really how I should say a simple random walk. You have to know

47:16
the history inside and out. And the reason some of your audience may be saying, "How does this dude know this?"

47:23
Remember what my day job is? I'm a boardcertified neurosurgeon. When you come to me with a problem, you're paying

47:30
me to figure out what the root cause of the problem was. So don't think that I can't use that skill set and use it in

47:36
history as well and use it in money and use it to understand why a young man

47:41
like you, good-looking, is going to come to El Salvador because most of the people that are your age are nihilistic,

47:48
afraid, and don't really understand what's happening to our country. That's

47:53
my answer. Well, you know, and this is these are going to be like some basic questions, but I I think due to the rise

47:59
of popularity of someone like Hitler today, when I meet young people, they are very pro- Hitler. In fact, the

48:06
number one like trending political uh I don't know what to call them, reals, memes, shorts, right? It's always sort

48:12
of like white supremacist neo-Nazi um propaganda. It really We shouldn't call it that though. We

48:17
should call it SCOPS of British imperialism. Why? We now we're doing this podcast at a time where a Malay who

48:25
just so you know is a Jew just admitted but that Hitler actually escaped. He

48:32
didn't kill himself and he lived in Argentina for two decades after the war

48:38
and he had two children. How about this? How about the savages listening to this podcast realize that the real issue is

48:46
he was a foot soldier for the monarchy. That's all he was. So if you think

48:52
that's a great thing to aspire to, you're a idiot, too. You need to realize who's the wizard behind the

48:58
curtain. It wasn't Hitler. It's the monarchy. It's the bankers. It's the

49:04
World Economic Forum. Those are all their partners. When when Claus Schwab told you you're going to be poor and

49:11
you're going to be happy about it, they actually really meant it because that's the world that you guys feel disaffected

49:18
in right now. The reason why they need to keep a guy like you with tube socks stuck in your mouth so you don't have

49:25
conversations like you're having with Uncle Jack right now. That's the real story. And when you see people in the

49:32
United States, no matter who they are, doesn't matter if it's Randy Fine in Florida or Donald Trump brokering a

49:38
deal, ask yourself the question with this perspective, why is this happening?

49:45
What why what am I missing in this story for this to make any sense at all? And

49:51
then you'll understand why Massie can stand on the bully pulpit and say, "I don't take any AP pack money. I don't

49:58
have a handler." and why all of a sudden the Zionist both in the United States

50:03
and in want to put him out of business. They don't want him to get McConnell seat. I mean, you guys, you you two know

50:10
this already. Why is McConnell in? Because the covert army that's in the desert stealing votes from him to got

50:18
him in. He's not even popular in Kentucky when you go. But Massie is very popular. I've actually been on other

50:24
podcasts where I told people, "What could guys like you you two do?" leave Virginia and go move to Kentucky and

50:31
vote for Massie. That's the truth. That's the first step in what happened

50:36
say in 1770 in the United States when farmers put the pitchforks down and said, "You know what? We're done with

50:42
this We need to remove every British imperialist that's in our

50:47
government." That means we need to remove every person that gets Apac money. I don't care if they have a

50:53
dinner. They and that tells you that that politician is bought and paid for. So

51:00
remember the industry you're in, the reason you're pissed off is they control

51:05
all the purse strings in your industry. I'm telling you the same story is true in politics. They are using their power,

51:12
their financial power in fiat to debase the money to pay people off. That's the

51:18
reason why when Elon Musk magically says, "How is it possible that Nancy Pelosi has $280 million on a $250,000

51:26
salary?" Well, when you understand the story I'm telling you, and then you understand where the NGO was getting the

51:34
money came from us, that's how brilliant this plan is. They

51:39
stole the money from us, ran it through another country, sent it back, and their politicians are working for them. And

51:46
who's getting paid? The architects, the arch the the accountants of this thing. These are the Meer Lanskies who are

51:52
legalized. They are the accountant for Political Inc. Myer

52:00
Lansky was the accountant for Murder Inc. I would tell you that Benjamin Netanyahu and all of his friends like

52:08
fine in Florida, like Pelosi, like Chuck Schumer,

52:14
they are the accountants that are propping up the system that's making you upset. I But I'm pissed. And here here's here's

52:21
where I I got history for you. You're not more pissed than me. Okay. Okay. Well, maybe we could have a competition because I'm

52:26
I got three decades on you, bro. Okay. I'm not going to break the law. I'm not not I'm not I'm not saying I'm going to break the law, but I'm at the point like where you said where if the law isn't

52:33
broken eventually, I don't think we're going to fix this. And I'm feeling like it might need to be I need I need you to go read the

52:38
Constitution because you're going to have to go read um the Constitution.

52:44
What it wasn't the Constitution, it was in the Federalist Papers. Thomas Jefferson famously said, "If a

52:50
government passes a law that's unconstitutional, you have a duty as a patriot to fight against it." Here's the

52:56
crazy part. Do you know that there's a case in Supreme Court history, I think it's 1837,

53:02
Maybach versus someone, somebody will fact check me on this because people usually do. Do you know what the Supreme

53:08
Court actually said? Reiterated Jefferson's position. So guess what? You're not breaking the law by shooting

53:15
at the government. Just so you know that. Why? Because they've done far more in your short life than you could ever

53:22
imagine. Now, they me way more than they you. But just realize that we're all getting the same

53:29
got it. And that's why we should be mad. That's the reason why I told you before we started this podcast, what gets me

53:35
the most mad that we now have a messenger RNA platform that actually

53:41
came from this time, 1951, that we're injecting 1 million kids, the

53:47
future army, that are going to take care of these nefarious They're

53:52
making sure that they're disabling them early. That is how nefarious they are.

53:58
And guess what? The people that are in charge right now in DC, they're complicit. They are Fabians. Do Do you

54:05
remember when I did the Danny Jones podcast? I know he does. What did I say to Cali means? I said, "You may not

54:12
think that your father's affiliation with the Council of Foreign Relations and the fact that you worked for three

54:19
different industries, all tied to Zionist platforms who are involved in psychological warfare.

54:25
You may think I'm a dumbass, but I guarantee you that you're gonna be in Washington DC.

54:30
What happened? Yeah, he's he's actually in He's now a special adviser. But guess

54:36
what? On December 27th, Danny Jones podcast, what did he tell me, you, and the world?

54:44
That I was full of right? And what did I say? I said, "Bro, you're a product of MK Ultra, and I guarantee you

54:51
I am going to continue to out you. Why did Bobby Kennedy get in? He had a

54:57
genulectic casty, my former senator. Gastronurologist totally bought and paid for by the big

55:03
farm lobby lobby supported by who? Apac money. He makes Bobby genulect. What

55:10
else happens there? They got dirt on Bobby. Okay, that's the reason why we got Shumley and his buttplug dildos

55:17
taking pictures with Bobby Kennedy. Now, I thought this is my miaaka. I thought Bobby

55:24
didn't give two about that. You know, when I talked to him, I met with him, shared my law, talked to him with

55:30
Nicole. Turns out that was a mistake, too. It turns out that the power that the

55:36
accountants have over our politicians is vast. Like we need to realize

55:44
that the only way we get this country back is we need a president that has big enough cojones to go in and put

55:52
everybody who has any ties to money that's stolen from us or that gets

55:58
funneled and laundered through Ukraine or Israel needs to go to jail. Like we

56:03
don't even need to have a discussion about it. You put them in jail and then you go right back to the constitution. You know that whole thing there that's

56:10
talks about treason. You know what the punishment for that is, right? Oh yeah. Okay, good. So that is what we need to

56:18
do. Like people say, "Well, we need more laws." No, we don't. Thomas Shererson put the laws on the books. You know what

56:24
we need? We need a Pam Bondi that has balls. But she's a Zionist herself and she's

56:30
outspoken about. You don't have to tell me that. I Is that why? But this is what I want to know then. Is was Matt Gates stepping

56:36
aside? Was that planned or was that because he didn't take Apac money and they couldn't have him in? Was that

56:41
they could they could not have Matt here. Just so you know, this will be a nice tiein for you cuz I think you already know this. But, you know, Matt

56:48
was my congressman, first congressional district in Florida. You know, my clinics in Dustin. So, I wrote him eight

56:55
letters back before I moved to El Salvador. I said, "You need to come to El Salvador." So, you know that he came

57:01
eight times, right? You know, he's been down here a lot. and he took tours of SECOD before CCOD was even filled. So,

57:07
he knew all about it. When he got announced as potentially being the attorney general, I was very excited.

57:12
Why? Because I realized to have someone like that, you'll be able to put the

57:17
real criminals in jail. So, you know why he was forced out? And I guarantee you they got dirt on him. There's no doubt

57:24
about it. Yeah, there's no doubt about it. But yeah, he likes to party, right? Do I think that I have a problem

57:30
with a guy who parties or this and that? No, I don't. I could care less if you do the right thing. Look, all of us, we're

57:36
human. We all make mistakes. If you're willing to fix your mistake or

57:42
your error, I always tell people, it's not a mistake if you learn from it. And I think Matt gets learned from it. And

57:49
he was ready, I think, to truly pull the trigger and begin to help Patriots solve

57:55
this. So, you know, you ask me the question, Jack, why did you move here? Well, here I go from Florida down to

58:01
here. And what am I doing? I'm trying to get my congressman to come visit this savage in San Salvador who totally

58:09
changed his country. Took it back when no one thought he could do it. So why can't it happen in the United States? We

58:16
have track history. We have farmers that beat the best army in the world. Why can't we do it again?

58:22
when he got taken out, that's when I lost all my faith really in Trump. And

58:28
me too. That's what I was going to say when when that when that went down, I went and I saw Pam. They were putting Pam in. I go, they've gotten complete

58:36
hold of the Well, the real big thing was when Weldon stepped back from the CDC. That was a

58:41
huge that was a huge problem. And that that's when I really knew that they had

58:46
serious dirt on Bobby. Um, Weldon as a congressman was a champion, you know,

58:53
for the stuff that I'm passionate about. If you want to know how I got into this, that's the decentralized medicine stuff,

58:58
the vaccine problem and everything else. But when Welen got canned, I was like, and then the real problem was when I saw

59:06
who they put in, like the natural replacement for Weldon would have been Joe Ladapo, who is Dansis guy in

59:13
Florida. I mean, look, Pan Bondi's from Florida. Why wouldn't you go to Latapo? Well, who did they pick? They pick a we

59:21
controlled Biden appointee that is absolutely the biggest British

59:27
imperialist Zionist that you could ever imagine is now going to be running the CDC. Just so you're clear, the CDC makes

59:35
more money from vaccines than anything in the world. So, guess what? She's in charge of making sure that future

59:41
patriots are hampered so they can never shoot at the King of England.

59:47
Got it. That's the real 5D plan that's going on here.

59:54
No. Yeah. Yeah. And and you can't I I'm just going to tell you standing back

60:00
right now if you're a true patriot. No. And I don't want people to get

60:06
inflamed over this. I want you to know what the blueprint is, what the diagnosis is. And then what we do, I

60:12
support media like you who's willing to come and put this idea out in the

60:18
soundwaves. Why? Because there's going to be a lot of young people are going to say, "Why are we listening to this

60:23
doctor who ran away and bailed and is in another country?" Do I need to remind

60:28
you where Thomas Jefferson went when he was trying to figure this out? He went

60:34
to our friends in France at the time. That's why we got the Statue of Liberty.

60:39
Got it. The French Revolution played a huge role in the United States. So you can get inspired somewhere else. And it

60:47
turns out my inspiration came from B Kelly when he put all the bad ombres in

60:52
jail and he went in and he fired his judges and he went in and he got rid of the criminals in government. He did it

61:00
the way a real leader does it. Do you see that in Washington DC right now? Cuz

61:05
you know it's day 70 today, right? Cash, Bondi,

61:11
Bobby, nobody, nobody's arrested yet. Not one person. But you know what? This is where I related to your story because what

61:18
happened was is I went to try to make it I mean, I'm not going to get too much in my life, but to to say my relation to you is that, you know, I was I was

61:25
trying to make it in media and I worked in the big Zionist media and I started I I did it to pursue truth and I started

61:32
questioning certain things. I started wondering why CPAC the Zionist organization of America was, you know,

61:38
sponsoring this, why there was separate, you know, dinners for Jewish people. It was very odd to me as being a pro-American person. And, you know, the

61:46
the bullying started from the left, you know, started from from Mediite and from Daily Beast and the, you know, oh, this

61:51
guy might be anti-Semitic. He asked these questions to straight up denial to where they started writing hit pieces that there is no Zionist organization of

61:58
America. But the website's there. I can go to the website. It actually does exist. And it started getting to the

62:04
point then where it it stopped being the left. It started being the right. I started getting called in the CEO's

62:09
office. You don't believe in identity politics, right? You don't have a problem with, you know, Jewish people in this. I go, no, I I wasn't never said I

62:14
had a problem with Jewish people. I was talking about why is foreign nations money involved in our conservative political sphere. It's a very different,

62:21
you know, you know, standard for saying I have a problem with Jewish people. Uh and then, you know,

62:27
we got to remember these people try to conflate Zionism with Judaism. And this has pissed off a lot of the secular Jews

62:33
too. That's the reason why when people ask me on podcasts and I would tell you the same thing when you get asked the

62:39
question, you have to know the history that I gave you today to understand that this is a British imperialist movement.

62:47
When you understand that, the one thing that you don't have to convince young people of, yeah, we did shoot out our

62:53
king once. I do remember that. And you're basically saying that it's the same game plan again. It is. And I think

63:00
if you focus in on that and call them for what they are because the truth be

63:05
told, I think the religion of Judaism is taking a huge bullet for the Zionists.

63:11
And that's the truth. But guess what? That's part of their plan. The Zionists

63:16
are that smart that they're going to use them as a human shield just like they use kids as human shields in Gaza today.

63:23
It's no different. But you need to understand this playbook because it works. they continue to use it. This is

63:30
but this is where I I realize this is is not just watching on a podcast but experiencing like what you said to where

63:36
when I didn't stop when they asked me to stop and I didn't stop and they couldn't fire me because you're not going to be able to fire someone. It was hard to

63:42
fire Candace. It was hard to get people out. When I saw that, you know, it's hard to not give invites when you work for a big organization. There's no

63:47
reason to deny you. They went to like to just slander and they let people just

63:54
lie and they let people you know an old co-host of mine sue you know sue and

63:59
drag me as you know an abuser and all this stuff and for years and and so when when it all like culminated I went what

64:06
the hell is going on here like why are my neighbors why are my friends turning on me I haven't done anything to them I

64:12
didn't I don't know why this you know these people are allowing this to happen and I did what you did I just told my wife I said let's just go let's go Let's

64:19
go to let's go to Australia where you live. Let's go to the let's go to the Gold Coast and I'm just going to go there. I'm not I'm going to completely

64:24
leave the industry and I'm going to figure out what the hell's going on because I don't understand what's happening. It's too confusing and I'm in

64:32
too much in it to know what's happening. So, I went away for a couple years and I didn't stop producing content. I just

64:38
fired everybody. Took took my own budget down. I go, "Well, you can't stop me from providing for my own family. I know how to do that." And and that's why I'm

64:46
here with you today. I mean, fast forward a couple years. I told my wife, I said, "I'm going to come back to America and I'm coming back and I'm

64:52
going to start a media company and we're not going to take Zionist money and we're not going to be like anti-Jewish. We're not going to be white

64:58
supremacists. We're not going to be neo-Nazis like they want us to be. We are going to find out what the hell's going on in our political system. We are

65:04
going to find out who's real and who's not. We're going to hire young people who are already aware of what's going on instead of trying to get these old

65:10
people you don't know if they're, you know, subverting you. We're we're going to create people instead of hiring people in the industry. We're going to bring them in and we're going to create

65:16
the first mainstream podcast/ media group that is refusing to

65:23
take part in this system. And you know what everyone's told me? You're crazy. You You want to try to raise

65:28
money? You want to try you you want to get an invite anywhere? You want to you want to even open up a booth at one of these conferences? You are out

65:34
of your mind. And you know what? I am out of my mind. I actually am. But I feel like there's no there's no other way to be right now. If you're young, I

65:41
feel like the real insanity is playing into the system. Friends who are like, "Oh, I'll just get a job there at

65:46
PragerU and I'll I'll change it from the inside." No, you won't. I've watched every single friend of mine

65:51
that's trying to play the system, they're getting bullied and brainwashed and they're not doing anything. And so, yeah. Is this kind of insane? Is it

65:58
insane to take some webcams without a production team, which I've never done before. Of course, the first time I've done this in a backpack and fly randomly

66:05
down to El Salvador to talk to somebody who people say is also crazy, but I know is actually not. I know. I know you're

66:10
not. I've seen I've seen critics of yours, but you know what's funny is they've never been able to say why. Never able to say why you're crazy. It's

66:16
just, oh, that guy'sing insane. And I go, but you've but you're but you're not telling me why, right? So, you're not

66:23
you're not telling me why he's insane. And so I think that there's there is hope and that's what I want that's what you're doing and that's what I hope to

66:29
get across to people today is like just don't give up. Well, I look at it like this. When you understand the ethos of the United

66:36
States that the misfits in Britain told the king to go off and then came

66:41
over him, built a very strong country and built great founding documents. And

66:48
the irony is now they're trying to get back what they lost. So I think the misfit idea, the savage idea, the crazy

66:56
idea, remember what Einstein once said about being crazy, being crazy is doing

67:01
the same thing over and over again, expect a different result. So sometimes when the system is so stacked against

67:08
you that you have to be unconventional. If you look at it, that's how we got terrorism in the world. That's that's

67:15
the reason why the Islamists fight the Zionists the way they do. It's the reason why we lost in Vietnam. The

67:23
Vietnamese fought us differently than not. It's like we forgot the message of

67:29
what those farmers that put the pitchforks down. They did the same thing. They didn't march in red coats

67:34
around playing a drum, you know, carrying flags around. They're like, "No, that's not how we're going to do this. We're going to do this a little

67:40
bit differently." So I would tell you if crazy is synonymous with a wiser, if crazy is

67:47
synonymous with sovereignty, when you realize that the blood of thousands of or I should say millions of

67:54
patriots have been spilled because of freedom, then what's the problem with you and I

68:01
coming and doing what we're doing now? Because all we're really doing is sharing ideas. I think I think I'm

68:08
perfectly happy letting the audience think whether I'm crazy or not. Or maybe

68:14
do I have ideas that I can provide answers that centralized medicine can? Maybe you have ideas in

68:22
media where it makes sense for you to put something like this on so that young people understand truly what's going on

68:30
and don't get caught up in all the terms because I think the terminology is actually how the Zionists win. You have

68:36
to know who they're really working for, who the wizard is. The wizard is the monarchy in in England. And when you

68:43
understand that, you begin to say, "Okay, so this makes sense why the we is involved. This makes sense why what's

68:49
going on in Europe is actually going on. They're actually trying to get back to the year 1200, 1300, where the king runs

68:57
everything. Runs the whole show. And who's in the court? Those are the bankers. The bankers are the accountants

69:02
for the whole the whole game. And what are we? We're the slaves that work the fields.

69:07
So the Jews are just pawns in the king's game. That's all it is. And so if you're at the Jewish if you're upset about the Jewish thing, it's like,

69:14
well, you're you're at a smoke screen, which is which I get what you're saying. It's not that these people are not causing problems. They are, but they're

69:20
the front to to to keep the king is telling the king is telling them what to do. And that's the whole

69:27
House of London thing. And you have to remember that ties to every monarchy. But why are they Can I ask you this?

69:32
This is a very side question. I know we don't have a lot of time left, but this is this is what I don't get.

69:39
Why is it then that let's say Hitler what he warned was going he warned about what was going to happen, you know, they

69:44
basically were going to flood our countries like Paris for example with a bunch of North Africans and Arabs and they were going to muddy our white

69:50
nations with with people who didn't look like us, didn't share our values. He loses the war. That does happen today.

69:56
You're saying the king's in power. It's kind of like a jump, but now the king's in power. But the same thing's happening

70:01
in London and England where it's like they're destroying their own island like very very very steadily and very

70:08
rapidly. How could I how could someone believe the king was in power and let's say Hitler was wrong that it's you know

70:14
really the Jews and it's not the king. Uh how could how could we believe that if if the king's letting it happen to

70:20
his own his own island? It's very simple. I gave you the answer early in the podcast, but that's the reason why I'm glad you asked this

70:26
question. I'm I'm very happy you did. You need to go read Sunzu's book. You,

70:31
my friend, have never had absolute power. And absolute power corrupts. The king of England is perfectly happy to

70:38
rule over his island even with it in ashes. Why? Because he is the boss. And

70:44
that is their mindset. Their mindset is we are royalty. We are gods on earth and

70:52
you will bow to us. you will do whatever we tell you to do and if you don't we

70:58
will make your life miserable and that is exactly why they're doing it and

71:03
guess what Sunzu talks about that in his book and remember that book that wisdom

71:10
comes before the Magna Carta don't forget that and the problem is you and I

71:16
don't have any experience in which to draw which is why you asked me the question because we've never been in a

71:23
position of having absolute power. Just remember how powerful this is. You

71:28
remember the the kid that they just got rid of one of Diana's boys with the red hair? I'm blanking on his name. Um he's

71:36
married to Merkel. Oh. Uh Prince Harry. Yeah. Harry. You may not remember this,

71:41
but when he's in boarding school when he was like 15, 16 years old, do you know that he dressed up like a Nazi for Halloween? Yeah, I do remember that. Yeah. I mean,

71:47
I was I don't remember that, but I've seen the pictures. So, this is what I'm saying. The kid has no

71:54
earthly idea. Why? Because he's brought up in a house where you can do no wrong. This is the reason why Prince Andrew thought it was okay to be friends with

72:00
Epstein and do the things that he did with Epstein. Because you're not going

72:05
to get in trouble. You control all the pieces of the game. Everything. And the

72:11
thing is, you and I have never experienced that once. And let me tell you something. When people who have

72:17
absolute power lose it, which was what happened in 1776,

72:22
do you realize for 250 years, they have not stopped trying to reclaim what we

72:28
took from them, from those crazy misfits that you so aptly grouped yourself and

72:34
me into. I'm perfectly happy to be grouped in with those people cuz to me,

72:40
those are patriots that fought for their sovereignty, for their freedom. And guess what? That's really what being an

72:46
American, that's what the ethos is all about. So, do I think that whatever we

72:54
need to do in the future, no matter what it is, you everybody who listens to this

72:59
podcast will have to make a decision. How far am I willing to go so that my family can grow up in the world that you

73:06
know is codified in our founding documents. You just have to realize that the people that are running the show right now, unfortunately, many times we

73:13
put them in, you know, and you and I had this conversation off air before we started. I I fundamentally believe

73:20
elections still do have consequences, but that assumes that the elections are fair and balanced. You and I both know

73:25
that the United States, they're not. And here's the interesting part uh for everybody who's listening to this

73:31
podcast to con consider. Trump doesn't get elected without the Bitcoin crypto bros or the Maha people.

73:39
And then I want you to do a hard stop once you realize that. Look at how many obedient MK Ultra idiots created by

73:47
General Groves voted for actually someone worse or left of Maduro in

73:52
Venezuela and Camala Harris. So, even though I'm not a big fan of Trump, I

73:57
still vote for him um over Camala Harris because if we get her, we're back in

74:04
King Charles Plantation overnight. Like, we wouldn't even have this podcast probably.

74:09
No, we we wouldn't. And that's Well, we wouldn't cuz I I was under investigation from the FBI for wiretapping because

74:16
Yeah. I was an investigative journalist and they were mad about that I uh I was one who exposed like Ray Eps you know

74:22
starting the violence and they kept not wanting the FBI kept visiting me and they kept wanting I kept saying hey you know I have this footage it's public but

74:28
I kept saying I show I can show you Ray eps him whispering at him starting the violence and I could tell them and tell

74:33
them they never obviously didn't want to touch him for a while it's why they didn't touch me and then they opened up at a wiretapping investigation on me

74:39
saying that I you know documenting the the capital riot was was you know aspous to uh espionage basically and I was

74:47
like, "What the hell is What are you talking about? Espionage." Like, I'm doing a favor for the nation. I'm doing actually doing a favor for the

74:52
government. Not their nation. Their nation is over on the island over there. Just so you remember 1908 FBI founded by a group of

75:01
Fabians. See, but this is when this is how you wake up. Like, it's not just like a red pilling, you know, for people to know. It's like when you're when you're living

75:07
in it, and I was. That's my point. You're going, "Look, I'm trying to help my network find the truth. I'm trying to help the government find out who started

75:13
January 6. I'm trying to do the right thing here and then you're getting punished for doing the right thing. They're not interested in the truth.

75:19
They're interested in their agenda. And that's what you need to understand. That's why this media that you're

75:25
getting ready to do, I personally hope you're very successful in doing it. But I think I think you really need to keep

75:32
be mindful that you're going to have to walk the ledge. You're going to have to do the things that you heard about that

75:40
Paul Rivere did. The the people that push back every time that you're faced with some bad mojo. I want you to think

75:47
about those soldiers on the USS Liberty who've had no voice since 1967, since

75:53
Lyndon Baines Johnson allowed the Zionists to turn their guns and take that ship down because the first Gaza

76:01
cleansing was being uploaded by the Russians. I I hope you remember those

76:06
people. They don't have a voice. Several of those guys are at the end of their life. They actually need that story to

76:12
come out. They they need to know that their friends didn't die for any reason

76:20
so that guys like you could go back and maybe get a couple of 30 year olds to

76:25
go, I didn't know that our government allowed that to do. Just so you know, the same president that was complicit in

76:31
killing the third president. We had McKinley in between there, but the third president,

76:37
but our own government, tied to the Fabians, tied to those British imperialists,

76:43
just so you're clear, they've killed three of our presidents, Lincoln, McKinley, and JFK. Don't forget

76:51
that. Do they not do they not try to kill Trump? Uh well, I believe that was a scops as well for the accountants in the

76:58
desert. They were trying to do everything possible to make sure he got in. Why?

77:04
Because they know where their bread is buttered. Absolutely know where their bread is buttered. And you have to

77:10
realize that the one last little bit that the credit that I give Trump

77:17
is people forget and I know this because I'm a New Yorker and I grew up in New

77:23
York. Trump was best friends with JFK Jr. and he always told JFK Jr. that if I

77:29
ever run for president, I'm going to make sure that I release and tell the world what happens. Guess what? his

77:35
first term, he finds out that his friends that got him into New York real estate are complicit in the murder. So,

77:43
he has to make a decision. And guess what? When the Zionists find out that Trump knows the truth from being the

77:49
president, what do you think they felt? Do do you think I think they felt the same way

77:55
about Trump as they felt about Gats? And what did they do?

78:00
I I'll leave that up to you to decide, but I will tell you the fact that Trump did release what he released. I still

78:08
think we need the Angleton report completely fully redacted because then you'll find out just how devastating the

78:14
story is. And then when you realize that the same people that killed Kennedy are the same people that took the towers

78:19
down in New York. We talked about the USS Liberty. We haven't talked about the 3,500 people that died that day at the

78:27
hand of your government. Okay, that's the Bush people. That goes all the way back again to the story I told you.

78:34
Prescott Bush is the greatgrandfather of George W. The father of George H.

78:40
Remember George H also ran the CIA. You You need to see where all these pieces

78:46
fit. It's like the tool song. Who did do 911 though? Everyone says the Jews did 911. The CIA did 911. The

78:51
same people that killed JFK. It's a It's a dual partnership. Remember the Accountants and Murder Inc. are together

78:57
now just like they were with Myer Lansky and Lucky Luchiano. No different. That's

79:03
the reason why you've heard me wax poet on so many other podcasts to talk about this because I believe young guys like

79:08
you if you don't know how this history was forged. There's no way for you to

79:14
understand and make predictions about what the next step is going to be. And I

79:20
can tell you the next step that I'm warning people about is that CO was a

79:25
compliance test for a coming economic reset. If you don't think that the next

79:30
18 months, the biggest wakeup call for people everywhere in the world is going to be when nobody's there to refinance

79:38
27 trillion worth of debt in the United States. What happens then? I promise

79:44
you, dude, there's going to be a lot of people both in El Salvador and America

79:49
who are going to be like those people in Thailand when the water goes out in the bay and they're going to be caught with

79:55
nothing. Okay? They're going to taper this Ponzi scheme. They try to do it

80:00
first with needles. Now they're going to they're they're stepping up the plan. And just so everybody's clear about

80:05
this, that plan was set in force by Cla Schwab, Henry Kissinger, and Prince

80:12
Charles in 1971 when the World Economic Forum was built.

80:18
You need to know who those architects are. Remember who Kissinger worked for? Nixon, who was part of what Eisenhower's

80:24
administration. Okay? Very, very tight with the people who also took out JFK,

80:32
which is the CIA. Why does he lose his presidency in 7374? Because he was getting ready to come out

80:39
just like Hail Bogs did who sat on the Warren Commission. Dude, you need to be

80:44
a diagnostician here. So when people tell you that I'm crazy like they did,

80:50
you can sit across from me. Why do I know all this? Why is it discoverable

80:55
for me but not for you? Why? Because I questioned what I was taught. Because

81:00
none of it made sense. And I did the heavy lifting for all the savages like

81:06
you. And why am I telling you about your future children that are being popped

81:11
with a jab that has its origins when Richard Nixon was the vice president.

81:18
The polio jabs that had SV40 in it. The same story is playing out right now.

81:23
They are coming for your future army. Do you know why they let queers and

81:28
transvestites and gay people and and sick people into

81:33
the military now? They don't want anybody to be a savage in there. They're not looking for anybody. Okay? They're

81:40
not they're not interested. They don't they want to be kept in

81:46
power. They don't need a strong military anymore. Why? Because DARPA is now using

81:52
electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to control you to control you

81:59
to use that computer that's sitting in front of you. It's the reason why we don't have earpieces. You're the first

82:05
podcaster I've actually done a podcast with that I don't think has wore a headset. So I I give you plus five for

82:11
that. I almost wore sunglasses on the on the show. So that's not cool. I'm totally messing with you. No, I was

82:18
I He told me about that. like he's like he he hates sunglasses. I'm like no I know but you know but but I but I I do

82:24
agree with you like you mentioned a little bit that the EMF that's what's going on with their testosterone levels like that to me there's no better sign

82:30
that it's not a conspiracy by just looking at the grip strength of men and the way that it's related to

82:36
testosterone and how like young men are you know they say it's you know from porn or whatever but it's like you got

82:41
young guys that are 17 with erectile dysfunction these days. You know, that's the hardest thing to do when you're a

82:46
17-year-old guy is not put your where you shouldn't be putting it. That's what you should want to be doing. You're like in this massive, you know, procreation

82:53
mode. And these guys are not interested in women anymore. They're not getting horny. And you're going, "Hey guys, this

82:58
is a problem. Young guys are not horny." But that's the big issue. But that's also tied to the story when

83:04
you understand how the pieces fit and how everything is is happening for the

83:10
reasons it's happening. Like we just talked off air, you know how Bobby's now championing the food thing that Callie's

83:15
champion, Froot Loops and Red Dye number seven. What people don't realize, why did Monsanto have to exist? They had to

83:21
create seeds that would germinate with EMF in the atmosphere. But what people

83:26
don't understand is the ionosphere that's above us. Remember, how do plants grow? This is you learn in third grade.

83:32
The sun, water, dirt, CO2 turns into sugar. Photosynthesis everybody knows.

83:39
What happens when you put a trillions of EMFs? Guess what? Your your land

83:45
eventually goes bad. You have to put potach in it. You have to put soils in it. You have to put all different types

83:51
of minerals. But you believe that it's because of industrial farming. That's what they want you to believe. That's

83:56
what Bobby wants you to believe. That's what big pharma wants you to believe. But it turns out it's DARPA. DARPA is

84:04
really behind why the soils are bad. It's the reason why we have to use fake food. Why? because they put atoms in

84:10
that fake food that you'll never know that they can use to program you. What do they do with drugs? The same thing.

84:16
But how are they not falling prey to that? Because have you not seen what Bill Gates does? He owns his own farmland. Do you think that he's got any

84:23
of the cows that have been injected by his Hell no. And what else is he doing? What's the whole thing that keeps

84:29
you healthy? How do you raise your testosterone back up? You have to have good sun. What? Let me ask you a

84:34
question. What is Bill Gates trying to block? Sunlight. Hm. Kind of interesting. How about every person that's listening to

84:40
this podcast, they go outside today and see if they got any chemtrails over

84:46
their head? You see any here? No, you just see big clouds. Well, you asked me,

84:51
Jack, why are you down here? Cuz we don't have that kind of problem yet.

84:57
Now, do I know that the globalists are coming here? Oh, yeah. They don't they don't like what they see going on with

85:04
El Salvador, specifically our young president who actually went to CPAC and

85:09
told everybody, you want to know the problem, I'm going to tell you the problem. Okay, that's also an

85:14
interesting story. I was involved in that story as well. I talked to V Kelly 5 days before he went up there and he

85:20
asked me, he goes, I don't know what I'm going to say. What should I talk about? I said, tell him the truth. You go back

85:27
and listen to that CPAC speech for 23 minutes. Oh, he let America know what the truth was. But did they like it? No,

85:35
they didn't. And the the key is your job as the new media is to get the truth in

85:42
front of patriots. It's okay. If they think you and I are crazy because, you know, here's the cool thing. They now

85:48
have AI. They now have fact checks that they can do themselves and see if anything that you and I have talked

85:54
about today is is hyperbolic, is not true. You see why I have a smile

86:00
on my face? All of a sudden, you may find out that you're part of my crazy tribe.

86:06
Well, it does it does feel like that and kind of a I guess not I I don't want to conclude because I there's obviously

86:12
endless stuff to discuss and to talk about. probably end up being back in El Salvador at some point to have another

86:18
discussion if you're okay with that. Um because there's a lot of questions that I have. But but well that's if the FBI doesn't put you

86:23
you may be the first arrested. Well, that that's what I was going to say is that is you know I wanted to to

86:28
ask you you know in conclusion is that

86:35
I don't know what to do. Okay. I don't know what I I don't know exactly what to do. I've taken steps. I've gotten my

86:41
testosterone back up. And that actually was one of the main things I worked on was getting my test levels up. And now that once they were up, I got something

86:47
that I didn't know existed. I had this insane desire to fight that that I never

86:53
felt before and this confidence that even though I don't know what to do, I need to do something. And that

86:59
So you're a savage now is what you're telling me. Yeah. It it awakens. And I like that. But guess what? The thing that's cool about it, when you do

87:05
it the right way and you don't do it through the the doctor's needle and you use the sun and you use nature and you

87:10
use grounding to do it, God or evolution, whoever you believe, has built in a feedback system so that

87:18
you won't go and shoot people up. You're not going to turn into a school shooter. But guess what? The people that use

87:24
testosterone from big pharma that don't have that feedback loop in them, you

87:29
have to worry about those people. And nature always builds a positive and

87:36
negative feedback loop in us. And I am glad that you were able to get your testosterone back. Just like I'm hoping

87:42
a lot of ladies out there that have PCOS listen to this and go, "Well, that's the female car. Does all this stuff work

87:49
like it does for guys for girls?" It does. Cuz we need them, too. Because guess what? We need you to have babies

87:56
that don't put those kids in school that aren't going to sign up for the 72 shots

88:01
that are going to harm those kids. We need those kids cuz we have a war that we have to fight. And that war may not

88:09
be kinetic. That war may not be acute lead toxicity. I have a funny feeling

88:14
that that war may be financial. And I think that war may be electromagnetic.

88:19
And I think that it's no longer, my friend, survival of the fittest. It's

88:25
now survival of the wisest. And if you want to know what I teach my tribe is

88:30
how to be smarter than everybody else. It's no different than that cliche that you heard about when you were growing

88:36
up, perfect place for you. Uh cuz you said you're on the Gold Coast. If you

88:41
see a great white shark next to you and your friend, all you have to make sure of is that you can swim faster than him.

88:47
I'm telling you the same thing when it comes to all the people that voted for Trump and for Camala. Just make sure you

88:54
can swim faster than them when the time comes. I agree. You know, and man, I

89:00
don't even feel like I'm on a podcast right now. I feel like I'm in a classroom and I I feel like I'm genuinely learning myself, you know,

89:06
putting together so much of of what I feel like I think I know, but every time I I come to a conclusion, I'm like, I I

89:12
kind of might be wrong again. But that's good, though, because you know what? you, that means you have the beginner mindset. And that's why I'm I'm

89:18
actually enjoying talking to you because when I talk to somebody and I know they have the beginner mindset, that means

89:23
you're not going to be afflicted by the Dunning Krueger effect. In other words, you're always going to question the

89:28
things that you believe. And if you want to know the truth, that's how you build the savage. That's first principal thinking. And you're exhibiting that

89:36
even right now. I just hope that in your future business when you do this, you do the same thing. Like my big beef with

89:42
podcasters is when you say something to them, you throw them a huge softball. Say, "Let's go after this." And they

89:48
back away. I mean, you saw that happen when I went on Danny Jones said, "No, we can't talk about the the Zionist."

89:54
Yeah. Because they want them. Well, the thing is is that we're not going for any big tech monetization. This is the this is the kind of weird part that that I

90:00
think people don't realize. You have to think through everything. If you're going to make tell the truth and you're funding you're going for the easiest

90:07
route which is through the big tech then you're already beholden to the system more than anyone probably is even in in

90:13
the political system to AP pack or anything because you're directly saying look I'm going to choose to not talk about certain things if it affects the

90:19
coin that's going to get deposited in my account right when this is done view for view right I want to maximize my

90:24
viewership so I don't think that the future of truthful podcasting is trying to get the biggest numbers I don't think it's trying to make the most money I

90:31
think it's trying You you just you just explained why I go on shows that are not like Rogan and not

90:38
like Tucker. Why? I I can't have these discussions with them. They don't want to talk about

90:43
real. They just want to talk about what they think is real. And that's the reason why what you're doing I'm going

90:50
to tell you you are the new first amendment. That's why I'm happy to talk to you.

90:57
When I see that, everybody who told you that I was crazy, I'm sitting here with

91:02
a smirk on my face because guess what? I'm seeing the new ink on the First

91:07
Amendment sitting right in front of me. So, guess what? I don't think we're losing. I think we're winning. And I

91:14
think we're going to continue to win. And I think we're not going to win the way Trump gets on TV and tells people

91:20
we're winning. We need to do it the way people 250 years ago went means we we've

91:28
got to do it rolling our sleeves up. It's not going to be pretty. We're going to have to be ugly at times. But we have

91:35
to realize America now is connected not by borders. It's connected the way

91:42
you're connecting people. That the savage is out there. We may have passports from the same country, but

91:48
that doesn't mean that we need to be in the same country. the same state or the same city. We can share these ideas, but

91:54
guess what? You have to be the one to build that platform. You have to be the one that can share it on things like X.

92:02
Share it on Rumble. Share it on Twitch. You know, stay away from the platforms that you know that are heavily going to

92:08
censor this. But trust me, just like I always tell people, if you do things

92:13
right, you're a tuning fork that vibrates. You don't All you have to do is keep doing what you're doing. And all of a

92:19
sudden, all the other tuning forks out there start to vibrate, too. So, you asked me, "How do you get to the low

92:25
dopamine, low melatonin, low tea, PCOS people by doing what you're doing right

92:30
here today with me? That's all you need to do." Appreciate it. Dr. Jack Cruz, honestly, this has been a privilege to

92:37
sit here with you and to to listen to the breadth of knowledge that you have. And I feel like this should be

92:43
encouraging because our audience is primarily young. We're like mo mostly 18 to 35. I used to be young.

92:49
Well, I know you're 30. I know it's your your birthday uh recently and I know you turned 36, so you just got out of the

92:54
group, right? It's not Yeah, it's a it's it's Yeah, you used to be 35. But no, but with this wisdom,

93:00
obviously, you know, you've written a lot. You do write. There's places that people can follow you that they can keep up with with what you have to say.

93:06
You're on a lot of podcasts. So, for people who are new to you, and I'm sure it's actually a lot of people because that's that's the whole reason I'm doing

93:12
this is a lot of young people are just getting you they watch Rogan. Yeah. And it's like Yeah. I mean, it's like a

93:17
Reddit level knowledge, you know? It's like we sit there and it's more more like mindless entertainment, right, than

93:22
it really is getting any truth. So, yeah, if people want to find you and follow you, how can they support you? How can they get your work? Where can

93:28
they read you? Yeah. I mean, the easiest thing is um Dr. Jack Cruz kru on every platform. Uh

93:36
I have a website also jackcruz.com that's got a form on it. The forum is predominantly about science, but you'll

93:42
find there's a lot of political threads. A lot of the things that we talked about here today is in a specific form called

93:48
Cruz Longevity Center where I talk about all the politics. Uh, but most of the decentralized medicine stuff, uh, stuff

93:54
that I have to protect myself from medical boards, that's on Patreon. So, it's patreon.comdrjack

94:01
Cruz. Uh, I got a book on Amazon and as you know, I've done podcasts. Like if

94:07
you put my name in a Google box, you'll get overwhelmed. Yeah, I I definitely know that. I'm

94:12
hoping people do see this one though because uh like I mentioned, you know, if you guys are young, especially if you're um it's like even it's so funny

94:18
even uh my intern, he's just turned 18. And um I told him, he's like, "Yeah, I've been watching you for years." Like

94:24
when he applied and I go, "Yeah, but then you would been what, like 14, 13?" And he goes, "Yeah." He goes, he goes,

94:30
"I I have been." And it's getting younger and younger where these guys are realizing, you know, when you look in the mirror and you realize, you know,

94:36
you're being told not to be misogynistic, sexist, and all these things, and everyone around you is depressed, has erectile dysfunctions,

94:41
becoming gay, no one wants to get married, no one can get married, that maybe maybe, just maybe, the system is not what what you want to fall into.

94:48
Maybe you got to figure out and start searching. So, I encourage you guys to please go look at the doctor's work.

94:53
please go deeper into it and realize what you're getting there is, you know,

94:59
50 years of wisdom, 50 years of experience. And so you can gather a lot

95:05
of that knowledge. And I just I think people don't don't understand the the necessity. And also tell your friends, you know, send the stuff to your

95:10
friends. If you're on a long car ride, play it in the car, do whatever you've got to do because, you know, you've got to wake people up somehow. And sometimes

95:16
it takes one conversation, one uh opportunity to actually begin to change uh you know the direction of someone's

95:22
life. So doctor, thank you so much for coming on, man. We're a little far away from the table, so I usually shake people's hand, but I appreciate you.

95:27
No problem. Appreciate it. Thank you.
