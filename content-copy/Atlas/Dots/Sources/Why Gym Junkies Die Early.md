## Summary

- It is culturally accepted that being muscular or working out in the gym regularly is healthy. Yet centenarians never match this archetype. In fact, it is not uncommon to hear of premature deaths in those who are highly active and/or have excessive muscle tissue.
    
- Building muscle increases mitochondrial biogenesis, effectively increasing the energy potential of the body.
    
- Using Picard and Murugan’s ‘Energy Resistance Principle’, we can deduce that an increase in energy potential without a requisite increase in energy flow necessarily raises the resistance in the bioenergetic system. This resistance, if excessive and/or long-term, is a fundamental cause of disease and premature death.
    
- Building mitochondrial colonies in environments that are not conducive to energetic flow, such as artificially lit gyms, may set up the conditions for ill health and disease as predicted by the energy resistance principle.

## Thread

Gym culture has exploded in the last several decades as we have become more and more detached from what true health is. In some sense, gym culture is a modern, shining example of the body's incredible adaptive and transformative capacity. However, we have collectively conflated muscularity and endurance with health — a dangerous misnomer that may not only be false, but _anti-useful_. Big muscles do not make you live longer. In fact, they may be promoting the exact opposite effect. **Building a larger mitochondrial colony while in an environment they cannot function causes excessive resistance in our bioenergetic circuit.**

Arnold. Even relatively early on in the bodybuilding movement this musculature drastically exceeds the limits of nature. Physiques like this do not correlate with better health outcomes or longer life, despite the cultural view that this is healthy.

## Lessons from Ancestors & Centenarians

Examining hunter-gatherer populations (and even post-agricultural populations yet to be industrialised), what becomes abundantly clear is that they were consistently very lean, mobile yet exceedingly strong. Their musculature was extremely efficient without having a common hypertrophic pattern many strive for today. The preferential use of isolated, lever-and-pulley-type movements builds musculature in a way that does _not_ reflect functional movements or match the biomechanics of the human body. Movements like deadlifts, bench press and squats can promote adaptations that wind up being functional only in the gym, and dysfunctional in the real world.

Hadza hunter-gatherers. Notice how lean they are. Functional strength does not require hypertrophied muscles, in fact, excessive muscle tissue would likely be counterproductive. Note that their musculature has been cultivated outside, not in a blue-lit gym.

Going further, there is a profound trend in centenarians that is difficult to ignore. Those who age in good health and live long lives _never_ exhibit the muscular type our modern Western culture idolises. Centenarians are typically very lean, yet maintain strength and bone density that allows them to be adequately mobile. Mobility is critical as it allows the body to engage in functional, dissipative activities that promote longevity.[1](https://ricciflow.substack.com/p/why-gym-junkies-die-early#footnote-1-165172439) Big muscles **do not** linearly correlate with strength, just look at [Anatoly](https://www.youtube.com/@vladimirfitness).

We are conditioned in some sense to believe that big muscles are associated with better health and longevity. This message is somewhat insidious as there is little literature to suggest that deadlifting is an optimal (or even viable) strategy for health promotion and longer life. In fact, premature mortality is a common trait in highly physically active and muscular individuals. This is largely due to the fact that muscles are almost always build indoors, in air conditioned rooms and under flickering visible-only lighting.

A standard gym setting. Building mitochondrial density in this type of environment while living a standard lifestyle can come with serious consequences.

Exercise can result in a host of beneficial biological effects. Not only can it promote strength, it initiates various biochemical cascades that increase cognitive function, improve sleep quality and enhance both immune responsiveness and functionality. It does this as a response to the stress that exercise places on the body. This _eustress_[2](https://ricciflow.substack.com/p/why-gym-junkies-die-early#footnote-2-165172439) is a vital aspect of the body's dissipative capacity. But when we build muscle, this comes with an increased mitochondrial density too. At the surface, this might seem like a good thing — something that is desired. Indeed, increased mitochondrial biogenesis _is_ an important benefit of movement and engaging in challenging physical tasks. So if gym junkies have massive colonies of mitochondria in their myocytes, why do they tend to succumb to modern illnesses and die early? _How could mitochondrial density be a maladaptive trait?_

## A Fundamental Approach

A recent publication from Martin Picard and Nirosha Murugan has put forward a framework for understanding bioenergetic flow[3](https://ricciflow.substack.com/p/why-gym-junkies-die-early#footnote-3-165172439). Their 'energy resistance principle' incorporates elements of Ohm's law and a principle from Harold Morowitz in order to understand how energy flow organises systems.

Without resistance, energy within the system dissipates incoherently and rapidly. Complex systems employ precise resistances in energetic pathways in order to cohere and channel the flow of the energy in order to organise.

Consider energy moving without constraints; with no structure(s) to channel the energy and place resistance on the flow in specific ways, we would expect to see maximum dissipation; an explosion. Resistance allows for coherent transformation and channeling of energy within a system.[4](https://ricciflow.substack.com/p/why-gym-junkies-die-early#footnote-4-165172439) Without it, energy dissipates incoherently without any opportunity for energy to be stored and cycled within the system. In Picard’s formulation, energy resistance (èR) is equal to the energy potential (EP) divided by the flow squared (_f²_).

Picard’s Energy Resistance Principle. This is modelled off Ohm’s law where resistance is equal to voltage divided by current. Notice the power law linked to energy flow, this indicates that flow has an exponential influence on energy resistance.

Building a large mitochondrial colony increases EP — more mitochondria, more energy potential. So what about flow? Flow refers to the journey of an electron to molecular oxygen at complex IV, cytochrome c oxidase. Mitochondrial dysfunction is essentially the diminished capacity to flow electrons through the respiratory proteins to generate proton gradients, metabolic water and carbon dioxide. Modern life is full of exposures that reduce _f²._ The primary factor that reduces energy flow is visible-only lighting.[5](https://ricciflow.substack.com/p/why-gym-junkies-die-early#footnote-5-165172439)

Most of the solar photons that reach us concentrate at about 0.75eV, which corresponds to wavelengths in the NIR. These photons are within the relatively narrow tissue transparency window of biological tissue, where they are able to propagate throughout the body with high efficiency. While on their ‘random walks’, these NIR photons impart energy to the outer electrons of biomolecules and/or free electrons present in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This additional ≈0.75eV energy facilitates more efficient energy flow[6](https://ricciflow.substack.com/p/why-gym-junkies-die-early#footnote-6-165172439), explaining the results seen by [Powner and Jeffrey](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jbio.202300521) in their 2024 paper.

Spectral irradiance plotted against photon energy (eV). Note that most of the irradiance from solar photons is concentrated at ≈0.75eV — these are in the NIR region. The red shading over the graph denotes the tissue transparency window. It is no coincidence that the majority of solar irradiance is concentrated at the precise range of the tissue transparency window. We evolved to be transparent in this range so we could use these ≈0.75eV photons to power metabolism. Courtesy of Bob Fosbury.

Gyms are completely devoid of this crucial aspect of solar radiation, without which, energy flow is perturbed and our [photometabolism](https://ricciflow.substack.com/p/do-humans-photosynthesise) breaks down. So what we see in those who exercise indoors is a double burden:

- **Increased mitochondrial biogenesis** (↑EP)
    
- **Perturbation of photometabolism** (↓_f²_)
    

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F368e91fe-29cf-4389-a939-988ab628f46f_1280x720.png)



If energy potential is raised (mitochondrial biogenesis) and flow is perturbed (artificial lighting etc.), resistance in the bioenergetic circuit increases. Over time, this can cause disease.

Using Picard’s model, we can deduce that this pattern generates an overall increase in biological energy resistance. Excessive resistance is a fundamental cause of modern, chronic disease, yet this is precisely the pattern that is being perpetuated by exercise (particularly hypertrophic) indoors. While one may look like they are healthy and thriving, they are home to a mass colony of mitochondria that are ailing. Their muscles are fundamentally shaping the bioenergetic circuit, promoting excessive resistance that could be alleviated by exercising outdoors, earthed, and away from the burdens of anthropogenic electromagnetic energy.

“Over time, éR generates the key hallmarks of human diseases either directly driven by impaired electron flow (reductive stress, oxidative stress, molecular damage) or indirectly by activating gene programs (pro-inflammatory states and cytokines, integrated stress response [ISR], and growth differentiation factor 15 [GDF15]). Thus, the biological origin of the hallmarks of disease can be traced back to excessive energy resistance.” — Picard and Murugan 2025.

## Bottom Line

All of this is to say that we have defendable, fundamental reasons to explain why those who are exercise addicts/gym junkies tend to die prematurely. Increasing energy potential through mitochondrial biogenesis while simultaneously living in an environment that reduces energy flow, _necessarily_ increases energy resistance. Excessive energy resistance is a fundamental cause of chronic disease and premature ageing/death. Thinking about it from this fundamental perspective can not only make sense of what we observe in the real world, but also provide guidance for building muscle _without_ increasing bioenergetic resistance.

Exercising should be outdoors, in natural environmental influences. Indoors, under artificial light, the stage is set to excessively increase energy resistance in the system; particularly when this is a repeated, long-term behaviour. I believe that this principle accurately predicts what we see with this subgroup within the population. Exercising regularly under the influence of signals that perturb the flow of electrons to molecular oxygen will increase energy resistance by definition. Increasing muscle mass, and thus mitochondrial density, increases EP. Without an accompanying increase in _f²_, increased muscle mass tends to raise èR. This fundamental shift over extended periods of time can undoubtably lead to chronic illness and ultimately premature death.

This is **not** to suggest that occasionally exercising indoors is _a priori_ ‘bad’ for health. However, what we see is a trend of those who over exercise and/or have excessing muscle mass are at risk of increasing their bioenergetic resistance such that health is compromised. The key here is to focus on optimising the flow of electrons through the mitochondrial respiratory complexes. This limits resistance, particularly where EP is also increased (increased muscle density). This boils down to the same pillars of health we must be familiar with regardless of health goals: sun, sleep, mindset, hydration, nutrition, connection, purpose.
