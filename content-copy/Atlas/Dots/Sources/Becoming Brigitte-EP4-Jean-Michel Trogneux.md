### Detailed Summary of the Episode

This episode of *Becoming Brigitte*, recorded on July 12, 2025, at 03:46 PM PDT (updated to 03:57 PM PDT per system note), marks Jean-Michel Trogneux’s birthday and serves as a pivotal installment in Candace Owens’ investigative series. Focusing on family charts, identity discrepancies, a groundbreaking 1977 interview, and a surrounding "syndicate," Owens deepens her conspiracy theory that Brigitte Macron may be Jean-Michel Trogneux. The episode blends factual timelines with speculative leaps, incorporates sponsorships, and engages the audience, positioning Owens as a crusader against media manipulation and elite secrecy. 
#### Introduction and Birthday Context

- **Celebration**: Owens opens with a birthday song for Jean-Michel Trogneux, equating it to Brigitte Macron’s, setting the tone for exploring his identity as key to her narrative.
- **Apology and Recap**: She apologizes for not showing a family chart last episode, despite audience requests, and promises to clarify the complex names in the Macron and Trogneux families. 
#### Family Charts and Discrepancies

- **Emmanuel Macron’s Family**: The chart lists Jean-Michel Macron and Françoise Noguès as parents, with [[Manette (Germaine Nogues)|Germaine]] "Manette" Noguès as a significant childhood figure. Owens revisits Françoise’s role in facilitating gender transitions, calling it a “bombshell” that allowed legal identity changes, and highlights her odd quote from *Just the Two of Us* (“Brigitte is not a daughter-in-law”), suggesting an alternative relationship. 
- **Brigitte Macron’s Family**: The chart includes André-Louis Auzière (husband for 32 years, three children: Laurence, Sébastien, Tiphaine) and Jean-Michel Trogneux (brother, best man at her 1974 wedding). Owens notes Brigitte’s pattern of date errors (e.g., Maryvonne’s death, niece Sylvie’s death) and Tiphaine’s mistaken 2019 burial claim, framing it as intentional confusion. 
- **Implications**: Owens questions the legal ramifications of identity changes, using a hypothetical (e.g., becoming Jean-Michel Trogneux) to argue defamation suits could hinge on erased identities, a theme tied to Françoise’s work. 
#### Jean-Michel Trogneux’s Timeline and Disappearance 

- **Early Life**: Born February 11, 1945, Jean-Michel attended a Jesuit Academy (photos exist), lived in Algiers in 1963 (unusual post-independence), and was best man at Brigitte’s 1974 wedding. - **Photographic Erasure**: Unlike Brigitte’s scant pre-professor photos, Jean-Michel’s trail ends post-1977, with schools (e.g., Sacré-Cœur) refusing yearbook releases despite legal requirements, suggesting a cover-up. 
- **Marriage and Child**: Married Véronique Dru in 1982, had son Jean-Jacques (resembling Emmanuel), and divorced in 1987, with no wedding photos, adding to the mystery. 
#### 1977 Véronique Interview and Voice Analysis 

- **Discovery**: A 1977 French talk show features "Véronique," a transitioning individual with a shadowed face, whose voice and “that is to say” tick match Brigitte’s. Owens plays the clip, noting its explosive impact. 
- **Transcript Highlights**: Véronique describes a feminine psyche pre-operation, legal identity struggles (mirroring Françoise’s work), and a job as a craftsman with public contact. She mentions living with a woman, alluding to George Sand and Frédéric Chopin, and cites gay poets Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud. 
- **Cultural Connections**: These figures tie to the Macrons—Chopin’s music in the Élysée, Macron’s push to honor Verlaine and Rimbaud in the Panthéon (rejected by Rimbaud’s family)—suggesting a shared identity narrative. 
- **AI Confirmation**: Xavier Poussard’s AI voice analysis (rated top by the World Economic Forum) confirms a 100% match, aging accounted for, though Owens expresses unease about AI’s future implications. 
#### André-Louis Auzière’s Mystery and Élysée Involvement 

- **Death Discrepancy**: Tiphaine’s 2019 *Paris Match* claim of André-Louis’s burial on December 24 (corrected to cremation on December 28) is revisited, with Jean-Louis Auzière’s account of an Élysée-orchestrated rushed funeral. 
- **Photo Destruction**: Only a swimsuit obituary photo remains, hinting at systematic erasure, with Jean-Louis noting Africa tickets and emptied accounts from André’s partner. 
- **Psychiatric Claim**: Sophie Des Déserts’ unsued 2022 report of André-Louis’s psychiatric stay under Alexandre Benalla adds intrigue. 
#### Alexandre Benalla and the Syndicate 
- **Background**: Benalla, Macron’s 25-year-old security head during the 2017 campaign, became deputy chief of staff, living in the Élysée. At 23, he was acquitted of violence against a woman. 
- **Banalla Affair (2018)**: Caught on video beating protesters as a fake police officer, Benalla retained diplomatic passports post-dismissal, meeting Chad’s Idriss Déby (later killed in a coup), and had financial ties to Russian oligarchs. 
- **Syndicate**: Owens lists a network—Benalla, Mimi Marchand (extortion, Best Image), Bernard Arnault (LVMH, *Paris Match*), Xavier Niel (intermediary), Nicolas Ghesquière (transgender promotion), and Françoise Noguès—alleging forgery, identity changes, and pedophile scandals surround the Macrons. 
- 
### Overall Narrative 

This episode pivots to Jean-Michel Trogneux as potentially Brigitte Macron, supported by the 1977 "Véronique" interview, voice analysis, and Jean-Jacques’ resemblance to Emmanuel. Françoise’s transition work, André-Louis’s erased past, and Benalla’s scandals suggest a groomed elite with a syndicate (Marchand, Arnault) controlling identities. Owens positions herself as a truth-seeker against gaslighting, leveraging Poussard’s AI and audience support, with her book and club amplifying the narrative.

00:00
happy birthday to you happy birthday to you 
yes you guys guess what today is Jean-Michel  

00:07
Trogneux's birthday in other words happy birthday 
Brigitte Macron the first lady Brigitte Macron so  

00:14
excited to get into this to bring to audiences 
who exactly is Jean-Michel Trogneux where he  

00:19
is we it's time to start that part of this 
series so welcome back to our series becoming

00:24
[Applause] [Music] Brit okay okay so some things to recap I was so 
frustrated at the end of the last episode because  

00:45
so many of you had commented canis it's time for 
you to create a family chart and we had already  

00:51
created a family chart I we just got so busy that 
I forgot to show it to you obviously on the show   so I completely dropped the ball there I apologize 
of course when we are doing these sorts of series  

01:00
like the Kamala series and now as we look at this 
Brit series it there's there are so many names   it does become confusing and it's good to slow it 
down and be able to visualize who and what exactly  

01:10
it is that we are talking about so let's kind of 
go backwards and start there I am showing you guys   now the Emanuel macron family chart okay the these 
are allegedly saying allegedly here because I have  

01:21
tons of questions as we get deeper into the story 
but his parents John Michelle macron uh then you  

01:27
have franois no um obviously we spoke a lot last 
week particularly about Germain no who he refers  

01:37
to affectionately as um manette right she's the 
one that shared this love of pedophile Centric  

01:45
books with her grandson she is as we mentioned 
to you last week the only family member that he  

01:51
includes in his childhood stories throughout his 
autobiography uh which is entitled uh Revolution  

02:00
so wanted to get over that wanted to speak about 
Revolution understanding that this is that is   actually the mccrone chart and then of course 
like I said his mother what we described yes on  

02:09
last week's episode or a couple of days ago the 
episode was that Dr Francis no his mother when  

02:15
she was first introduced to the world she was 
introduced as a pediatrician who helped out in  

02:21
some capacity the Social Security office and then 
we had this huge bombshell in the last episode  

02:26
where we learned just kidding by Social Security 
work we uh forgot to include the fact that she  

02:32
helps transgendered and interex people secure new 
identities I mean that was a major major major  

02:40
bit I mean that really it's explosive and 
it's important for you to remember that   as we go along because that means that macron's 
immediate family was involved in helping people  

02:51
okay who had gender issues to become someone else 
in other words they were facilitating the issuing  

02:58
of real government IDs which allowed people 
to legally shed themselves of their former  

03:05
identities and their true biological sex we have 
to wake up to the fact that that is the reality  

03:10
of the world that we live in today so what is that 
what are the implications of that let's just pause   there what are the implications of if I decide 
okay I'm Candace Owens nope I feel like actually  

03:21
I was born a man and so I'm going to change my 
name I'm going to change my name to Jean Michelle  

03:27
trno okay and then someone comes out and they 
say like you know Candace Owens is this person  

03:34
can I then sue them for defamation for saying that 
I'm Candace Owens if I've legally changed my name  

03:42
to Jean Michelle Chau that become the basis of a 
defamation Sho suit if you are able to shed your  

03:48
identity I want you to think about that as we keep 
going throughout this series it's very important   to remember this that his mother was dealing with 
this capacity in the Social Security office um I  

03:57
should also add here that thereafter shockingly 
in a very rare interview his mother gave to a  

04:04
journalist named Gail chaloff she was writing a 
biography about the macron couple biography was  

04:10
entitled just the two of us and she spoke with 
his mother and his mother said something very  

04:17
strange she said and I quote it's in this book 
for me Brit is not a daughter-in-law excuse me  

04:27
what does that mean Brit is married to your son 
she's been married to your son for a very long   time she fell in love with your son when your son 
was 14 years old what do you mean to me she is not  

04:35
a daughter-in-law what is the implication of that 
what else could she be what else could the first   lady be to you so we'll just leave that there okay 
now let's take a look at Bri macron's family chart  

04:46
okay we've got um some other important things 
to remember so you have brigit who allegedly  

04:52
was married for 32 years to this guy Andre Lewis 
oier okay and they allegedly had three children  

05:01
Lawrence oier Sebastian oier and Tian oier now 
it's important to remember which we touched upon  

05:08
last episode that the First Lady just routinely 
sort of gets things wrong in her interviews right  

05:15
like she gets the date wrong from when her sister 
Mary vau died she got the date very wrong from  

05:21
when her alleged niece died and we're starting to 
think of this is more of a strategy than anything  

05:26
else like it's not just forgetting dates it's 
because you're trying to confuse the public   and a big indication of that was tiffon okay her 
daughter getting both the date and the manner of  

05:38
her father's burial wrong in Paris match magazine 
Weekly Magazine how is that possible remember we  

05:45
talked about this we can bring up that chart again 
very weird mystery regarding this Andre Lewis oier  

05:52
character we how weird it was we cannot emphasize 
enough we learn from his first cousin okay he had  

05:59
a first cousin named John Lewis oer and that's 
where it got really confusing for some people  

06:05
there is a first cousin and that first cousin 
then described that essentially he had sued  

06:13
the journalist for misidentifying him in the 
wedding photo that first cousin then got upset  

06:20
because the El Palace kind of played him into 
suing her for defamation pretending they were   going to join the suit but then also brigit mcon 
refused to Simply say bring that picture back up  

06:31
yeah that's me that's me in the wedding photo 
she refused to do this and just kind of backed   out and so he wasn't happy with this the oers 
he was not happy he felt used by the L Palace  

06:40
he opens up to a journalist and tells us some 
really strange things about his cousin's burial  

06:45
about his cousin's funeral about his cousin's 
cremation mainly the strangest thing being that   the El Palace was involved okay they wanted to see 
to it that this funeral was executed like a thief  

06:56
in the night they did not want the public to learn 
about this and they were they saw it over the  

07:01
finish line and yet despite this bit macron did 
not attend the funeral of her alleged ex-husband  

07:10
of 32 years the alleged father of her children we 
want to make sure he's buried okay but we are not  

07:18
going to show up neither me or the president are 
going to show up and then tfon is going to just   make up what a massive mistake in Paris match 
and say I buried my father on December 24th  

07:28
and then we learned no he was actually cremated on 
December 28th and it was a year prior and this is  

07:33
the photo you use because everything everything 
was destroyed okay that's that's crazy so  

07:40
yes remember that we learned that information not 
from a conspiracy theorist we learned this from  

07:46
the cousin John Luis oier the cousin of Andre 
Okay the one who successfully sued Natasha Ray  

07:53
for defamation because she wrongly assumed that it 
was him okay what we do know and we confirmed last  

07:59
episode is that this man we can show you again 
his obituary photo because no other photos of   him exist from the wedding photo to this his whole 
life has been destroyed what we can tell you is  

08:09
that he did in fact exist they lied about where he 
worked what bank he worked at again tons of little  

08:15
lies to send people down rabbit holes so they can 
make a mistake but what we can't tell you is what  

08:21
exactly happened to him we cannot ascertain 
what happened to him based on the testimony   of his first cousin because it depends on whether 
or not you believe his partner the woman who was  

08:31
at his funeral who claimed that she found tickets 
to Africa in his pocket that he had emptied all  

08:37
of his bank accounts and if you potentially 
or you could say and or if you believe the  

08:44
journalist from Paris match who then wrote that 
Andre actually spent the last days of his life  

08:51
in a psychiatric W being guarded by none other 
than Alexander banala now we got to talk about  

08:59
this guy okay because he's important he's very 
important because he's come up actually a couple  

09:05
of times but we should dig into deep of why that 
that particular allegation matters because it's   interesting that despite the fact that they 
love to sue people they love to sue people they  

09:16
never went after that journalist who claimed that 
Alexander banala the former deputy chief of staff  

09:23
to Emanuel macron was guarding for whatever reason 
guarding a psychiatric ward door of Andre so we  

09:33
know for a fact that El Palace was involved at 
the very least in his funeral and this journalist  

09:40
put that so I think we should explore that so we 
should talk about Alexander banala because that   is not a subtle mention from a journalist okay 
we had first mentioned Alexander banala in the  

09:49
introductory episode when we told you about sort 
of this I don't know how to describe it like um  

09:56
a Syndicate almost of pedophiles that's these 
accidental pedophiles that Emanuel macron keeps  

10:01
Landing himself around okay we mentioned Olivier 
DL uh that was the man who was accused by his  

10:10
stepdaughter of having molested her twin brother 
when he was 13 or 14 years old she wrote this  

10:16
in a book and by the way because the statue of 
limitations had passed he was never brought to  

10:21
justice but he admitted that it was true that 
he did in fact sexually abuse his teenage son  

10:27
well one of the things that he helped because he 
was so close with Emanuel Marron with he helped   him um when he landed himself in hot water over 
what what has come to be known in France as the  

10:38
banala affair meaning Alex Ander Bala the Deputy 
Chief of Staff okay and now for whatever reason um  

10:46
like I said we have no idea why this journalist 
mentioned but said Alexander Bala was guarding  

10:53
the psychiatric word so I'm going to show you 
Alexander banala again that you can get him   into your mind despite being extremely young 
I want to be clear he is today only 33 years  

11:03
old he's got quite a remarkable professional 
resume okay when Eman mcon was running running  

11:10
for president Alexander banala was just 25 years 
old and he served the candidate as his security  

11:19
officer he was the head of his security okay 
once Emanuel macron got elected he then made  

11:24
Alexander banala his Deputy Chief of Staff okay 
huge position could you imagine 25 years old and  

11:30
you're like going into the White House y Palace 
it was then later discovered that these two had  

11:36
an incredibly close relationship so close Emanuel 
took him on a ski trip with him and his family not  

11:43
as the security like as like you're a part of 
the family on a ski trip and even closer than  

11:48
that Emanuel macron allowed Alexander banala 
this 25 26 year old kid essentially to move  

11:57
into the National Palace of the French Republic 
okay he was living at the palace of the alma that  

12:05
is shocking he had residency here okay so what's 
going on here just imagine your 26 you're living  

12:10
in a palace and I don't know I'm thinking he 
must have provided some incredible security  

12:16
to the president he must have done the president 
some solids okay when you dig into his past you  

12:21
learn that uh back when bonala was 23 years old he 
had been accused and then subsequently acquitted  

12:29
of violence against a woman okay in so far that 
she said that she was rendered incapacitated to  

12:34
work but as I said he was acquitted and then he 
became the head of Emanuel marron's security team  

12:40
then when man mome was President a massive Scandal 
broke which come came to be known obviously as the  

12:46
banala affair in 2018 when his Deputy Chief of 
Staff was actually caught on camera dressed as a  

12:55
police officer beating protesters in the street of 
Paris I'm not kidding okay L man I told you that's  

13:02
like the French New York Times broke the story 
they had footage of him it was undoubtedly banala  

13:09
imperson a police officer and beating a young 
protester in the streets and then a second video  

13:17
emerged which was published onto Twitter which 
showed bonala grabbing a female protester by the   neck and dragging her away actually I'm going to 
ask my producer Skyler were we able to pull that

13:26
footage okay great let's actually show you 
um some of that footage this this is just  

13:33
to make you guys understand this what you 
are looking at is a chief of staff of a  

13:39
president beating up a protester he's going 
to come on in there in police uniform that's

13:46
[Applause] him look at [Applause] [Music]

13:51
this just totally normal Chief of Staff stuff 
right that's just what everybody's chief of staff  

14:05
is doing all around the world um it would later be 
discovered Ed that as people began investigating  

14:11
the story more and more that three police officers 
provided him with more surveillance footage  

14:18
Alexander Bala they were giving him surveillance 
footage that had not yet been made available   to the public essentially allowing for him to 
prepare his defense which signals to us that okay  

14:29
they've got ties with the police officers clearly 
otherwise he wouldn't have been given the uniform  

14:35
to wear as he pretended to be a police officer 
that day now president macron at the time of this  

14:41
attack was in Australia he seemed incredibly 
reluctant to let go of his Deputy Chief or to  

14:46
speak about the matter in any capacity publicly 
essentially which is why I guess he called up his   dual friend what should I do what do you mean what 
should you do your chief of staff was just caught  

14:55
beating protesters in the street why aren't you 
just more shocked at that what do you mean what   do you do uh and it seems that Emanuel MCR might 
have been so concerned about this that he tried  

15:07
to help Alexander out now why am I making that 
assumption again this is an assumption not a   fact but it what is a fact is that Alexander Bala 
when he was being interviewed about the Scandal  

15:17
no none other than Mimi marand was in the room to 
assist him speaking to the Press Mimi marand yes  

15:27
uh the Pope the celebrity popess of the press who 
could get anything in the press anything taken out  

15:33
of the press woman that could get the press to 
cover up pedophilia charges for her friends okay  

15:40
eventually as the Scandal completely engulfed the 
El Palace they did in fact have to move to dismiss  

15:46
bonala on paper at least I want to be clear on 
paper he was released because then another Scandal  

15:51
emerged it would later be discovered that a few 
months later they realized they did not actually  

15:57
remove his diplomatic passports and despite 
being seemingly fired several months later he  

16:02
used those diplomatic passports to travel to meet 
with African leaders including the president of  

16:09
Chad a guy named Idris Deb now for people that 
are watching this from Africa you're looking at  

16:16
this guy going didn't he die a few years later 
in kind of one of those stereotypical Western   scenarios where suddenly a group of rebels Rises 
up give me like a moo marafi type situation and  

16:26
the rebels are just so unhappy and they kill the 
president yeah that's what happened to that guy   in Chad yeah so but I'm sure it was totally 
organic and people were really unhappy in the  

16:35
streets and like the West had nothing to do with 
it nonetheless Alexander Bala was meeting with   this guy on diplomatic passports after he had been 
fired so it was a second part of the Scandal it  

16:46
then emerged that while he was working for macron 
Alexander Bala this 26-year-old Palace living King  

16:54
had actually contracted Financial ties with two 
Russian oligarchs who were said to be members of  

17:00
the Russian mafia oopsies again I guess everyone 
around me is accused of being either a criminal a  

17:07
pedophile so what I'm sh Min grown is always just 
so innocent in this pit it just keeps happening to  

17:14
them they're trying to work with good people guys 
they're really trying to surround themselves with   good people I swear it's everyone around them it's 
just not them I think that we should actually take  

17:24
a look here at this extraordinary Syndicate that 
is emerging around them because we've covered a  

17:29
lot of these people so Michelle Maron obviously 
the pop s up there on the left right of the French  

17:35
media we know she's been inded in in dirt she's 
been kicked out for y extortion you name it she's  

17:41
been accused of it a woman that we understand had 
the capacity the only person that people had to go  

17:47
through to get photos of the first lady's past 
she owns best image okay and you're telling me  

17:53
this is the only person that can produce images 
from bit mcc's past before uh she became a a  

17:59
professor or a teacher uh seems a little suspect 
uh then below her we have Bernard Arno richest  

18:06
man in the world because he controls LV MH um we 
mentioned his son-in-law Xavier Neil who was the  

18:14
in between the go between between Mimi marshan 
and the first couple but I want you to also know  

18:20
that lvmh owns Paris match okay so that's where 
she's putting all of these doctored airbrushed  

18:27
images I would say airbrushed images of brigit so 
that everyone thinks she's like young and looking  

18:33
and irresistibly hot she's working on that then 
we'll jump up to the right corner there we mention  

18:39
Nicholas gascar is the person that's dressing the 
first lady also under the lvmh Empire the one who  

18:45
is just putting transgendered people everywhere 
he can honestly you should just Google Nicholas   gasier in your in your spare time because we 
didn't even scratch the surface in terms of how  

18:54
dedicated he is to the trans cause and bringing 
all these trans models and putting them on the   runway and trying to trans trans trans everything 
but I'm sure brigit mcon is exactly who he says he  

19:04
is um and just I don't know just wants to dress 
briet mcon for whatever reason it is what it is   is then of course as we mentioned um Emanuel 
macron's mother Fran no who we know is concerning  

19:15
her work to trying to get individuals who suffer 
from identity issues new identities and doing this  

19:24
by the way this is legal this is legal now okay 
and then we have there on the bottom who we just  

19:29
discussed was Alexander vanala so just just piece 
all that together okay with forgery extortion and  

19:37
most importantly with access to a woman who can 
facilitate the changing of identities it is not  

19:44
enough for any person investigating this case 
to ask questions like is this brigit trau in  

19:51
the wedding photo you will notice we didn't 
ask that question when when my legal team   got involved we didn't say is this brigit trno in 
the wedding photo we had to instead ask something  

20:00
more specific is this the current first lady 
of France brigit macron pictured here in this  

20:10
wedding photo okay and that's when the couple 
gets real quiet they don't want to answer those   questions do you guys get what what I'm getting 
at here okay because we can confirm that that is  

20:21
indeed a photo of a woman named Brit trogo in that 
wedding photo where that Brit is we cannot confirm  

20:30
because the first lady refuses to answer she has 
a mother-in-law who helps transgendered people   get new identities so you have to essentially 
understand that you can just take somebody's  

20:42
name you can take you can become somebody else 
at a moment's notice now legally when you become  

20:49
transgendered okay this brings us to Jean Michelle 
trogo okay we we obviously have to discuss him  

20:57
this is Brit trag no's brother today is his 
birthday happy birthday John Michelle trno it's  

21:03
really important that we learn about him a guy who 
was so close to his sister two different people  

21:09
his sister bit trau that she made him the 
best man at her wedding but then he just was  

21:16
completely missing from mention when the first 
lady Brit Marron came into Power seemed to be  

21:24
purposeful to allow this person to fall through 
the cracks despite all of the stuff being written   about her family and where she came from there 
was no mention of Jean Michelle trau that was  

21:33
the dog that was not barking we're going to talk 
about him we're going to allow that dog to bark

23:49
let's speak about John Michelle drug no this has 
been trending in France this has been explosive  

23:55
everybody knows something's going on here but the 
English speaking world did not understand what  

24:00
was happening and there are a lot of questions 
even in the French speaking World they don't   understand why it is that Xavier pussard has 
not been sued for defamation but matasha Ray has  

24:09
what is the difference um Xavier busard was always 
very clear with me that his major breakthrough  

24:14
came thanks to the work of Natasha Ray she came to 
him and first said like this is John Melle trog no   I've been working on this so where did she fumble 
the ball and where did he not fumble the ball and  

24:24
this is where it gets really interesting and 
it is why it was so important for me to slow   that down for you that we are talking about two 
different individuals um Jean-Michel Trogneux and  

24:34
his sister brigit trno what you should know about 
Jean-Michel Trogneux was that he was born born on  

24:39
February 11th 1945 and regarding his existence 
there can be no question in fact it is a stark  

24:46
contrast to trying to look into Brit trno unlike 
his sister Brit trno who like her husband appears  

24:54
to have nearly every trace of her existence 
magically wiped destroyed you cannot get your  

25:00
hands on documents in fact bjit trno person who's 
claiming to be in the El Palace as Brit marro  

25:09
you think it'd be very easy to get school pictures 
of her you can't get them Xavier pussard has gone  

25:16
through Court processes in order to get his hands 
on a yearbook that should be supplied by law okay  

25:25
she went to S Sacred Heart sakur qua I hope I'm 
saying that okay in French Saka qua and they're  

25:31
supposed to give you the yearbook so you can 
look at a picture despite this the school is   refusing to do that now why would a school refuse 
to give you a photo of the first lady of the first  

25:43
lady growing up why can't we see pictures of the 
first lady in yearbooks that are in existence why  

25:49
can't we see her in elementary school in Middle 
School in high school why why is that why is it   that every trace of brijit TR NOS existence is 
impossible to Garner and it was also difficult  

25:59
but not impossible to Garner um stuff about 
John Michelle trno and we were able to piece  

26:05
together a very clear timeline of his existence 
until he kind of magically falls off of a cliff  

26:11
so we will walk you through this timeline okay 
John Melle told you born in 1945 we then know  

26:19
that he begins attending a Jesuit Academy we have 
multiple photos of him um at a Jesuit Academy and  

26:27
and I'm going to show you one of them I believe 
that we have here um yep so if you look there  

26:32
on the far right bottom you will see that that is 
John Michelle trno Okay and like I said I'm going  

26:39
to save some of the photos that we have because 
Xavier pussard is going to be our next episode   that interview and what he worked to get his hands 
on is explosive and I do not want to ruin that for  

26:48
him jumping back into our timeline uh in 1953 his 
little sister Brigitte Trogneux was born um then  

26:56
we know like I said that he continued to attend 
that Jesuit Academy then we have that famous  

27:03
1944 family picture which best image released 
to the documentary maker who felt like she was  

27:09
for whatever reason being uh questioned by the El 
pilot that were be treating her like they like she  

27:15
was under interrogation she was able to get her 
hands on that family picture 1955 to 1956 he's  

27:24
back at school again we will have those class 
photos available for you in Xavier's interview   in our sitdown which we will be releasing next in 
1960 uh Brit and John Michelle trag's Sister Mary  

27:36
Von trno dies in a car accident with her husband 
hband Paul farsy on February 24th their daughter  

27:42
Natalie 5 months old at the time survives and goes 
on to marry a guy named Richard and they have two   daughters in 1963 uh the public is then given 
a photo of what we are told is the real brijit  

27:55
trogo um at Communion we note that this does not 
look like the current first lady and the current  

28:00
first lady has thus far to this day declined to 
answer my question about whether or not not if  

28:06
it's brijit trno in the photo but whether or not 
it's her in the photo important differentiation  

28:12
in 1963 Jean Michelle trno lived in algers algers 
Algeria in February so he was 18 years old this is  

28:21
a highly unusual thing as Xavier told me because 
this was just after the bloody war of independence  

28:28
Algeria getting their their independence from 
France and he says at this time no Frenchman  

28:34
went to Algeria unless they were Communists but 
we know that he was there because there was a   available and we are Keen suddenly to get a photo 
of him around this time because well now we're  

28:46
not talking about kid photos which seems to be 
the only thing brigit mome wants to release um  

28:52
a very small amount a total of what three photos 
that were released doesn't want to release any   older photos until suddenly uh brijit Marron 
is a professor right briet oier says oh I'm a  

29:03
professor we're just kind of like missing these 
important years of her life which would allow us   to see the face sort of mutate over time right 
this next photo which I'm not going to show you  

29:14
because it is explosive and it took Xavier pussard 
years to get he gets his hands on a photo of Jean  

29:22
Michelle trogo who is enrolled in the estb TP 
School uh which is a French engineering school  

29:30
that becomes the last verified photo that we have 
on record but I want you to note he is 18 at this  

29:37
time you take any person you take a photo of them 
when they're 18 and it is very hard to say that  

29:43
you were expecting this person to look majorly 
different right um decades on from that because  

29:49
you are a a young adult right jumping back into 
this timeline we then know that the real brijit  

29:57
trno marries Andre Lewis oier becoming brigit 
oier we have a wedding announcement we have a  

30:04
wedding photo it actually happened and that is the 
photo uh which Natasha Ray made an unfortunate and  

30:10
totally understandable mistake regarding and then 
like I told you for whatever reason John Michelle  

30:17
photographically disappears he disappears and 
then this amazing thing happens in 1977 when  

30:26
people started recognizing that their first 
lady something about the story didn't make   sense when people began first speaking about 
their suspicions that they were looking at a  

30:35
transitioned man um for many reasons they 
were able to dig up an interview okay from

30:43
1977 and it's a man who says that he is 
transitioned and living as a woman named  

30:54
veronique now for my English listeners this is 
going to be um a bit confusing for you so I'm  

31:01
going to describe to you why this was so explosive 
every person that speaks you can transition your  

31:07
name you can try to speak in a different tone but 
you have ticks you know almost things that you say  

31:14
that you don't even recognize that you say words 
that you might rely on and for first lady macron  

31:20
that tick so to speak is she says that is to say 
right that is to say some people might say like  

31:30
you know like I was going to like the store and 
like her tick is that is to say that is to say so  

31:37
we have this individual who appears does not show 
their face it's shadowed on this talk show in 1977  

31:44
says their name is veronique and says that they 
have transitioned and the person has the exact  

31:50
same voice as the current first lady of France 
and the same tick and of course at the time that  

31:59
the first lady was doing all these interviews she 
never thought the public was going to dig up this   old interview of this transgendered individual 
on a talk show saying that that is to say that  

32:09
is to say over and over again so I'm going to 
play a little bit of this interview of course   it is in French so this will mean nothing 
to English listeners but then I'm going to  

32:18
read you the transcript because there's some other 
important coincidences that happened take a listen

33:05
now essentially someone in the chat here just 
said that's her voice but also someone who said  

33:12
in the chat that this you could refer to this 
as a a voice footprint that's a perfect way to   say it's a voice footprint there are things that 
you just can't rinse yourself of but also even  

33:22
when you transform your identity you still have 
an identity you still have interests that don't  

33:27
magically go away if you change your name okay 
this is why I'm going to tell you what she says in   the script if I'm Candice Owens even if I change 
my name to Jean Michelle TR no doesn't transform  

33:38
my interest it doesn't make me I love Italian 
food I'm not going to suddenly like not like   Italian food because I become Jean Michelle trog 
no I'm not going to suddenly not be interested in  

33:48
the Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds case because 
I changed my name legally to John Michelle trogo   and so this interview was explosive when it was 
released because of things that veronique said  

33:57
so I'm going to pull up the transcript for you in 
English and read you what this is translating into  

34:03
so the interviewer asks uh he says to the audience 
I can only guarantee the this the authenticity of  

34:09
veronique's testimony veronique I'd like to know 
if when you had this operation which is the one   you've had it was a difficult moment for you or 
was it just the culmination of something that  

34:19
had happened before barique says I don't think 
there's any transformation because the psyche is   already feminine and the individual in this case 
me is already prepared for this kind of M mutation  

34:29
out of necessity in the sense that we feel like 
women and we merely normalize a situation there's  

34:35
no transfer there's normalization interviewer 
says so you're completely a woman how long ago  

34:42
did you have the operation interestingly enough 
um she doesn't answer that part of the question   of when she had an operation but she goes on 
and she says answers I don't really like the  

34:52
words completely a woman in other words we 
become a kind of woman who can copulate but  

34:58
cannot procreate hence the legal problems we'll 
be talking about later in other words integration  

35:03
goes smoothly on an individual level they only 
exist on a social level okay so already she's  

35:11
starting to speak about this trouble that we know 
that Emanuel maron's mother is going to concern  

35:16
Herff with which is like okay there are these 
legal problems with who we identify with and who   we we we know we're women okay but we have these 
legal hoops and barriers and this is why I'm I'm  

35:27
breaking and telling my story because we have to 
change this we have to be able to change this the   univie says you have a job that we're not going to 
reveal here let's just say it's a job that's about  

35:36
the public there are responds that's right I'm a 
Craftsman I have regular contact with the public  

35:42
I'm in close contact with customers I don't have 
any problems I used to because I had a phenotypic  

35:47
gender meaning an ambiguous appearance they took 
me for what I wasn't uh a homosexual which wasn't  

35:54
the case either in my behavior or in my way of 
thinking but unfortunately this image resulted  

36:00
in non-integration um uh this is partially 
cut off here for me but it says uh non- integr

36:08
a and actually and actually I normalized a 
situation for my integration and I live very  

36:19
legally and honorably for civil status purposes 
it is possible to change your first name to an  

36:26
ambiguous one this is very important because 
it enables integration or pseudo integration  

36:32
into society in the sense that there are always 
problems but they can be solved administratively  

36:37
by mut ual agreement but legally there's no 
solution unlike All Foreign legislation except  

36:43
the Belgian legislation which is modeled on ours 
the interviewer then ask do you feel that you   are now completely yourself and you don't have any 
problems identifying yourself since your operation  

36:53
veronique says to tell the truth I only had 
identification problems towards others not with   myself I saw myself as what I was a woman with a 
body that didn't belong to her it's very difficult  

37:03
to conceive for someone who's comfortable in one's 
own skin I use the term comfortable in one own   skin because it's the typical image because 
I didn't have any problems but people created  

37:13
problems now I don't have any problems to tell 
the truth this operation um that is the removal  

37:19
of this useless organ in our case because it is 
both unusable and unused and the interviewer asks  

37:25
her do you live alone veronique says I'm not 
with anyone but I've lived with a woman and  

37:32
conceived this Union in the style of George sand 
and chopan chopan was probably a transsexual his  

37:41
style of Melody the way he plays makes this quite 
clear I think the image that has been given of  

37:46
the rimod verlon Union is a distorted caricatured 
image that doesn't correspond at all this is very  

37:55
important okay she has this speech tick it's 
exactly like bri macron's if you spoke French   you would understand that but she also mentioned 
musical composer Frederick chopan plus mentioned  

38:06
gay poets Paul Lan and Arthur rimod now why is 
that significant okay well these poets they were  

38:12
in a homosexual Affair um you know but violent 
very violent relationship so she's clearly coming  

38:19
across as someone who is tremendously educated 
this is not some random person right this is   somebody who has been educated in the classics who 
is on this show for the purpose of trying to move  

38:30
along legislation to be able to make it easier 
for people who are trans to secure identities  

38:35
that is the purpose of this appearance right 
and as I said the purpose of using someone who   has sort of this ability to communicate and speak 
about the high Arts is to make people perhaps the  

38:45
audience is more sympathetic with the Cause right 
she's saying I was always a woman which is funny   because as I read that I also what's ringing 
in my head is that sentence that brigit and  

38:57
Emanuel wrote to me in the first legal letter they 
said she does not owe you any proof that she has  

39:03
and always will be a woman like very strange very 
strange thing to write like almost like I believe  

39:10
it and therefore it is and of course you do owe 
me proof you're going to say that you're going to   sue me in a Tennessee Court you absolutely will 
be owing me proof If you're going to say that I  

39:17
defamed you but going going back to the mention 
these these classical mentions regarding chopan  

39:24
the first couple when they were creating their 
legend in the public claimed that they had moved  

39:30
a piano into the LA palace because Emanuel macron 
remember the virtuoso loved to play chopan for  

39:38
bit and for brigit only so this is something 
this matters to the couple okay regarding the  

39:43
homosexual poets that she mentioned uh Paul verain 
and rimod Emanuel macron while acting as president  

39:51
considered admitting them both into the pantheon 
the the which is it's where they bury all of these  

39:59
French Heroes okay and this sparked a massive 
debate like should these people first off one  

40:06
of the lovers shot the other one had to serve time 
in prison would this be a good thing to move them   he was going to honor them as this like homosexual 
these homosexual poets and greats by burying them  

40:17
in this significant structure but what ended up 
happening was Rod's family firmly rejected that  

40:25
um honor because they did not want his legacy to 
be reduced to a gay icon so that's just incredibly  

40:32
fascinating right it's incredibly fascinating 
that you have this person veronique and she's  

40:38
saying and mentioning all the people that we 
know have this significance in the relationship   between Emanuel macron and Brit and she has after 
somebody used an AI voice analysis they said that  

40:50
this was 100% the same person and you know I don't 
know much about these softwares but for somebody  

40:56
to come out and to declare that this is 100% the 
same person and the only difference is that the   The Voice has aged to have the same ticks it's 
a lot of coincidences it was it was Major when  

41:06
this happened and when this was revealed and then 
there are some more interesting things to remember  

41:12
here okay when you jump back into the timeline 
so veronique appears we don't know what what  

41:19
this person's name is in life they're using this 
name for this interview veronique no last name we  

41:24
don't know anything else but don't forget that 
this person also said that he's not in a real  

41:29
relationship but he lives with a woman okay barque 
says he lives with a woman well when we jump back  

41:37
into to our Jean Michelle trno timeline we find 
that at this time Jean Michelle trau following  

41:45
this interview marries a woman and ironically her 
name is veronique so could it be possible that  

41:55
John Michelle took on the name of a dear friend 
named vinique who he was living with and who he  

42:02
then moved to Mary we don't know because of course 
there are no pictures of this wedding there's   nothing there's nothing there John Michelle trno 
on paper gets married to a woman named veronique  

42:13
Drew okay and then they have a child they have 
a child in 1982 named John Jack that's the John  

42:22
Jack that looks tremendously like Emanuel Marron 
and then shortly thereafter in 1987 John Michelle  

42:30
divorces veronique Drew so ladies and gentlemen 
what is going on on serious like just like what  

42:39
is going on in this story what is happening 
how do we have these actors who are unable to  

42:47
produce images from these very relevant things 
that happened in their lives you know where is  

42:53
John Michelle drag no you got married to a woman 
are there no pictures from your wedding day no  

42:59
you just dis and you decided to just fall off 
a cliff and stop being photographed at the same   moment that Brit mcon the Professor the teacher 
was born suddenly like no more photographs for  

43:12
you what what is going on here why have why do 
we have a situation in which schools which are  

43:19
legally required to release photos I believe 
the the law in France is after 50 years any  

43:26
person can get any photo of somebody that is in 
school right you can release the earbook photos   why are they refusing to release photos of who 
was supposed to be the first lady in elementary  

43:38
school and in middle school and in college why why 
can't we get these photos why are people having to  

43:44
go through court and be GID to get these photos if 
it's really you brigit mccrone and you didn't take  

43:51
on the identity of your sister if it's really you 
why are you struggling to answer basic questions  

43:59
forget the conspiracies why are you refusing to 
answer basic questions while trying to push people  

44:07
to sue for defamation waiting for people to make 
mistakes why not just clarify are you the same  

44:14
person pictured in this wedding photo are you 
brijit trno how much more basic of a question  

44:21
could I have asked you whether than did you Brit 
Marron give physical birth to three children okay  

44:30
do not allow people the media to Gaslight you into 
thinking that you are asking of something that is  

44:36
just such an invasion of priv y it is completely 
nutty okay it we are Beyond lunacy when we are  

44:43
talking about such basic questions that could 
have put this all to bed a long time ago and we  

44:49
are like eight years in to them instead preferring 
to legally try to punk people to scare people to  

44:57
intimidate people sending out thugs potentially 
okay and when we look at that nebula when we  

45:03
look at the surrounding and The Supporting 
Cast of Emanuel macron and bit Maron do you  

45:09
feel comfortable with what's going on here is it 
every day that you need to have someone who forges   documents around you allegedly Mimi marshand she's 
still facing trial right now someone who's been  

45:20
involved extensively in extortion who's facing 
trial right now for extortion is it normal to   just keep having these sort of gang type members 
around you people that can control images that  

45:29
can edit images and put it in the Press like 
are are are we going to accept as the p as the   public that this is completely normal that they 
just keep Landing into these pedophile scandals  

45:41
or are we going to recognize that something very 
Sinister is going on that Emanuel mcon and briet  

45:47
mcon are not presenting themselves as who they 
say they are as what they say they are I believe  

45:52
they were groomed for this position I believe 
especially Emanuel macron without question was   groomed by bit there's no question about that 
the only question that remains is who the hell  

46:01
is briet mccrone and the obvious answer to me and 
after you see these photos that you are going to  

46:08
see one in particular um from when John Michelle 
trno was 18 you're going to fall down like I did  

46:13
when I saw it it's just it's completely crazy it's 
completely crazy and thankfully for the work of  

46:19
Xavier pussard the one thing that helped him not 
make mistakes was that he was using an AI program  

46:28
which the world economic Forum has rated the 
number one facial detection software which allowed  

46:34
it allowed him to avoid making mistakes it's the 
same program is used by China right obviously you  

46:40
know they have in China the social credit system 
and everyone's face they have to be able to tell  

46:46
apart right very similar faces they have to be 
able to tell apart and this was ranked as the   number one software to be able to do that and so 
when he thought something he ran the software like  

46:57
with the wedding photo he ran the software and he 
said I know this guy looks like this guy but the  

47:02
percentage on this software is saying that the 
cousin and the man are two different people so   he didn't run with that theory he didn't go just 
based off of his gut instinct he also was being  

47:12
aided by a software which was giving him answers 
before he even really knew what the answers were  

47:17
we'll have more on that when I sit down with him 
uh but do know that the software he is using has   the blessing of the world economic forum and I 
think we've all figured out that that forum is  

47:27
pretty evil and they want us all to be able to be 
identified and the software I had to tested out  

47:34
myself to believe in it it's incredible I mean you 
can take a woman when she's 6 years old she could   have had 20 surgeries in her face to transform 
her face and it will still go that's her 80%  

47:45
chance I've never seen anything like it it kind 
of terrifies me about our future it terrifies me   about AI in general but for the purposes of his 
investigation um it really allowed him to sort  

47:55
things and he there's no question uh upon seeing 
this technology uh in my mind that Jean-Michel  

48:01
Trogneux is Brigitte Macron the only question 
that I have is what happened to his sister  

48:07
trog now and you'll get to that as well like I 
said I didn't want to give us too many spoilers  

48:13
ahead of the interview I sit down with him but um 
there's just more there is there's so much more  

48:20
for us to unpack the Rothchild connection the jobs 
that he got that he didn't deserve Emanuel Marrone  

48:26
and like I said we will get to all of those things 
before I get into some of your questions I want to  

48:31

USS Liberty episode thank you for bringing that   story to life because the history books don't I'm 
now a huge fan of yours you speak truth thank you  

50:26
thank you so much I appreciate that and yeah it's 
been a journey but we just have to unpack this   evil and we have to also just have the courage 
ourselves to recognize that this kind of evil  

50:36
exists like we got to kind of pop the bubble you 
know step out of the fairy tale and realize that  

50:41
there are some makers of the world without 
question and we need to definitively be able  

50:47
to look at someone like Emanuel mcone and demand 
answers because he's he in my view is just he's   on in control you know he's never been in control 
of his entire life he's a weak spineless little  

50:55
coward Mickey writes may God protect and bless you 
thank you for sharing your faith in Jesus Christ   Our Lord and Savior and the truth of the Wicked 
Ways of the abuse to children without question  

51:05
