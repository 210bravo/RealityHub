### Detailed Summary of the Episode

This episode of *Becoming Brigitte*, recorded on July 12, 2025, at 03:46 PM PDT (updated to 03:57 PM PDT per system note), marks Jean-Michel Trogneux‚Äôs birthday and serves as a pivotal installment in Candace Owens‚Äô investigative series. Focusing on family charts, identity discrepancies, a groundbreaking 1977 interview, and a surrounding "syndicate," Owens deepens her conspiracy theory that Brigitte Macron may be Jean-Michel Trogneux. The episode blends factual timelines with speculative leaps, incorporates sponsorships, and engages the audience, positioning Owens as a crusader against media manipulation and elite secrecy. 
#### Introduction and Birthday Context

- **Celebration**: Owens opens with a birthday song for Jean-Michel Trogneux, equating it to Brigitte Macron‚Äôs, setting the tone for exploring his identity as key to her narrative.
- **Apology and Recap**: She apologizes for not showing a family chart last episode, despite audience requests, and promises to clarify the complex names in the Macron and Trogneux families. 
#### Family Charts and Discrepancies

- **Emmanuel Macron‚Äôs Family**: The chart lists Jean-Michel Macron and Fran√ßoise Nogu√®s as parents, with [[Manette (Germaine Nogues)|Germaine]] "Manette" Nogu√®s as a significant childhood figure. Owens revisits Fran√ßoise‚Äôs role in facilitating gender transitions, calling it a ‚Äúbombshell‚Äù that allowed legal identity changes, and highlights her odd quote from *Just the Two of Us* (‚ÄúBrigitte is not a daughter-in-law‚Äù), suggesting an alternative relationship. 
- **Brigitte Macron‚Äôs Family**: The chart includes Andr√©-Louis Auzi√®re (husband for 32 years, three children: Laurence, S√©bastien, Tiphaine) and Jean-Michel Trogneux (brother, best man at her 1974 wedding). Owens notes Brigitte‚Äôs pattern of date errors (e.g., Maryvonne‚Äôs death, niece Sylvie‚Äôs death) and Tiphaine‚Äôs mistaken 2019 burial claim, framing it as intentional confusion. 
- **Implications**: Owens questions the legal ramifications of identity changes, using a hypothetical (e.g., becoming Jean-Michel Trogneux) to argue defamation suits could hinge on erased identities, a theme tied to Fran√ßoise‚Äôs work. 
#### Jean-Michel Trogneux‚Äôs Timeline and Disappearance 

- **Early Life**: Born February 11, 1945, Jean-Michel attended a Jesuit Academy (photos exist), lived in Algiers in 1963 (unusual post-independence), and was best man at Brigitte‚Äôs 1974 wedding. - **Photographic Erasure**: Unlike Brigitte‚Äôs scant pre-professor photos, Jean-Michel‚Äôs trail ends post-1977, with schools (e.g., Sacr√©-C≈ìur) refusing yearbook releases despite legal requirements, suggesting a cover-up. 
- **Marriage and Child**: Married V√©ronique Dru in 1982, had son Jean-Jacques (resembling Emmanuel), and divorced in 1987, with no wedding photos, adding to the mystery. 
#### 1977 V√©ronique Interview and Voice Analysis 

- **Discovery**: A 1977 French talk show features "V√©ronique," a transitioning individual with a shadowed face, whose voice and ‚Äúthat is to say‚Äù tick match Brigitte‚Äôs. Owens plays the clip, noting its explosive impact. 
- **Transcript Highlights**: V√©ronique describes a feminine psyche pre-operation, legal identity struggles (mirroring Fran√ßoise‚Äôs work), and a job as a craftsman with public contact. She mentions living with a woman, alluding to George Sand and Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, and cites gay poets Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud. 
- **Cultural Connections**: These figures tie to the Macrons‚ÄîChopin‚Äôs music in the √âlys√©e, Macron‚Äôs push to honor Verlaine and Rimbaud in the Panth√©on (rejected by Rimbaud‚Äôs family)‚Äîsuggesting a shared identity narrative. 
- **AI Confirmation**: Xavier Poussard‚Äôs AI voice analysis (rated top by the World Economic Forum) confirms a 100% match, aging accounted for, though Owens expresses unease about AI‚Äôs future implications. 
#### Andr√©-Louis Auzi√®re‚Äôs Mystery and √âlys√©e Involvement 

- **Death Discrepancy**: Tiphaine‚Äôs 2019 *Paris Match* claim of Andr√©-Louis‚Äôs burial on December 24 (corrected to cremation on December 28) is revisited, with Jean-Louis Auzi√®re‚Äôs account of an √âlys√©e-orchestrated rushed funeral. 
- **Photo Destruction**: Only a swimsuit obituary photo remains, hinting at systematic erasure, with Jean-Louis noting Africa tickets and emptied accounts from Andr√©‚Äôs partner. 
- **Psychiatric Claim**: Sophie Des D√©serts‚Äô unsued 2022 report of Andr√©-Louis‚Äôs psychiatric stay under Alexandre Benalla adds intrigue. 
#### Alexandre Benalla and the Syndicate 
- **Background**: Benalla, Macron‚Äôs 25-year-old security head during the 2017 campaign, became deputy chief of staff, living in the √âlys√©e. At 23, he was acquitted of violence against a woman. 
- **Banalla Affair (2018)**: Caught on video beating protesters as a fake police officer, Benalla retained diplomatic passports post-dismissal, meeting Chad‚Äôs Idriss D√©by (later killed in a coup), and had financial ties to Russian oligarchs. 
- **Syndicate**: Owens lists a network‚ÄîBenalla, Mimi Marchand (extortion, Best Image), Bernard Arnault (LVMH, *Paris Match*), Xavier Niel (intermediary), Nicolas Ghesqui√®re (transgender promotion), and Fran√ßoise Nogu√®s‚Äîalleging forgery, identity changes, and pedophile scandals surround the Macrons. 
- 
### Overall Narrative 

This episode pivots to Jean-Michel Trogneux as potentially Brigitte Macron, supported by the 1977 "V√©ronique" interview, voice analysis, and Jean-Jacques‚Äô resemblance to Emmanuel. Fran√ßoise‚Äôs transition work, Andr√©-Louis‚Äôs erased past, and Benalla‚Äôs scandals suggest a groomed elite with a syndicate (Marchand, Arnault) controlling identities. Owens positions herself as a truth-seeker against gaslighting, leveraging Poussard‚Äôs AI and audience support, with her book and club amplifying the narrative.

happy birthday to you happy birthday to you¬†
yes you guys guess what today is Jean-Michel¬†¬†

00:07
Trogneux's birthday in other words happy birthday¬†
Brigitte Macron the first lady Brigitte Macron so¬†¬†

00:14
excited to get into this to bring to audiences¬†
who exactly is Jean-Michel Trogneux where he¬†¬†

00:19
is we it's time to start that part of this¬†
series so welcome back to our series becoming

00:24
[Applause] [Music] Brit okay okay so some things to recap I was so¬†
frustrated at the end of the last episode because¬†¬†

00:45
so many of you had commented canis it's time for¬†
you to create a family chart and we had already¬†¬†

00:51
created a family chart I we just got so busy that¬†
I forgot to show it to you obviously on the show¬†¬† so I completely dropped the ball there I apologize¬†
of course when we are doing these sorts of series¬†¬†

01:00
like the Kamala series and now as we look at this¬†
Brit series it there's there are so many names¬†¬† it does become confusing and it's good to slow it¬†
down and be able to visualize who and what exactly¬†¬†

01:10
it is that we are talking about so let's kind of¬†
go backwards and start there I am showing you guys¬†¬† now the Emanuel macron family chart okay the these¬†
are allegedly saying allegedly here because I have¬†¬†

01:21
tons of questions as we get deeper into the story¬†
but his parents John Michelle macron uh then you¬†¬†

01:27
have franois no um obviously we spoke a lot last¬†
week particularly about Germain no who he refers¬†¬†

01:37
to affectionately as um manette right she's the¬†
one that shared this love of pedophile Centric¬†¬†

01:45
books with her grandson she is as we mentioned¬†
to you last week the only family member that he¬†¬†

01:51
includes in his childhood stories throughout his¬†
autobiography uh which is entitled uh Revolution¬†¬†

02:00
so wanted to get over that wanted to speak about¬†
Revolution understanding that this is that is¬†¬† actually the mccrone chart and then of course¬†
like I said his mother what we described yes on¬†¬†

02:09
last week's episode or a couple of days ago the¬†
episode was that Dr Francis no his mother when¬†¬†

02:15
she was first introduced to the world she was¬†
introduced as a pediatrician who helped out in¬†¬†

02:21
some capacity the Social Security office and then¬†
we had this huge bombshell in the last episode¬†¬†

02:26
where we learned just kidding by Social Security¬†
work we uh forgot to include the fact that she¬†¬†

02:32
helps transgendered and interex people secure new¬†
identities I mean that was a major major major¬†¬†

02:40
bit I mean that really it's explosive and¬†
it's important for you to remember that¬†¬† as we go along because that means that macron's¬†
immediate family was involved in helping people¬†¬†

02:51
okay who had gender issues to become someone else¬†
in other words they were facilitating the issuing¬†¬†

02:58
of real government IDs which allowed people¬†
to legally shed themselves of their former¬†¬†

03:05
identities and their true biological sex we have¬†
to wake up to the fact that that is the reality¬†¬†

03:10
of the world that we live in today so what is that¬†
what are the implications of that let's just pause¬†¬† there what are the implications of if I decide¬†
okay I'm Candace Owens nope I feel like actually¬†¬†

03:21
I was born a man and so I'm going to change my¬†
name I'm going to change my name to Jean Michelle¬†¬†

03:27
trno okay and then someone comes out and they¬†
say like you know Candace Owens is this person¬†¬†

03:34
can I then sue them for defamation for saying that¬†
I'm Candace Owens if I've legally changed my name¬†¬†

03:42
to Jean Michelle Chau that become the basis of a¬†
defamation Sho suit if you are able to shed your¬†¬†

03:48
identity I want you to think about that as we keep¬†
going throughout this series it's very important¬†¬† to remember this that his mother was dealing with¬†
this capacity in the Social Security office um I¬†¬†

03:57
should also add here that thereafter shockingly¬†
in a very rare interview his mother gave to a¬†¬†

04:04
journalist named Gail chaloff she was writing a¬†
biography about the macron couple biography was¬†¬†

04:10
entitled just the two of us and she spoke with¬†
his mother and his mother said something very¬†¬†

04:17
strange she said and I quote it's in this book¬†
for me Brit is not a daughter-in-law excuse me¬†¬†

04:27
what does that mean Brit is married to your son¬†
she's been married to your son for a very long¬†¬† time she fell in love with your son when your son¬†
was 14 years old what do you mean to me she is not¬†¬†

04:35
a daughter-in-law what is the implication of that¬†
what else could she be what else could the first¬†¬† lady be to you so we'll just leave that there okay¬†
now let's take a look at Bri macron's family chart¬†¬†

04:46
okay we've got um some other important things¬†
to remember so you have brigit who allegedly¬†¬†

04:52
was married for 32 years to this guy Andre Lewis¬†
oier okay and they allegedly had three children¬†¬†

05:01
Lawrence oier Sebastian oier and Tian oier now¬†
it's important to remember which we touched upon¬†¬†

05:08
last episode that the First Lady just routinely¬†
sort of gets things wrong in her interviews right¬†¬†

05:15
like she gets the date wrong from when her sister¬†
Mary vau died she got the date very wrong from¬†¬†

05:21
when her alleged niece died and we're starting to¬†
think of this is more of a strategy than anything¬†¬†

05:26
else like it's not just forgetting dates it's¬†
because you're trying to confuse the public¬†¬† and a big indication of that was tiffon okay her¬†
daughter getting both the date and the manner of¬†¬†

05:38
her father's burial wrong in Paris match magazine¬†
Weekly Magazine how is that possible remember we¬†¬†

05:45
talked about this we can bring up that chart again¬†
very weird mystery regarding this Andre Lewis oier¬†¬†

05:52
character we how weird it was we cannot emphasize¬†
enough we learn from his first cousin okay he had¬†¬†

05:59
a first cousin named John Lewis oer and that's¬†
where it got really confusing for some people¬†¬†

06:05
there is a first cousin and that first cousin¬†
then described that essentially he had sued¬†¬†

06:13
the journalist for misidentifying him in the¬†
wedding photo that first cousin then got upset¬†¬†

06:20
because the El Palace kind of played him into¬†
suing her for defamation pretending they were¬†¬† going to join the suit but then also brigit mcon¬†
refused to Simply say bring that picture back up¬†¬†

06:31
yeah that's me that's me in the wedding photo¬†
she refused to do this and just kind of backed¬†¬† out and so he wasn't happy with this the oers¬†
he was not happy he felt used by the L Palace¬†¬†

06:40
he opens up to a journalist and tells us some¬†
really strange things about his cousin's burial¬†¬†

06:45
about his cousin's funeral about his cousin's¬†
cremation mainly the strangest thing being that¬†¬† the El Palace was involved okay they wanted to see¬†
to it that this funeral was executed like a thief¬†¬†

06:56
in the night they did not want the public to learn¬†
about this and they were they saw it over the¬†¬†

07:01
finish line and yet despite this bit macron did¬†
not attend the funeral of her alleged ex-husband¬†¬†

07:10
of 32 years the alleged father of her children we¬†
want to make sure he's buried okay but we are not¬†¬†

07:18
going to show up neither me or the president are¬†
going to show up and then tfon is going to just¬†¬† make up what a massive mistake in Paris match¬†
and say I buried my father on December 24th¬†¬†

07:28
and then we learned no he was actually cremated on¬†
December 28th and it was a year prior and this is¬†¬†

07:33
the photo you use because everything everything¬†
was destroyed okay that's that's crazy so¬†¬†

07:40
yes remember that we learned that information not¬†
from a conspiracy theorist we learned this from¬†¬†

07:46
the cousin John Luis oier the cousin of Andre¬†
Okay the one who successfully sued Natasha Ray¬†¬†

07:53
for defamation because she wrongly assumed that it¬†
was him okay what we do know and we confirmed last¬†¬†

07:59
episode is that this man we can show you again¬†
his obituary photo because no other photos of¬†¬† him exist from the wedding photo to this his whole¬†
life has been destroyed what we can tell you is¬†¬†

08:09
that he did in fact exist they lied about where he¬†
worked what bank he worked at again tons of little¬†¬†

08:15
lies to send people down rabbit holes so they can¬†
make a mistake but what we can't tell you is what¬†¬†

08:21
exactly happened to him we cannot ascertain¬†
what happened to him based on the testimony¬†¬† of his first cousin because it depends on whether¬†
or not you believe his partner the woman who was¬†¬†

08:31
at his funeral who claimed that she found tickets¬†
to Africa in his pocket that he had emptied all¬†¬†

08:37
of his bank accounts and if you potentially¬†
or you could say and or if you believe the¬†¬†

08:44
journalist from Paris match who then wrote that¬†
Andre actually spent the last days of his life¬†¬†

08:51
in a psychiatric W being guarded by none other¬†
than Alexander banala now we got to talk about¬†¬†

08:59
this guy okay because he's important he's very¬†
important because he's come up actually a couple¬†¬†

09:05
of times but we should dig into deep of why that¬†
that particular allegation matters because it's¬†¬† interesting that despite the fact that they¬†
love to sue people they love to sue people they¬†¬†

09:16
never went after that journalist who claimed that¬†
Alexander banala the former deputy chief of staff¬†¬†

09:23
to Emanuel macron was guarding for whatever reason¬†
guarding a psychiatric ward door of Andre so we¬†¬†

09:33
know for a fact that El Palace was involved at¬†
the very least in his funeral and this journalist¬†¬†

09:40
put that so I think we should explore that so we¬†
should talk about Alexander banala because that¬†¬† is not a subtle mention from a journalist okay¬†
we had first mentioned Alexander banala in the¬†¬†

09:49
introductory episode when we told you about sort¬†
of this I don't know how to describe it like um¬†¬†

09:56
a Syndicate almost of pedophiles that's these¬†
accidental pedophiles that Emanuel macron keeps¬†¬†

10:01
Landing himself around okay we mentioned Olivier¬†
DL uh that was the man who was accused by his¬†¬†

10:10
stepdaughter of having molested her twin brother¬†
when he was 13 or 14 years old she wrote this¬†¬†

10:16
in a book and by the way because the statue of¬†
limitations had passed he was never brought to¬†¬†

10:21
justice but he admitted that it was true that¬†
he did in fact sexually abuse his teenage son¬†¬†

10:27
well one of the things that he helped because he¬†
was so close with Emanuel Marron with he helped¬†¬† him um when he landed himself in hot water over¬†
what what has come to be known in France as the¬†¬†

10:38
banala affair meaning Alex Ander Bala the Deputy¬†
Chief of Staff okay and now for whatever reason um¬†¬†

10:46
like I said we have no idea why this journalist¬†
mentioned but said Alexander Bala was guarding¬†¬†

10:53
the psychiatric word so I'm going to show you¬†
Alexander banala again that you can get him¬†¬† into your mind despite being extremely young¬†
I want to be clear he is today only 33 years¬†¬†

11:03
old he's got quite a remarkable professional¬†
resume okay when Eman mcon was running running¬†¬†

11:10
for president Alexander banala was just 25 years¬†
old and he served the candidate as his security¬†¬†

11:19
officer he was the head of his security okay¬†
once Emanuel macron got elected he then made¬†¬†

11:24
Alexander banala his Deputy Chief of Staff okay¬†
huge position could you imagine 25 years old and¬†¬†

11:30
you're like going into the White House y Palace¬†
it was then later discovered that these two had¬†¬†

11:36
an incredibly close relationship so close Emanuel¬†
took him on a ski trip with him and his family not¬†¬†

11:43
as the security like as like you're a part of¬†
the family on a ski trip and even closer than¬†¬†

11:48
that Emanuel macron allowed Alexander banala¬†
this 25 26 year old kid essentially to move¬†¬†

11:57
into the National Palace of the French Republic¬†
okay he was living at the palace of the alma that¬†¬†

12:05
is shocking he had residency here okay so what's¬†
going on here just imagine your 26 you're living¬†¬†

12:10
in a palace and I don't know I'm thinking he¬†
must have provided some incredible security¬†¬†

12:16
to the president he must have done the president¬†
some solids okay when you dig into his past you¬†¬†

12:21
learn that uh back when bonala was 23 years old he¬†
had been accused and then subsequently acquitted¬†¬†

12:29
of violence against a woman okay in so far that¬†
she said that she was rendered incapacitated to¬†¬†

12:34
work but as I said he was acquitted and then he¬†
became the head of Emanuel marron's security team¬†¬†

12:40
then when man mome was President a massive Scandal¬†
broke which come came to be known obviously as the¬†¬†

12:46
banala affair in 2018 when his Deputy Chief of¬†
Staff was actually caught on camera dressed as a¬†¬†

12:55
police officer beating protesters in the street of¬†
Paris I'm not kidding okay L man I told you that's¬†¬†

13:02
like the French New York Times broke the story¬†
they had footage of him it was undoubtedly banala¬†¬†

13:09
imperson a police officer and beating a young¬†
protester in the streets and then a second video¬†¬†

13:17
emerged which was published onto Twitter which¬†
showed bonala grabbing a female protester by the¬†¬† neck and dragging her away actually I'm going to¬†
ask my producer Skyler were we able to pull that

13:26
footage okay great let's actually show you¬†
um some of that footage this this is just¬†¬†

13:33
to make you guys understand this what you¬†
are looking at is a chief of staff of a¬†¬†

13:39
president beating up a protester he's going¬†
to come on in there in police uniform that's

13:46
[Applause] him look at [Applause] [Music]

13:51
this just totally normal Chief of Staff stuff¬†
right that's just what everybody's chief of staff¬†¬†

14:05
is doing all around the world um it would later be¬†
discovered Ed that as people began investigating¬†¬†

14:11
the story more and more that three police officers¬†
provided him with more surveillance footage¬†¬†

14:18
Alexander Bala they were giving him surveillance¬†
footage that had not yet been made available¬†¬† to the public essentially allowing for him to¬†
prepare his defense which signals to us that okay¬†¬†

14:29
they've got ties with the police officers clearly¬†
otherwise he wouldn't have been given the uniform¬†¬†

14:35
to wear as he pretended to be a police officer¬†
that day now president macron at the time of this¬†¬†

14:41
attack was in Australia he seemed incredibly¬†
reluctant to let go of his Deputy Chief or to¬†¬†

14:46
speak about the matter in any capacity publicly¬†
essentially which is why I guess he called up his¬†¬† dual friend what should I do what do you mean what¬†
should you do your chief of staff was just caught¬†¬†

14:55
beating protesters in the street why aren't you¬†
just more shocked at that what do you mean what¬†¬† do you do uh and it seems that Emanuel MCR might¬†
have been so concerned about this that he tried¬†¬†

15:07
to help Alexander out now why am I making that¬†
assumption again this is an assumption not a¬†¬† fact but it what is a fact is that Alexander Bala¬†
when he was being interviewed about the Scandal¬†¬†

15:17
no none other than Mimi marand was in the room to¬†
assist him speaking to the Press Mimi marand yes¬†¬†

15:27
uh the Pope the celebrity popess of the press who¬†
could get anything in the press anything taken out¬†¬†

15:33
of the press woman that could get the press to¬†
cover up pedophilia charges for her friends okay¬†¬†

15:40
eventually as the Scandal completely engulfed the¬†
El Palace they did in fact have to move to dismiss¬†¬†

15:46
bonala on paper at least I want to be clear on¬†
paper he was released because then another Scandal¬†¬†

15:51
emerged it would later be discovered that a few¬†
months later they realized they did not actually¬†¬†

15:57
remove his diplomatic passports and despite¬†
being seemingly fired several months later he¬†¬†

16:02
used those diplomatic passports to travel to meet¬†
with African leaders including the president of¬†¬†

16:09
Chad a guy named Idris Deb now for people that¬†
are watching this from Africa you're looking at¬†¬†

16:16
this guy going didn't he die a few years later¬†
in kind of one of those stereotypical Western¬†¬† scenarios where suddenly a group of rebels Rises¬†
up give me like a moo marafi type situation and¬†¬†

16:26
the rebels are just so unhappy and they kill the¬†
president yeah that's what happened to that guy¬†¬† in Chad yeah so but I'm sure it was totally¬†
organic and people were really unhappy in the¬†¬†

16:35
streets and like the West had nothing to do with¬†
it nonetheless Alexander Bala was meeting with¬†¬† this guy on diplomatic passports after he had been¬†
fired so it was a second part of the Scandal it¬†¬†

16:46
then emerged that while he was working for macron¬†
Alexander Bala this 26-year-old Palace living King¬†¬†

16:54
had actually contracted Financial ties with two¬†
Russian oligarchs who were said to be members of¬†¬†

17:00
the Russian mafia oopsies again I guess everyone¬†
around me is accused of being either a criminal a¬†¬†

17:07
pedophile so what I'm sh Min grown is always just¬†
so innocent in this pit it just keeps happening to¬†¬†

17:14
them they're trying to work with good people guys¬†
they're really trying to surround themselves with¬†¬† good people I swear it's everyone around them it's¬†
just not them I think that we should actually take¬†¬†

17:24
a look here at this extraordinary Syndicate that¬†
is emerging around them because we've covered a¬†¬†

17:29
lot of these people so Michelle Maron obviously¬†
the pop s up there on the left right of the French¬†¬†

17:35
media we know she's been inded in in dirt she's¬†
been kicked out for y extortion you name it she's¬†¬†

17:41
been accused of it a woman that we understand had¬†
the capacity the only person that people had to go¬†¬†

17:47
through to get photos of the first lady's past¬†
she owns best image okay and you're telling me¬†¬†

17:53
this is the only person that can produce images¬†
from bit mcc's past before uh she became a a¬†¬†

17:59
professor or a teacher uh seems a little suspect¬†
uh then below her we have Bernard Arno richest¬†¬†

18:06
man in the world because he controls LV MH um we¬†
mentioned his son-in-law Xavier Neil who was the¬†¬†

18:14
in between the go between between Mimi marshan¬†
and the first couple but I want you to also know¬†¬†

18:20
that lvmh owns Paris match okay so that's where¬†
she's putting all of these doctored airbrushed¬†¬†

18:27
images I would say airbrushed images of brigit so¬†
that everyone thinks she's like young and looking¬†¬†

18:33
and irresistibly hot she's working on that then¬†
we'll jump up to the right corner there we mention¬†¬†

18:39
Nicholas gascar is the person that's dressing the¬†
first lady also under the lvmh Empire the one who¬†¬†

18:45
is just putting transgendered people everywhere¬†
he can honestly you should just Google Nicholas¬†¬† gasier in your in your spare time because we¬†
didn't even scratch the surface in terms of how¬†¬†

18:54
dedicated he is to the trans cause and bringing¬†
all these trans models and putting them on the¬†¬† runway and trying to trans trans trans everything¬†
but I'm sure brigit mcon is exactly who he says he¬†¬†

19:04
is um and just I don't know just wants to dress¬†
briet mcon for whatever reason it is what it is¬†¬† is then of course as we mentioned um Emanuel¬†
macron's mother Fran no who we know is concerning¬†¬†

19:15
her work to trying to get individuals who suffer¬†
from identity issues new identities and doing this¬†¬†

19:24
by the way this is legal this is legal now okay¬†
and then we have there on the bottom who we just¬†¬†

19:29
discussed was Alexander vanala so just just piece¬†
all that together okay with forgery extortion and¬†¬†

19:37
most importantly with access to a woman who can¬†
facilitate the changing of identities it is not¬†¬†

19:44
enough for any person investigating this case¬†
to ask questions like is this brigit trau in¬†¬†

19:51
the wedding photo you will notice we didn't¬†
ask that question when when my legal team¬†¬† got involved we didn't say is this brigit trno in¬†
the wedding photo we had to instead ask something¬†¬†

20:00
more specific is this the current first lady¬†
of France brigit macron pictured here in this¬†¬†

20:10
wedding photo okay and that's when the couple¬†
gets real quiet they don't want to answer those¬†¬† questions do you guys get what what I'm getting¬†
at here okay because we can confirm that that is¬†¬†

20:21
indeed a photo of a woman named Brit trogo in that¬†
wedding photo where that Brit is we cannot confirm¬†¬†

20:30
because the first lady refuses to answer she has¬†
a mother-in-law who helps transgendered people¬†¬† get new identities so you have to essentially¬†
understand that you can just take somebody's¬†¬†

20:42
name you can take you can become somebody else¬†
at a moment's notice now legally when you become¬†¬†

20:49
transgendered okay this brings us to Jean Michelle¬†
trogo okay we we obviously have to discuss him¬†¬†

20:57
this is Brit trag no's brother today is his¬†
birthday happy birthday John Michelle trno it's¬†¬†

21:03
really important that we learn about him a guy who¬†
was so close to his sister two different people¬†¬†

21:09
his sister bit trau that she made him the¬†
best man at her wedding but then he just was¬†¬†

21:16
completely missing from mention when the first¬†
lady Brit Marron came into Power seemed to be¬†¬†

21:24
purposeful to allow this person to fall through¬†
the cracks despite all of the stuff being written¬†¬† about her family and where she came from there¬†
was no mention of Jean Michelle trau that was¬†¬†

21:33
the dog that was not barking we're going to talk¬†
about him we're going to allow that dog to bark¬†¬†

21:39

23:49
let's speak about John Michelle drug no this has¬†
been trending in France this has been explosive¬†¬†

23:55
everybody knows something's going on here but the¬†
English speaking world did not understand what¬†¬†

24:00
was happening and there are a lot of questions¬†
even in the French speaking World they don't¬†¬† understand why it is that Xavier pussard has¬†
not been sued for defamation but matasha Ray has¬†¬†

24:09
what is the difference um Xavier busard was always¬†
very clear with me that his major breakthrough¬†¬†

24:14
came thanks to the work of Natasha Ray she came to¬†
him and first said like this is John Melle trog no¬†¬† I've been working on this so where did she fumble¬†
the ball and where did he not fumble the ball and¬†¬†

24:24
this is where it gets really interesting and¬†
it is why it was so important for me to slow¬†¬† that down for you that we are talking about two¬†
different individuals um Jean-Michel Trogneux and¬†¬†

24:34
his sister brigit trno what you should know about¬†
Jean-Michel Trogneux was that he was born born on¬†¬†

24:39
February 11th 1945 and regarding his existence¬†
there can be no question in fact it is a stark¬†¬†

24:46
contrast to trying to look into Brit trno unlike¬†
his sister Brit trno who like her husband appears¬†¬†

24:54
to have nearly every trace of her existence¬†
magically wiped destroyed you cannot get your¬†¬†

25:00
hands on documents in fact bjit trno person who's¬†
claiming to be in the El Palace as Brit marro¬†¬†

25:09
you think it'd be very easy to get school pictures¬†
of her you can't get them Xavier pussard has gone¬†¬†

25:16
through Court processes in order to get his hands¬†
on a yearbook that should be supplied by law okay¬†¬†

25:25
she went to S Sacred Heart sakur qua I hope I'm¬†
saying that okay in French Saka qua and they're¬†¬†

25:31
supposed to give you the yearbook so you can¬†
look at a picture despite this the school is¬†¬† refusing to do that now why would a school refuse¬†
to give you a photo of the first lady of the first¬†¬†

25:43
lady growing up why can't we see pictures of the¬†
first lady in yearbooks that are in existence why¬†¬†

25:49
can't we see her in elementary school in Middle¬†
School in high school why why is that why is it¬†¬† that every trace of brijit TR NOS existence is¬†
impossible to Garner and it was also difficult¬†¬†

25:59
but not impossible to Garner um stuff about¬†
John Michelle trno and we were able to piece¬†¬†

26:05
together a very clear timeline of his existence¬†
until he kind of magically falls off of a cliff¬†¬†

26:11
so we will walk you through this timeline okay¬†
John Melle told you born in 1945 we then know¬†¬†

26:19
that he begins attending a Jesuit Academy we have¬†
multiple photos of him um at a Jesuit Academy and¬†¬†

26:27
and I'm going to show you one of them I believe¬†
that we have here um yep so if you look there¬†¬†

26:32
on the far right bottom you will see that that is¬†
John Michelle trno Okay and like I said I'm going¬†¬†

26:39
to save some of the photos that we have because¬†
Xavier pussard is going to be our next episode¬†¬† that interview and what he worked to get his hands¬†
on is explosive and I do not want to ruin that for¬†¬†

26:48
him jumping back into our timeline uh in 1953 his¬†
little sister Brigitte Trogneux was born um then¬†¬†

26:56
we know like I said that he continued to attend¬†
that Jesuit Academy then we have that famous¬†¬†

27:03
1944 family picture which best image released¬†
to the documentary maker who felt like she was¬†¬†

27:09
for whatever reason being uh questioned by the El¬†
pilot that were be treating her like they like she¬†¬†

27:15
was under interrogation she was able to get her¬†
hands on that family picture 1955 to 1956 he's¬†¬†

27:24
back at school again we will have those class¬†
photos available for you in Xavier's interview¬†¬† in our sitdown which we will be releasing next in¬†
1960 uh Brit and John Michelle trag's Sister Mary¬†¬†

27:36
Von trno dies in a car accident with her husband¬†
hband Paul farsy on February 24th their daughter¬†¬†

27:42
Natalie 5 months old at the time survives and goes¬†
on to marry a guy named Richard and they have two¬†¬† daughters in 1963 uh the public is then given¬†
a photo of what we are told is the real brijit¬†¬†

27:55
trogo um at Communion we note that this does not¬†
look like the current first lady and the current¬†¬†

28:00
first lady has thus far to this day declined to¬†
answer my question about whether or not not if¬†¬†

28:06
it's brijit trno in the photo but whether or not¬†
it's her in the photo important differentiation¬†¬†

28:12
in 1963 Jean Michelle trno lived in algers algers¬†
Algeria in February so he was 18 years old this is¬†¬†

28:21
a highly unusual thing as Xavier told me because¬†
this was just after the bloody war of independence¬†¬†

28:28
Algeria getting their their independence from¬†
France and he says at this time no Frenchman¬†¬†

28:34
went to Algeria unless they were Communists but¬†
we know that he was there because there was a¬†¬† available and we are Keen suddenly to get a photo¬†
of him around this time because well now we're¬†¬†

28:46
not talking about kid photos which seems to be¬†
the only thing brigit mome wants to release um¬†¬†

28:52
a very small amount a total of what three photos¬†
that were released doesn't want to release any¬†¬† older photos until suddenly uh brijit Marron¬†
is a professor right briet oier says oh I'm a¬†¬†

29:03
professor we're just kind of like missing these¬†
important years of her life which would allow us¬†¬† to see the face sort of mutate over time right¬†
this next photo which I'm not going to show you¬†¬†

29:14
because it is explosive and it took Xavier pussard¬†
years to get he gets his hands on a photo of Jean¬†¬†

29:22
Michelle trogo who is enrolled in the estb TP¬†
School uh which is a French engineering school¬†¬†

29:30
that becomes the last verified photo that we have¬†
on record but I want you to note he is 18 at this¬†¬†

29:37
time you take any person you take a photo of them¬†
when they're 18 and it is very hard to say that¬†¬†

29:43
you were expecting this person to look majorly¬†
different right um decades on from that because¬†¬†

29:49
you are a a young adult right jumping back into¬†
this timeline we then know that the real brijit¬†¬†

29:57
trno marries Andre Lewis oier becoming brigit¬†
oier we have a wedding announcement we have a¬†¬†

30:04
wedding photo it actually happened and that is the¬†
photo uh which Natasha Ray made an unfortunate and¬†¬†

30:10
totally understandable mistake regarding and then¬†
like I told you for whatever reason John Michelle¬†¬†

30:17
photographically disappears he disappears and¬†
then this amazing thing happens in 1977 when¬†¬†

30:26
people started recognizing that their first¬†
lady something about the story didn't make¬†¬† sense when people began first speaking about¬†
their suspicions that they were looking at a¬†¬†

30:35
transitioned man um for many reasons they¬†
were able to dig up an interview okay from

30:43
1977 and it's a man who says that he is¬†
transitioned and living as a woman named¬†¬†

30:54
veronique now for my English listeners this is¬†
going to be um a bit confusing for you so I'm¬†¬†

31:01
going to describe to you why this was so explosive¬†
every person that speaks you can transition your¬†¬†

31:07
name you can try to speak in a different tone but¬†
you have ticks you know almost things that you say¬†¬†

31:14
that you don't even recognize that you say words¬†
that you might rely on and for first lady macron¬†¬†

31:20
that tick so to speak is she says that is to say¬†
right that is to say some people might say like¬†¬†

31:30
you know like I was going to like the store and¬†
like her tick is that is to say that is to say so¬†¬†

31:37
we have this individual who appears does not show¬†
their face it's shadowed on this talk show in 1977¬†¬†

31:44
says their name is veronique and says that they¬†
have transitioned and the person has the exact¬†¬†

31:50
same voice as the current first lady of France¬†
and the same tick and of course at the time that¬†¬†

31:59
the first lady was doing all these interviews she¬†
never thought the public was going to dig up this¬†¬† old interview of this transgendered individual¬†
on a talk show saying that that is to say that¬†¬†

32:09
is to say over and over again so I'm going to¬†
play a little bit of this interview of course¬†¬† it is in French so this will mean nothing¬†
to English listeners but then I'm going to¬†¬†

32:18
read you the transcript because there's some other¬†
important coincidences that happened take a listen

33:05
now essentially someone in the chat here just¬†
said that's her voice but also someone who said¬†¬†

33:12
in the chat that this you could refer to this¬†
as a a voice footprint that's a perfect way to¬†¬† say it's a voice footprint there are things that¬†
you just can't rinse yourself of but also even¬†¬†

33:22
when you transform your identity you still have¬†
an identity you still have interests that don't¬†¬†

33:27
magically go away if you change your name okay¬†
this is why I'm going to tell you what she says in¬†¬† the script if I'm Candice Owens even if I change¬†
my name to Jean Michelle TR no doesn't transform¬†¬†

33:38
my interest it doesn't make me I love Italian¬†
food I'm not going to suddenly like not like¬†¬† Italian food because I become Jean Michelle trog¬†
no I'm not going to suddenly not be interested in¬†¬†

33:48
the Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds case because¬†
I changed my name legally to John Michelle trogo¬†¬† and so this interview was explosive when it was¬†
released because of things that veronique said¬†¬†

33:57
so I'm going to pull up the transcript for you in¬†
English and read you what this is translating into¬†¬†

34:03
so the interviewer asks uh he says to the audience¬†
I can only guarantee the this the authenticity of¬†¬†

34:09
veronique's testimony veronique I'd like to know¬†
if when you had this operation which is the one¬†¬† you've had it was a difficult moment for you or¬†
was it just the culmination of something that¬†¬†

34:19
had happened before barique says I don't think¬†
there's any transformation because the psyche is¬†¬† already feminine and the individual in this case¬†
me is already prepared for this kind of M mutation¬†¬†

34:29
out of necessity in the sense that we feel like¬†
women and we merely normalize a situation there's¬†¬†

34:35
no transfer there's normalization interviewer¬†
says so you're completely a woman how long ago¬†¬†

34:42
did you have the operation interestingly enough¬†
um she doesn't answer that part of the question¬†¬† of when she had an operation but she goes on¬†
and she says answers I don't really like the¬†¬†

34:52
words completely a woman in other words we¬†
become a kind of woman who can copulate but¬†¬†

34:58
cannot procreate hence the legal problems we'll¬†
be talking about later in other words integration¬†¬†

35:03
goes smoothly on an individual level they only¬†
exist on a social level okay so already she's¬†¬†

35:11
starting to speak about this trouble that we know¬†
that Emanuel maron's mother is going to concern¬†¬†

35:16
Herff with which is like okay there are these¬†
legal problems with who we identify with and who¬†¬† we we we know we're women okay but we have these¬†
legal hoops and barriers and this is why I'm I'm¬†¬†

35:27
breaking and telling my story because we have to¬†
change this we have to be able to change this the¬†¬† univie says you have a job that we're not going to¬†
reveal here let's just say it's a job that's about¬†¬†

35:36
the public there are responds that's right I'm a¬†
Craftsman I have regular contact with the public¬†¬†

35:42
I'm in close contact with customers I don't have¬†
any problems I used to because I had a phenotypic¬†¬†

35:47
gender meaning an ambiguous appearance they took¬†
me for what I wasn't uh a homosexual which wasn't¬†¬†

35:54
the case either in my behavior or in my way of¬†
thinking but unfortunately this image resulted¬†¬†

36:00
in non-integration um uh this is partially¬†
cut off here for me but it says uh non- integr

36:08
a and actually and actually I normalized a¬†
situation for my integration and I live very¬†¬†

36:19
legally and honorably for civil status purposes¬†
it is possible to change your first name to an¬†¬†

36:26
ambiguous one this is very important because¬†
it enables integration or pseudo integration¬†¬†

36:32
into society in the sense that there are always¬†
problems but they can be solved administratively¬†¬†

36:37
by mut ual agreement but legally there's no¬†
solution unlike All Foreign legislation except¬†¬†

36:43
the Belgian legislation which is modeled on ours¬†
the interviewer then ask do you feel that you¬†¬† are now completely yourself and you don't have any¬†
problems identifying yourself since your operation¬†¬†

36:53
veronique says to tell the truth I only had¬†
identification problems towards others not with¬†¬† myself I saw myself as what I was a woman with a¬†
body that didn't belong to her it's very difficult¬†¬†

37:03
to conceive for someone who's comfortable in one's¬†
own skin I use the term comfortable in one own¬†¬† skin because it's the typical image because¬†
I didn't have any problems but people created¬†¬†

37:13
problems now I don't have any problems to tell¬†
the truth this operation um that is the removal¬†¬†

37:19
of this useless organ in our case because it is¬†
both unusable and unused and the interviewer asks¬†¬†

37:25
her do you live alone veronique says I'm not¬†
with anyone but I've lived with a woman and¬†¬†

37:32
conceived this Union in the style of George sand¬†
and chopan chopan was probably a transsexual his¬†¬†

37:41
style of Melody the way he plays makes this quite¬†
clear I think the image that has been given of¬†¬†

37:46
the rimod verlon Union is a distorted caricatured¬†
image that doesn't correspond at all this is very¬†¬†

37:55
important okay she has this speech tick it's¬†
exactly like bri macron's if you spoke French¬†¬† you would understand that but she also mentioned¬†
musical composer Frederick chopan plus mentioned¬†¬†

38:06
gay poets Paul Lan and Arthur rimod now why is¬†
that significant okay well these poets they were¬†¬†

38:12
in a homosexual Affair um you know but violent¬†
very violent relationship so she's clearly coming¬†¬†

38:19
across as someone who is tremendously educated¬†
this is not some random person right this is¬†¬† somebody who has been educated in the classics who¬†
is on this show for the purpose of trying to move¬†¬†

38:30
along legislation to be able to make it easier¬†
for people who are trans to secure identities¬†¬†

38:35
that is the purpose of this appearance right¬†
and as I said the purpose of using someone who¬†¬† has sort of this ability to communicate and speak¬†
about the high Arts is to make people perhaps the¬†¬†

38:45
audience is more sympathetic with the Cause right¬†
she's saying I was always a woman which is funny¬†¬† because as I read that I also what's ringing¬†
in my head is that sentence that brigit and¬†¬†

38:57
Emanuel wrote to me in the first legal letter they¬†
said she does not owe you any proof that she has¬†¬†

39:03
and always will be a woman like very strange very¬†
strange thing to write like almost like I believe¬†¬†

39:10
it and therefore it is and of course you do owe¬†
me proof you're going to say that you're going to¬†¬† sue me in a Tennessee Court you absolutely will¬†
be owing me proof If you're going to say that I¬†¬†

39:17
defamed you but going going back to the mention¬†
these these classical mentions regarding chopan¬†¬†

39:24
the first couple when they were creating their¬†
legend in the public claimed that they had moved¬†¬†

39:30
a piano into the LA palace because Emanuel macron¬†
remember the virtuoso loved to play chopan for¬†¬†

39:38
bit and for brigit only so this is something¬†
this matters to the couple okay regarding the¬†¬†

39:43
homosexual poets that she mentioned uh Paul verain¬†
and rimod Emanuel macron while acting as president¬†¬†

39:51
considered admitting them both into the pantheon¬†
the the which is it's where they bury all of these¬†¬†

39:59
French Heroes okay and this sparked a massive¬†
debate like should these people first off one¬†¬†

40:06
of the lovers shot the other one had to serve time¬†
in prison would this be a good thing to move them¬†¬† he was going to honor them as this like homosexual¬†
these homosexual poets and greats by burying them¬†¬†

40:17
in this significant structure but what ended up¬†
happening was Rod's family firmly rejected that¬†¬†

40:25
um honor because they did not want his legacy to¬†
be reduced to a gay icon so that's just incredibly¬†¬†

40:32
fascinating right it's incredibly fascinating¬†
that you have this person veronique and she's¬†¬†

40:38
saying and mentioning all the people that we¬†
know have this significance in the relationship¬†¬† between Emanuel macron and Brit and she has after¬†
somebody used an AI voice analysis they said that¬†¬†

40:50
this was 100% the same person and you know I don't¬†
know much about these softwares but for somebody¬†¬†

40:56
to come out and to declare that this is 100% the¬†
same person and the only difference is that the¬†¬† The Voice has aged to have the same ticks it's¬†
a lot of coincidences it was it was Major when¬†¬†

41:06
this happened and when this was revealed and then¬†
there are some more interesting things to remember¬†¬†

41:12
here okay when you jump back into the timeline¬†
so veronique appears we don't know what what¬†¬†

41:19
this person's name is in life they're using this¬†
name for this interview veronique no last name we¬†¬†

41:24
don't know anything else but don't forget that¬†
this person also said that he's not in a real¬†¬†

41:29
relationship but he lives with a woman okay barque¬†
says he lives with a woman well when we jump back¬†¬†

41:37
into to our Jean Michelle trno timeline we find¬†
that at this time Jean Michelle trau following¬†¬†

41:45
this interview marries a woman and ironically her¬†
name is veronique so could it be possible that¬†¬†

41:55
John Michelle took on the name of a dear friend¬†
named vinique who he was living with and who he¬†¬†

42:02
then moved to Mary we don't know because of course¬†
there are no pictures of this wedding there's¬†¬† nothing there's nothing there John Michelle trno¬†
on paper gets married to a woman named veronique¬†¬†

42:13
Drew okay and then they have a child they have¬†
a child in 1982 named John Jack that's the John¬†¬†

42:22
Jack that looks tremendously like Emanuel Marron¬†
and then shortly thereafter in 1987 John Michelle¬†¬†

42:30
divorces veronique Drew so ladies and gentlemen¬†
what is going on on serious like just like what¬†¬†

42:39
is going on in this story what is happening¬†
how do we have these actors who are unable to¬†¬†

42:47
produce images from these very relevant things¬†
that happened in their lives you know where is¬†¬†

42:53
John Michelle drag no you got married to a woman¬†
are there no pictures from your wedding day no¬†¬†

42:59
you just dis and you decided to just fall off¬†
a cliff and stop being photographed at the same¬†¬† moment that Brit mcon the Professor the teacher¬†
was born suddenly like no more photographs for¬†¬†

43:12
you what what is going on here why have why do¬†
we have a situation in which schools which are¬†¬†

43:19
legally required to release photos I believe¬†
the the law in France is after 50 years any¬†¬†

43:26
person can get any photo of somebody that is in¬†
school right you can release the earbook photos¬†¬† why are they refusing to release photos of who¬†
was supposed to be the first lady in elementary¬†¬†

43:38
school and in middle school and in college why why¬†
can't we get these photos why are people having to¬†¬†

43:44
go through court and be GID to get these photos if¬†
it's really you brigit mccrone and you didn't take¬†¬†

43:51
on the identity of your sister if it's really you¬†
why are you struggling to answer basic questions¬†¬†

43:59
forget the conspiracies why are you refusing to¬†
answer basic questions while trying to push people¬†¬†

44:07
to sue for defamation waiting for people to make¬†
mistakes why not just clarify are you the same¬†¬†

44:14
person pictured in this wedding photo are you¬†
brijit trno how much more basic of a question¬†¬†

44:21
could I have asked you whether than did you Brit¬†
Marron give physical birth to three children okay¬†¬†

44:30
do not allow people the media to Gaslight you into¬†
thinking that you are asking of something that is¬†¬†

44:36
just such an invasion of priv y it is completely¬†
nutty okay it we are Beyond lunacy when we are¬†¬†

44:43
talking about such basic questions that could¬†
have put this all to bed a long time ago and we¬†¬†

44:49
are like eight years in to them instead preferring¬†
to legally try to punk people to scare people to¬†¬†

44:57
intimidate people sending out thugs potentially¬†
okay and when we look at that nebula when we¬†¬†

45:03
look at the surrounding and The Supporting¬†
Cast of Emanuel macron and bit Maron do you¬†¬†

45:09
feel comfortable with what's going on here is it¬†
every day that you need to have someone who forges¬†¬† documents around you allegedly Mimi marshand she's¬†
still facing trial right now someone who's been¬†¬†

45:20
involved extensively in extortion who's facing¬†
trial right now for extortion is it normal to¬†¬† just keep having these sort of gang type members¬†
around you people that can control images that¬†¬†

45:29
can edit images and put it in the Press like¬†
are are are we going to accept as the p as the¬†¬† public that this is completely normal that they¬†
just keep Landing into these pedophile scandals¬†¬†

45:41
or are we going to recognize that something very¬†
Sinister is going on that Emanuel mcon and briet¬†¬†

45:47
mcon are not presenting themselves as who they¬†
say they are as what they say they are I believe¬†¬†

45:52
they were groomed for this position I believe¬†
especially Emanuel macron without question was¬†¬† groomed by bit there's no question about that¬†
the only question that remains is who the hell¬†¬†

46:01
is briet mccrone and the obvious answer to me and¬†
after you see these photos that you are going to¬†¬†

46:08
see one in particular um from when John Michelle¬†
trno was 18 you're going to fall down like I did¬†¬†

46:13
when I saw it it's just it's completely crazy it's¬†
completely crazy and thankfully for the work of¬†¬†

46:19
Xavier pussard the one thing that helped him not¬†
make mistakes was that he was using an AI program¬†¬†

46:28
which the world economic Forum has rated the¬†
number one facial detection software which allowed¬†¬†

46:34
it allowed him to avoid making mistakes it's the¬†
same program is used by China right obviously you¬†¬†

46:40
know they have in China the social credit system¬†
and everyone's face they have to be able to tell¬†¬†

46:46
apart right very similar faces they have to be¬†
able to tell apart and this was ranked as the¬†¬† number one software to be able to do that and so¬†
when he thought something he ran the software like¬†¬†

46:57
with the wedding photo he ran the software and he¬†
said I know this guy looks like this guy but the¬†¬†

47:02
percentage on this software is saying that the¬†
cousin and the man are two different people so¬†¬† he didn't run with that theory he didn't go just¬†
based off of his gut instinct he also was being¬†¬†

47:12
aided by a software which was giving him answers¬†
before he even really knew what the answers were¬†¬†

47:17
we'll have more on that when I sit down with him¬†
uh but do know that the software he is using has¬†¬† the blessing of the world economic forum and I¬†
think we've all figured out that that forum is¬†¬†

47:27
pretty evil and they want us all to be able to be¬†
identified and the software I had to tested out¬†¬†

47:34
myself to believe in it it's incredible I mean you¬†
can take a woman when she's 6 years old she could¬†¬† have had 20 surgeries in her face to transform¬†
her face and it will still go that's her 80%¬†¬†

47:45
chance I've never seen anything like it it kind¬†
of terrifies me about our future it terrifies me¬†¬† about AI in general but for the purposes of his¬†
investigation um it really allowed him to sort¬†¬†

47:55
things and he there's no question uh upon seeing¬†
this technology uh in my mind that Jean-Michel¬†¬†

48:01
Trogneux is Brigitte Macron the only question¬†
that I have is what happened to his sister¬†¬†

48:07
trog now and you'll get to that as well like I¬†
said I didn't want to give us too many spoilers¬†¬†

48:13
ahead of the interview I sit down with him but um¬†
there's just more there is there's so much more¬†¬†

48:20
for us to unpack the Rothchild connection the jobs¬†
that he got that he didn't deserve Emanuel Marrone¬†¬†

48:26
and like I said we will get to all of those things¬†
before I get into some of your questions I want to¬†¬†

48:31

uh unpacking the Charles Manson Murders the CIA¬†¬†

49:56

to understand a lot of these programs which we¬†¬†

50:01

50:26
thank you so much I appreciate that and yeah it's¬†
been a journey but we just have to unpack this¬†¬† evil and we have to also just have the courage¬†
ourselves to recognize that this kind of evil¬†¬†

50:36
exists like we got to kind of pop the bubble you¬†
know step out of the fairy tale and realize that¬†¬†

50:41
there are some makers of the world without¬†
question and we need to definitively be able¬†¬†

50:47
to look at someone like Emanuel mcone and demand¬†
answers because he's he in my view is just he's¬†¬† on in control you know he's never been in control¬†
of his entire life he's a weak spineless little¬†¬†

50:55
