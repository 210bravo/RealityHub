## Summary

[[Dr. Jack Kruse]], former food lobbyist [[Calley Means]], and otolaryngologist [[Dr. Mary Bowden]] engage in a heated discussion about the public health crisis, pharmaceutical industry corruption, and environmental factors driving chronic diseases. [[Jack Kruse, MD|Kruse]] passionately argues that centralized medicine, influenced by Big Pharma, suppresses [[Quantum Biology]] solutions (e.g., sunlight, [[Cold thermogenesis]]) to keep populations sick for profit. He accuses Means of being a [[Fabian Society]] socialist with ties to globalist agendas, alleging Means’ family connections to [[David de Rothschild]] and the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] (CFR) undermine his health advocacy. The podcast blends Kruse’s health protocols—Leptin Prescription, Epi-Paleo diet, cold thermogenesis—with conspiratorial claims about vaccines, [[MK-ULTRA]], and globalist control, highlighting a clash between Kruse’s confrontational approach and Means’ more diplomatic stance.

### Key Concepts Discussed

1. [[Quantum Biology]] and Health Optimization (00:00:00–00:09:59, Public Health Crisis):
    
    - Kruse frames health as a quantum process, with mitochondria acting as [[Semiconductors]] that harness sunlight, water, and magnetism. Artificial light (blue light), EMFs, and processed foods disrupt mitochondrial redox potential, causing diseases like obesity and diabetes.
    - Protocols include morning sunlight exposure (20–30 minutes) to reset circadian rhythms via [[Melanopsin]], cold thermogenesis (5–10 minute cold showers at 50–60°F) to boost mitochondrial efficiency, and the Epi-Paleo diet (high-fat, DHA-rich foods like salmon) to support leptin pathways. Gulhane and Bennett reinforce these circadian and light-based strategies, with studies (Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, 2010) supporting their metabolic benefits.
        
2. Leptin Prescription and Hormonal Health (00:46:14, Food vs Pharma):
    
    - Leptin resistance, driven by blue light and circadian misalignment, underlies metabolic disorders. Kruse’s Leptin Prescription involves a high-protein, high-fat breakfast (50–75g protein), minimal snacking, carb timing at night, and evening exercise (HIIT or weights). Dahhaj promotes these practices, with research confirming protein’s role in blood sugar stability.
        
3. Bioelectrics and [[Robert O Becker|Robert Becker]]’s Influence (00:59:20, Jack’s Experience with ICU Patients):
    
    - Kruse cites Becker’s research, showing tissues like bone act as semiconductors, transmitting electric currents for regeneration. EMFs disrupt these bioelectric fields, exacerbating disease. Grounding restores cellular charge, a concept Bennett simplifies for practical use.
        
4. Critique of Big Pharma and Centralized Medicine (00:09:59, Calling for a Ban on Pharma Products; 01:25:26, Hidden Agendas):
    
    - Kruse argues that Big Pharma profits by treating symptoms with drugs, suppressing natural solutions like sunlight and cold therapy. He calls for banning harmful pharmaceuticals, particularly COVID-19 vaccines, which he claims contain contaminants like DNA plasmids and SV40 promoters (02:59:46, DNA Plasmids & SV40 Promoter). [[Mary Talley Bowden MD|Bowden]] supports this, citing vaccine-related harm, while Means advocates gradual change through transparency and lifestyle improvements.
    - Kruse’s Kruse Longevity Center applies quantum biology, with case studies showing health improvements via environmental alignment.
        
5. [[Calley Means]] and [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] Socialist Allegations (00:30:31, [[Calley Means]] Work History; 01:00:28, Jack on Calley’s Mom & Pancreatic Cancer; 02:53:54, Jack’s Problem with Calley):
    
    - Kruse accuses Means, a former food and pharma lobbyist, of being a [[Fabian Society|Fabian socialist]] and CFR member, implying he’s a covert agent for Big Pharma and globalist agendas. He claims Means’ father, Grady Means, worked for [[David de Rothschild]], a prominent CFR figure and alleged eugenicist, linking the family to a transhumanist agenda to control health narratives. Kruse alleges Means’ mother died of pancreatic cancer, possibly vaccine-related, and a missing death certificate conceals this (01:11:29, Missing Death Certificate).
    - He criticizes Means for not directly calling for a COVID-19 vaccine ban, suggesting his diplomatic approach protects Big Pharma interests, particularly those of [[Susie Wiles]], [[Donald Trump|Trump]]’s chief of staff, who Kruse claims is tied to vaccine manufacturers (,). Means’ sister, Casey Means, is implicated as a potential Surgeon General nominee, allegedly to deflect vaccine scrutiny by focusing on less controversial issues like processed foods (,).
    - Kruse connects Means to the CFR, which he claims was birthed by Fabian socialists like John Foster and Allen Dulles, aiming to control populations through health, technology, and finance (). He cites Means’ book (Good Energy, co-authored with Casey) as a distraction from vaccine harms, accusing him of being a “Fabian created to destroy MAHA [[Make America Healthy Again]] for BigHarma”.
        
6. Nefarious Relationships and Globalist Agendas (01:31:46, [[Council of Foreign Relations]]; 01:33:41, MK-ULTRA; 01:36:25, [[World Economic Forum]]):
    
    - [[Dr. Jack Kruse|Kruse]] alleges that [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] socialists, through the CFR, orchestrate a globalist agenda to control health via pharmaceuticals and technology. He links this to MK-ULTRA’s historical mind control experiments, claiming blue light and vaccines are modern tools for population control.
    - He accuses the World Economic Forum (WEF) and CFR of funding black operations, citing Las Vegas’s mob origins and Mossad ties as financial conduits (from #263 - Exiled Brain Surgeon,). Means’ alleged CFR membership and family ties to Rockefeller are framed as evidence of complicity in these schemes.
    - Kruse claims the “deep state” opposes figures like [[Donald Trump|Trump]] and [[Robert F Kennedy Jr|RFK]] Jr. for threatening biotech interests (01:47:40, Trump, Kennedy & the Health State of Emergency; 01:52:23, Why Jack No Longer Supports [[Robert F Kennedy Jr|RFK Jr]].). He alleges Means’ connections to Trump and Kennedy (02:19:55, Calley’s Link to [[Donald Trump|Trump]] & Kennedy) are strategic to subvert health reform.
        
7. COVID-19 Vaccines and Contamination (02:59:46, DNA Plasmids & SV40 Promoter):
    
    - Kruse and [[Mary Talley Bowden MD|Bowden]] call for banning COVID-19 vaccines, citing [[Kevin McKernan]]’s research on DNA plasmids and SV40 promoters as evidence of contamination linked to cancer (e.g., Means’ mother’s pancreatic cancer). Kruse urges Means to examine McKernan’s data, accusing him of avoiding the issue to protect Big Pharma.
    - Means resists, advocating holistic health improvements (e.g., addressing processed foods, light exposure), leading to a clash with Kruse’s confrontational stance.
        
8. Decentralized Medicine and Health Reform (02:03:16, How Jack Would Reform Health in the US):
    
    - Kruse promotes decentralized medicine, empowering individuals to use sunlight, cold therapy, and diet over pharmaceuticals. He contrasts this with Means’ gradual approach, accusing him of aligning with Big Pharma’s interests.
        

### Critical Examination

Kruse’s quantum biology claims, like mitochondrial light emission, align with emerging research (e.g., quantum effects in photosynthesis, Nature, 2010) but lack clinical validation. His health protocols are partially supported by studies on circadian rhythms and cold exposure (Nature Reviews Endocrinology, 2014), but their specificity (e.g., exact protein timing) is anecdotal. His allegations against Means and [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] socialists are highly speculative, relying on unverified family connections (e.g., Grady Means and Rockefeller) and X posts (–) rather than documented evidence. The CFR and [[Fabian Society|Fabian socialist]] links echo historical critiques of globalism (e.g., your April 7, 2025, inquiry about Fabians), but Kruse’s claims about Means’ mother and a missing death certificate lack substantiation. Reddit and Substack feedback () praises Kruse’s insights but questions Means’ authenticity, noting his rehearsed demeanor and reluctance to address vaccines directly, possibly to avoid blacklisting. The podcast’s conspiratorial tone risks overshadowing valid health critiques, requiring primary source verification to separate fact from speculation.

the following podcast is an electric conversation between Dr Jack Cruz CI means and [[Mary Talley Bowden MD|Dr Mary Bowden]] Dr Jack Cruz is a neurosurgeon for over three decades CI means is a former food lobbyist who famously broker the partnership between RFK Jr and [[Donald Trump]] before the 2024 presidential election and [[Mary Talley Bowden MD|Dr Mary Bowden]] is a board certified Odo laryngologist specializing in respiratory illnesses she also treated over 6,000 patients during the recent plague due to the subject matter this episode had to be heavily censored to avoid violating any of YouTube's policies none of the content has been cut out or removed only specific words have been muted but we posted the raw uncensored adree version on patreon if you want it hold on tight Hammer that subscribe button below and enjoy the show nonnative emfs baby okay wow all right are we rolling all right everybody thank you for coming I'm glad we were able able to make this happen Jack welcome back thank you Mary nice to meet you nice to meet you kie nice to meet you good to see you so uh we wanted to make this happen Jack you were here about two weeks ago and uh two months ago oh yeah that's what I meant to say two months ago and ever since then and I think even before then you have been uh fired up to say the least um about cie and his sister Casey and some of the messaging that they are pushing on various podcasts and social media they are talking a lot about the hyper processed foods and Pharma and you've been questioning uh I think a lot to do with like their background where they come from and and their messaging in particular and Cali I think that you feel that some of the stuff Jack saying is untrue and in bad faith essentially you hit me up about two weeks ago saying you'd be more than a month ago like a month ago yeah you you contacted me and said I'll come do a podcast with Jack let's try to get in the room and try to Hash your stuff out in real time well to be honest uh initially what I saw as the discussions you were having about Ultra processed food not being part of the solution light which I think is a very important part and is more of a scientific thing so that's when I initi about a month ago I mean there's definitely been frankly more personal things which we can talk about as much as we want I think the science part is interesting too but I hit you up before seeing a lot of the personal attacks still wanted to do this I mean I think a lot of people are skeptical um this was your idea yeah well to to to engage on the right and and I've been chatting with Mary about you know various things in good faith I think and um but um yes I I the personal attacks are what it is we can talk about that as much as you want but um I don't think they're personal attacks okay okay but but um I think there's a massive moment in the country right now where I think we probably all agree that there's a historic opportunity to maybe reset the agenda on health I think there's great part of the problem yeah I think there's great opportunity and great uh there's a lot of support yeah there's opportunity but I don't think I don't think the opportunity is being taken to the Forefront by you or your sister by pushing the food issue the big opportunity right now why people are dying is sv40 y is the Jabs and Y to cut straight to the chase you and your sister wrote the book tell us why the word vaccine doesn't show up once time in the book okay so let's let's back up um there's an opportunity in this country right now in my opinion to talk about the holistic poisoning of the American people okay but we just came off the biggest we got let me answer the question we have to let each other we have to we have to let each other talk and breathe it's hard to do with four people so we're just going to make sure that we give everyone a chance to speak and then take we take our turns and try not to talk over each other because it makes it listenable for people that are listening so I'm going to tell you what my story is and how I see this opportunity and what I've been doing and you guys can tell me if you disagree or agree and we can go from there if that works okay so my mom as you know died you've been talking about my mom um and I believe that she is a product of what's happening in general to Americans to the average American which is we have a holistic set of hijacking of ourselves in mitochondria and in our book we talk a lot about over Pharmaceuticals and the corruption of the pharmaceutical industry and I think the mandates and vaccines and what happened during as I've said for years is one of the greatest scandals in American history I think was the single worst public policy mistake of my lifetime and that includes the mandates on the vaccines that includes the lockdowns which set a generation of kids back it's absolutely a war crime and think we're going to be dealing with that for a generation and still unpacking it and there was a wild report that came out just a couple days ago I think my mom and kids in the average American I think their circadian rhythm is being hijacked I think light is a huge issue it's something that we talked about in the book an entire chapter I think Jack your insights on that are extraordinary and and mind-bending and um and I think it's obvious that what's happening to our circadian rhythm is dramatically impacting our hormones I mean I was just with a friend who's raising chickens and in order to have them laid two times more eggs they just turn the lights on and we're doing crazy stuff to humans and obviously that's messing with their hormones to a significant degree I think that sedentary lifestyle and the fact that a child in a school gets less time outside and less time active than a maximum security prism is a huge issue and we think food's a big issue I mean I think I think in ways we don't even understand about the toxins and the science experiments happening with our food um and I think all those things came together for my mom and they coming together for a lot of different Americans and the book was about this multifaceted threats the American people are facing and because of the pharmaceutical industry I think corruption that profits from sick kids that basically is incentivized for a child to get sick very young to poison those kids um I think that what the incentives in this country are it's super dark and you know that message that you know came together from my sister after leaving the medical system inspired me a lot you know that came together after my mom's death um is is why we wrote that book and just to get into what you know you've been saying Jack um I started talking about that a couple years ago and tuo Carlson's producer dm' me on Twitter about two years ago I went on his show on Fox my sister's been doing podcasts for years and then I went and chatted more and more about this and started unpacking this issue a multifaceted attack on ourselves from the incentives of medical system um and you guys talk about jumping on the scene or whatever my sister and I went on to Tucker Carlson's podcast a while back it was the most shared podcast of the year and we wrote a book that's has sold a lot and and we have been I've been working to get this message out and I think that Bobby Kennedy being on the national stage is a miracle and I think that President Trump talking about these issues at a high level as a miracle and I think it's bipartisan because a lot of these issues used to be talked about on the left so I think that's a great thing and um and that that's that's where I come at it from so um I I I think I think the stack ranking you know Mary I'll turn to you but like I think my story on you is that you've seen a lot of pain and a lot of a lot of really bad situations and harrowing patient stories yeah I mean we are coming off of the biggest Public Health crisis in our lifetime and you know while I completely agree with your message I mean our food supply is has a lot to be desired it is it's a Insidious health problem that's poisoning our kids I completely agree with that but the shots are a more immediate and dangerous threat to our population children are still getting shot today think crime wait all babies all babies this is our own government is are recommended to get three mRNA shots and this is synthetic modified mRNA Shots by the time they're nine months old right and we wezy and we know we know that uh we have an abundance of data we have over 3,400 peerreview published studies showing adverse reactions we we know that it in young people The increased risk of myocarditis is at least four times we this is an immediate threat and these Cod shot should have been pulled off the market a long time ago and my feeling is that if you have a large microphone and you are in the public health space that you are ethically obligated to speak out about this issue and I understand that this is not your issue right and we've talked about this yeah I mean the trans problem is not my issue but I authentically feel that this this gender modification in children is wrong so I do speak I I authentically feel that in any way pushing Jabs particularly on kids is an absolute War crime and I've you feel like the shots should be pulled off the market so so so that is not a policy stance that I'm going to say it's not a policy St are you giving your children are you giving your children a shot are you gonna give your okay well why not I I think there I think that that makes no sense what because you you have reluctance about their safety hold on right hold on can I can I respond to this yeah so this issue of overprescribing medications for kids the schedule for kids spe specifically hold hold on um you seem to be drawing a line of whether I'm calling for an immediate ban as a policy platform verse what I'm saying personally just personally can you say personally personally personally I I think I think it's an absolute travesty how we've been misled how these were FastTrack do you feel like the shot should be pulled off the market yes or no I I'll give you my personal opinion I think there should be absolutely no mandates so hold on hold on okay I I I think I think that we have an opportunity the next year to truly reset science this is what I feel and we have an opportunity to have Jay bashara who's a close friend who I you know strongly push to be at the NIH to call everyone together review the science have Truth and Reconciliation bring that out to people and have a process for that I think it's a general so so so Jack the answer is no the answer is no that a wait that is a policy position that I'm calling for the shs to be immediately pulled from the mar no you're not answering the question you're doing exactly what you're training hold on hold on Jack that's the reason we're sitting here Jack Jack um I am saying that as a policy position I think that we should have Absolute Data transparency no mandes we have too much dat Jack Danny just had Kevin K on the podcast let me talk Jack you let me talk now hold on hold on you let me talk let let me ask you a question let me ask you a question and this is not like a debate I don't see this as a debate I actually legitimately I don't think it's a debate either hold on Jack why are you so angry because I don't trust you okay I think you're full of [ __ ] and Mary just uncovered why you're full of [ __ ] because you can't say yes or no let me just tell you something Callie when you say to the American public that my children can't have the shot but we can't say anything for anybody else to me that's in Congress so you would argue that Trump and Biden should come out Trump and uh RFK should come out with an immediate ban of theot today absolutely it should have my my point is your recomendation it should have happened with operation warp speed it should have happened in the first month correct I think it's a policy process we need it we need to have truth and Recon let talk about the policy process of the swine flu when we had 70 vac injured kids and we pulled it off the market hold on hold on what is the debate I'm saying there should be an immediate review of the data an immediate that's not the answer I'm giving my answer yeah but that's not the answer I'm giving my answer and then I sincerely want to hear from you if you are giving a presentation to the Administration what your detailed argument would be to pull the shots universally today I and that's not like a debate I actually want to understand what my answer right now is that the mandates especially for kids the mandates in general are an absolute crime the way science has been hidden on this is a crime the way they've been fast-tracked and pushed is a crime the way they have been covering up all thetic as a crime oh we shouldn't call it hold on and and that and that my policy process would be absolute transparency absolute transparency do you know how many people died in the first month following the roll out of the Cs I yes or no VI is the only sponsor of this episode and for good reason for 2025 I'm focusing on the natural effects of CBD in my life if you didn't already

what's with the animosity dude I told you already I don't trust you worth a damn okay why well well hold on can we do you know how many people died the first month uh no 700 and that's that were reported 10x compared to the swine flu that was pulled in 76 J Jack what what would be your argument if you're talking theoretically to a leader who's making this decision um I just gave it to you what would the walk the listeners through like like for the iMed I don't want to walk the listeners through I want to walk you through walk me through what Jack I'm not making these decisions like I got news for you I got news for you the way you sold yourself to the people in DC would say otherwise I got news for you I happen to know that's true okay so I think you might be getting bad information but I don't think so I I I I think you are but um what is the argument this is like this isn't a debate like like we should get this out like like well we would if you just said yes but we're not did I want to immediately ban the shots correct that's that's the answer not the policy of RFK that's not the policy of trump so RFK doesn't want want to pull the no he's not calling to immediately pull he's calling for utter truth jbot shar's calling for utter truth that is what I think we have an opportunity to do I am I'm not calling the shots in any way shape or form but I am very passionate Jack about transformational change right now and coming up with recommendations for True transformational change I think the way to change the Paradigm on this stuff is to be frank absolutely not coming out with immediate bans on things like this so hold on I think it is I think it is having a national conversation and a reset of Science and having a full truth and unbias science we all know we both know that the truth right now is that they're not asking these questions and there's huge coverup of getting the right information and getting the right data we all know that we all know that they've already made recommendations to the American people for kids and that there's huge institutional pressure to have any data that second guesses the guidance that they've already given to people's children imagine I see it right I know about this from my experience Jack there's incredible institutional pressure to have anyone look imagine the liability of that imagine the liability if the data you're saying talking about actually comes out so that's that's what we're hold on that's what we're that's this is infu I the DAT has been sitting there for years now we'll walk us through it hold on a second I think the obvious biggest problem with this is that nobody can be informed on the truth about it because I can have somebody in here like [[Kevin McKernan]] who's an expert in this stuff and then YouTube will pull the thing off of the internet compl which happened which just happened so so there's no transparency on one side anybody who questions these products on the internet gets completely silenced I think that is the number one issue with it we're not going out and banning FR Loops everybody knows FR Loops are bad for you everybody knows smoking new ports are bad for you but have a choice you have a choice to do it and a choice not to do it and I want to say something about RFK because you know we have been fighting so hard the last four years to get this information out to the public Kennedy was our big hope Kennedy was finally he was the one that's going to you know get in get in a position of power and even if he didn't win the presidency he has this gigantic microphone and then all of a sudden his message shifts his his Focus shifts he's our nuclear bomb we're in World War III he's gonna he's going to take down Japan all of a sudden the nuclear bomb the target has shifted to food and came on and hold let me finish and this coincided with this meteoric rise with Casey and CI means who none of us had seen I am curious and don't answer yet because I want to keep talking but I I am curious about what you were doing during the pandemic but well we're not sure but you came on and and great we love your message and I have told you this we want you to join forces with us but uh and I don't you know you say it's a purity test I I I it's an ethical test I mean you have this gigantic microphone and you you have the ability I mean you have the ear of trump and Kennedy and I'm also very curious about that I say you're the one that called that orchestrated the call between Kennedy and Trump and Kennedy says this he he this is in his speech that you orchestrated the call between Kennedy and Trump to have Kennedy drop out of the race and endorse Trump and that is very you know how did that happen very curious um so go Focus has shifted and that's our big concern and it it coincides with your rise I mean six months ago I I'm sh I looked this up you had about 19,000 followers on Twitter 6 months ago now you have 230 something thousand it's amazing good for you because you have figured out how to get that information that you want to get that out and that is commendable and that's what we all want we want our message to get out we just can't we can't get it out and so maybe you could tell us your secrets how to do that we can get into but but but but but high level do we not feel optimistic about the moment that we're in for no more why don't you feel optimistic I don't think Bobby is who I thought he was why uh just the things that have developed over the last probably four to six weeks I mean he seems to be completely unaware before him and his sister on the scene about the Constitutional Amendment that I wrote for bu Kelly everything was in this law to wipe the the Slate clean completely and Bobby calls me up and says says I don't think even Rona santis could pass this law and this is when Rona santis was in the race with Trump before Susie WS for people who mag for people who are listening who aren't familiar with that law can you explain it for us yeah I mean I I went to moved to El Salvador four years ago and literally uh [[Bitcoin]] gets announced as legal tender and happens and bu Kelly is not you know a scientist every every body knows that but he listened to the people in his health Ministry who were forerunners tied to World economic Forum wh FDA you know all the same people that fouchi left to and he went along sign the contract with fizer and started inject people and he started to see immediate problems in his country so he went on Twitter and he said who's this crazy neurosurgeon that keeps saying all these bad things but no one's shutting him up how'd that happen it's one of my patients is Jack dorsy who owned Twitter at the time so there was no chance I was going to get silenced so what happens they bring me back into a place to meet the president and I give them a talk that's chat and rules 20 things that we need to do right now people in his administration tapped me after the talk and they said look these ideas are pretty good would you be willing to meet with the president next 24 to 48 hours so I went met the president in the basement and I told him the story about Benjamin Rush and I told him exactly what Benjamin Rush [[Thomas Jefferson]] and James Madison talked about that we should have had a medical Freedom law in the Constitution but because the two Founders went back and could not find 5,000 years any civilization where this was the attack Vector for a government they decided not to put it in everything was good until 1982 when Reagan put fouchi in and that's when everything went wrong and 1986 is when 80 is the why why are you not optimistic well I'm getting there okay part part of the reason is because you can't answer the question which question Jack I'm trying to have a good dialogue here yeah I don't think you are I don't think you're in good faith Ja Jack why people many of the people that were behind the pandemic are people that he's worked for in the past that's the real issue for me and I don't know what like who just relax you let me talk I do I want to have a good conversation so the interesting part of this is when bobby gets the law and he tells me what he tells me about the sis I get a phone call about four weeks later from him and he goes can we use four pages of the law in our platform this is before maah ever comes out then I get a phone call from Aaron Siri his Healthcare attorney saying we'd like to help you format the law to get it in I said you don't have to worry about it's already a done deal in El Salvador um then this is before Nicole is actually tapped to be the vice president she says would you go and do a podcast with Bobby but it's got to be in a place that it can't be canceled kind of like you know well you just face with Kevin right so I called one of my other friends and patients up Rick Rubin famous music producer I said no one's canceling him so Bobby sits down with me and we talk and at that meeting the the most key thing happens Nicole gives me talking points that she wants me to discuss with Bobby and I refuse to do it I go straight to the heart of the matter to something that Bobby knows about very few other people did and that's the day that I dropped in his lap that [[Kevin McKernan]] found sv40 in the fiser jaam and he never knew that prior to that he knew exactly what it meant because of the book that he had written with fouchi from Fort Dietrich onward right but what this podcast became a big story about was Uncle Jack knew everything from Fort dich backwards the polio and I knew something else to really catch Bobby off off base is that when Jim Garrison talked to his father we covered this in the other podcast that Bobby Kennedy at 8 years old was the one that answered the phone there was no way for me to know that when David Ferry was killed right so what is that messaging which is what you're getting to the heart of the matter that he doesn't understand that this is proof positive this is a bioweapons program that spans 75 years that alone should end everything that's going on with why sv40 is not on any of the fda's paper I don't need Jay bateria I don't need Bobby Kennedy I don't need [[Donald Trump]] it's not in any of the regulations and because it's not it needs to end immediately not only is it grossly illegal it's not ethical and it's nefarious and anybody who says otherwise automatically is looked at badly and that's the real reason I don't trust you are youw because you cannot you cannot answer Mary's question which is why are you still F the jobs Jack you can think whatever you want I don't have to you just said what you said to the people on this podcast Jack Jack it's a litness test you don't want to take Jack I am my mission on this Earth is to subvert the evil dark broken incentives of our pharmaceutical industry and the incentives for the American people to be sick which I think has super dark I feel like we're listening to another ad hold on Jack Jack why what's with the anger you don't know me dude dude I got news for you I think I know you I don't think you do I think I do okay well we can talk about that but um what what do I think the jab should be pulled immediately I think that what happened with is evil and I think it's I don't think you even know what happen I don't I don't know what you're saying right honestly Jack I don't right I think that what you're saying I think that what you're saying and the threads you are pulling should have maximum airtime should be absolutely seeing the sunlight and we should have absolute Fearless discussion and Truth the funny thing is they are and guess what the Jabs are still out there guess why because you haven't convinced enough people no because the people that you work for and the people that are in Washington DC still in power Well Jack we have I think an optimistic situation that's happened the last month I don't think it's as optimistic as uh you think I am really optimistic I think I it's optimistic for Froot Loops but not for the job I think there's well I I think there's a lot of um I think there's a lot of Darkness I think there's going to be a lot of subversion I think progress is probably going to be more incremental than you and I want but I think we are standing right now at a more optimistic time to get truth out and change some of these incentives than we ever have and the truth is you feel that way Mary n i i is there I I I think I think I'm very curious what happened to you during the pandemic did you he was busy writing a book well I mean seriously did you have what was the hardest thing what was the what what what's with what's with your like who do you think I worked for what I know I know who you are you're a globalist okay that's you want to give you want give what do you mean specifically by that well all you have to do is look at his LinkedIn page and then do a cursy you know examination of his family history but the big one that really concerns me is his past work history that's one I haven't talked about on Twitter yet that's the one I saved right here okay so Cali when he left Stanford went and did his Harvard NBA and that's when he started to meet some other Harvard guys took some jobs and started working for companies that are tied to transhumanist technology but the big one which one which would that be Bose Allen that was I interned there as a sophomore doesn't matter there's a trend here my friend the next one let's talk about Daniel J Edelman in Holdings yeah let's talk about that that was before Harvard do you know who Daniel J I do I do and I've made why don't you tell me about it why don't you tell the audience who Daniel was Jack I've done 200 podcasts talking about hold onop nobody gives a [ __ ] about your podcast right now dude answer the question let him explain Jack Jack going to Stanford working at Edelman working at Mercury public affairs going to Harvard Business School seeing inside the [[Council of Foreign Relations|Council on Foreign Relations]] these are foundational to who I am and what my story is and see that Darkness I agree with that and seeing that Darkness right those are all globalist of course of course globalist elst founded hold on hold on Jack you you haven't you hav supporting Jack Jack you haven't read our books or listen to our podcast well if you don't think that me and my sister eviscerate the the book a big portion of the book is explaining how the Rockefeller family is one of the most evil families in American history okay my dad worked for the Ford Rockefeller Administration for two years 50 years ago uh these uh Rockefeller connections and the Rockefeller money that we have that's news to us okay he worked for the Ford Administration and he was a mid-level assistant for rights President not Nelson Rockefeller for not [[David de Rothschild]] who I don't even know who that is or you say a lot that was 50 years ago [[David de Rothschild]] founded the Council of foreign relations with which you're a member I that's that's news to me I've been to one Council of forign relations meeting in my life so what is what is the Council of forign relations then call then tell the audience because I'm glad you said that why is it linked everywhere that your name is why do you always put it out there and first of all what is it well well hold on well just answer the question hold on hold on tell your LinkedIn profile right now yeah the answer that it has is I haven't updated my LinkedIn profile in a couple years that's pretty convenient don't you think considering where we're going with this because you still haven't answered the question about who Daniel J Edelman is uh tell the audience who he is he is the leader of the largest public relations and public affairs from in the world that I worked for 13 years ago what's the method that he describes and studies Jack you're being very menacing let's have a let's have a just warming up brother just try to let him talk Jack let's have some love here Not Gon to happen what what what why like what I don't know who told you all this uh Darkness like it's curious I have I have security people that find lots of things out K okay well I'm I'm curious I'm looking forward to hearing them so so Edelman as we write about and talked about incessantly and I'm happy to repeat for you um created a Playbook to rig institutions of trust they they actually made a lot of their um money with cigarette companies and they helped bribe um scientific organizations to say how cigarettes you know basically question they actually didn't even say they were healthy the goal was to actually show how uh cause confusion okay so uh throughout the' 60s 7s ' 80s they ran the playbook for the cigarette industry to basically rig institutions of trust to pay off Regulators to have confusing information to have doctors and advertisements so this is a large Public Relation form that basically created that Playbook now as cigarette uh smoking declined uh they took on other interests like food companies um oil companies um you know other other other Industries like that and they use the exact same Playbook and they actually shifted their clients from the cigarette industry to the food industry as the cigarette Industries bought the food industry in the 1990s and then those were clients that I had when I was there 12 13 years ago and as I talked about I actually watched and helped um you know Steer money from the American Beverage Association to civil rights groups and two academic groups and actually watched as food companies you know paid off and tried to confuse Americans with research you know such as we we we make a mockery of this but such as you know crude oil food coloring being you know safe when they're basically faced out of other countes so we those were the projects I worked on and then at the same time Edelman represents the world economic Forum you know and goes to these fancy confabs and says how good they are and good people they are how many how many times is uh David J edelman's son Richard David David is Dad Richard Richard's the CEO yeah he goes every year he goes every year Edelman is can can you tell the audience about his new wife she's the former uh public relations person for for the world economic Forum interesting and do you know that she's got a link to the current president of uh Mexico that supports NAFTA that's also another Rockefeller Jack I think call found the foundational like the foundational attribute of my story we all have pass Nicole was married to Sergey Bren like you're being paid on hold on Jack here's the key though the Rockefellers are behind the jab and you won't take the litmus test hold on hold on you can laugh all you want dude this is funny um okay so so so your is Edelman and these you know kind of firms that I used to work for tied to a potentially very dark globalist regime correct yes that's the foundation of my story I went to Harvard I went to Stanford I was two people tied to arpan go ahead keep going okay so I went to Harvard went to Stanford have seen inside some of these circles still am involved in some of these circles and I am trying to talk about how even well-meaning people in some cases are part of terrible incentives that when it comes to healthc care field are no matter what they say or what they even think in their head are part of what made you decide to go to sequential jobs that actually sought out the darkness well hold on so so I went to Stanford Darkness Harvard Darkness well okay well being honest I think I think I think I think again I'm not laughing I'm being very serious here why [Music] because I'm not done talking C you're asking a question yeah but I'm not asking your question you just asked three questions but go ahead what's your question my question is this did you listen to the last podcast that I did with Danny uh I've listened to a lot of your stuff and list did you listen to the one that I did with Danny specifically I listen to almost all of it okay so you know about the link to MK Ultra did you know that Daniel Edelman was part of MK Ultra did you know that no well he is Steve why don't you pull up his uh his Wikipedia and you'll notice that he was tied to psychological warfare see that right there in [[WWII|World War II]] did you know that and do you know what the methodology for Edelman is my friend goes all the way back to the 1921 book written by Edward Beres yeah yeah propaganda Jack I just described it well but my question is cie why do I keep finding your name and your dad's name and your sister's name tied to globalist people yet when this young lady over here ask you the question why you failing the litmus test on Jabs but not on fruit lips can I may I respond yes um well let let me let me back up Jack because you might not know let me just give my story and where my heart is and you can poke wherever you want does that sound good let's do it okay um my sister and I were raised in Wasing DC we have a wonderful parents my dad worked as a grew up in a trailer worked as an economic advisor I said for Ford and Rockefeller and was a consultant in Washington DC and my mom was the greatest woman we knew and for whatever reason my sister and I were very concerned with going up the ladder and achieving good professional success in the traditional sense so we worked hard we got of Stanford I studied economics and political science my sister studied biology I was really into politics so I went into campaigns right after school and then inevitably a lot of people go into public affairs lobbying Consulting things like that so I did that and worked at two companies Mercury public affairs and Edelman and as I've talked about a lot I definitely saw some of these really dark arts of basically just confusing the American people um about areas like food areas like pharmaceutical products and it was really really dark I didn't put all the pictures together but those are the two companies I worked for um and um I don't know about the Rockefeller ties but these were two I told you the council Foreign Affairs was started by David R okay so so so so I worked at two prominent public affairs firms then I went to Harvard Business School and then I've been doing startups my sister went to Stanford Medical School she was despite what you said like did very well did residency had what I would call Spiritual Awakening probably similar to you in some ways that this system is pretty dark and it profits from people being sick and exploring that there's multi-dimensional poison of our mitochondria including circadian rhythm food things like that but basically that she didn't learn about these things so she left in 2017 started impacting me I was doing startups other things and um kind of came together for me during so where was I during I was closing down my previous e-commerce company living with my sister um thinking a lot about how dark and bad the public policy was around and the lockdowns my mom's experience as we talked about in January 2021 had a big impact on me I started speaking out speaking out about the co and other issues in 2021 really coming on um thinking about this saying how crazy it was to be mandating them hold on and then yes help my sister write a book in 2021 2022 started speaking more about this stuff um uh as far as the Rockefeller connections that's news to me and and maybe they're so good that they're you know subconsciously and so who's the who's the agent for your book uh Inkwell publishing the what's the agent's name Richard Pine you know where Richard Pine is linked to he's Rockefeller Foundation hold on hold on Callie you just got finished eloquently stating that you're not part of that hold on hold on guess what Avery and penguin have confirmed to me who your agent is and I I've done some homework was it Richard no it was Inkwell publishing no no no no Richard I'm going to tell you something C goe the more you talk the Digger the bigger hole you're digging and so well we're going to talk about your mother here very very shortly okay okay because that is the big impetus okay for your book so your your mom tell tell the audience where your mom lived tell your where did your mom live one second I want to I want to ask a question first I want to ask you mentioned there was a spiritual awakening your sister had well yeah what was the point for you was there a specific jump off point or Spiritual Awakening from you to step away from lobbying wait yeah yeah I I'll get to that um so Jack I'll just kind of give um again where where the heart is we decided to write a book in the middle of yeah what's wrong with that that's kind of big considering the stuff that's been going on are you suggesting that we're part of some conspiracy where Rockefeller helped place the book and then and then and then a conspiracy to get a million people to buy the book I don't think I'm I'm actually saying anything I'm I'm actually looking for answers from you because I don't think that you're being very transparent you'll have to explain how the conspiracy is that a lot of people have bought the book well but you're the first time author right very unusual for first-time author and you're not the first person to give this message I mean this message has been going out for 50 years you just managed to overcome what most people can't and get it that message out to most of America which is amazing and and I'm I want to know how you did it so we can because I mean that's the answer are you suggesting like Edelman the people I'm attacking in the book help with the book I'm just trying to understand what the logic is I actually think that your agent knew exactly how to sell this book why because it fits with their uh agenda 2030 that's exactly what maybe you're just maybe you're being used you I might be I might be I if this is a big conspiracy Jack then I don't think the word conspiracies come up except out of your mouth well well saying that I actually think that the interesting part here is feigning ignorance and fraud like fainting ignorance about what I I believe you're fainting ignorance right now about what I think fraud and ignorance are two words that are next to each other I would like to know where you're line between ignorance and fraud Jack Jack fing ignorance about our agent being connected to the world economic Forum that's the ignorance I I'd kind of like to hear you say what what is your policy to write a food book during Cod it's not a food book while while you're Jack Jack it's not a food book has one it has two chapters on food it has it's got recipes in the book it's it's not a food book it's not it's a it's a book about the multi-dimensional threat now we're going to rewrite the history since I read the book Ja Jack and to be fair Callie does talk a lot about the pharmaceutical industry and pharmaceutical drugs not so much about vaccines Dan Danny let me let me give him let me give him two points because Mary said something earlier that I I and I do want to give agreement with Cali that most of of the things that he's talked about on Rogan and on Tucker I have zero problems with like his stance on food his stance that he's turned against those dark Forces I am willing to concede 100% okay that is not what Jack is pissed off about okay it's the transparency he's a he's a public relations guy a lobbyist what did they do it's legalized lying so I want to make sure he's not still lying because when he we ask him the question right that we ask him about the elephant in the room which is the messenger RNA jab you already had Kevin on here and you know the deal you're not even a science guy right understood there is there is a huge stigma and a huge group think that is attached to the conversation because people know you you get blasted off the internet you you get completely scrubbed if you talk about that and you make that your main talking point so my question would be is there which was not which was not which was not Danny did I get did I get blasted off the internet you did not you are a well you're Jack you are a unicorn but Cali is there a strategic is there a strategic reason that you may be and it's I can see a reasonable reason why you would choose not to attack the and try to go a different route and then come come later and like take it one piece at a time piece meal the problem so no that has not been a strategy the strategy was that we wrote what was in our heart like in this book and that I am on a constant journey and learning I have thought that mandates and the policy around was really really bad like and we talked about book and um and we we talked about that I think I think there is Jack Mary I think there is a question of given this moment right now what the policy and what the strategy should be and I do strongly believe that we should start with transparency that's my opinion and and you might think that's a kind of weasly way to get to the issue and that it's such a crisis that we have to just bang the table right now on specific issues I do strongly believe that from a public policy perspective we should start with transparency and that's a good place to start to bring the American people along I know you think it's too I get that but but okay I'll explain what I'm actually thinking but um we have a huge problem with trust right now I I see it every day in my office I have patients coming to me who say who can I go see I have people crying in my office on a regular basis over what happened during I mean that's not normal ent's do not normally hand Kleenex to their patients normally we're treating ear infections and but I literally several times a week I have people crying in my office and why I think I think the point though also needs to be made for the audience because you you and I are the only doctors at the table Yeah we we never you're an ENT she normally doesn't get involved anywhere close to the issue and guess what she is kneed deep in this right so so Mary I know we're like almost an hour into this podcast but let's give you like a brief introduction like your background right so I I went to Stanford I'm an ENT um and I kind of stumbled P into I had patients coming to me because no one else would treat him and I'm an expert in respiratory diseases so it makes sense and because I didn't shut my doors people started coming to me and initially I used well I tried hydroxy chloroquin but as soon as president Trump mentioned it as an option it got shut down and literally the Texas State Board of Pharmacy sent out a letter prohibiting us from prescribing it so then I moved on to monoclonal antibodies and those worked great people turned around very quickly and I get unlimited Supply well then the government shut that down and that was right around when Biden mandated the co shots they shut down monoclonal antibodies it was all it was an orchestrated effort and so I started using Ivermectin and I found that Ivermectin worked I was a little nervous that it wouldn't because monoclonal antibodies worked so well uh but what I did find I found it it worked and so I treated over 6,000 Co patients when you see that high volume I mean that's something I'll never again experience in my career I mean usually I see a wide variety of issues as an ENT never had such a large volume of the same disease in such a short period of time and you become an expert in it and you know I started speaking out and of course I got I got ridiculed smeared cancelled I'm still fighting for my medical license so I put everything on the line to tell the truth and I think that brings us to another point is that you know all these people all these doctors who have really stuck their necks out have suffered because of you know just telling the truth I mean just upholding the hypocritic oath are being completely ignored especially right now right now let's let's flip the switch though Mary because I want you to talk about this you and Casey have the exact same training right she dropped out of her residency sister and I reached out to her several times she dropped out of her residency so she had no way to actually have her door doors open to actually see the things that you saw well and maybe you know I I understand if you are not in my position you it is not as imperative to you as somebody who's seen the same thing over and over and over again seeing people crying in their in your office over and over again do you think that may have something to do with why she wrote a book about food Jack not food Jack Jack Jack hold on it's not about actually talking to her I don't want to assume nefarious motives on her part are you but I do find it it's it's interest it's just it's just interesting and um what's interesting that I mean we've gone over this that first time author First Time author that doesn't finish her residency that doesn't have a medical license finishing the resc she never finished her residency I know but but that's part of the book I know but what does that matter if it's part of the book but what's your point what because she can't see patience have you ever read her levels corporate agreement yeah you're to people about that that are mistaken um actually I read it yeah yeah they don't they don't guess what yeah she can't see patients Callie do you do you know that she doesn't even have a medical license in the United States why are you like do you know that yes yes she left the medical system Jack that's interesting so hold on so do you know a guy named Tim noes no Tim NOS is a doctor that faced a multi-million dollar lawsuit because patients thought he was practicing outside of his specialty on the internet cost him almost $2 million so I've heard your sister multiple times in multiple places with you MH and many of the things that she's saying with no medical malpractice no medical license didn't finish her ENT residency I got to be honest with you maybe that's the reason why she doesn't have the same experience that Mary has yeah so okay I I want to I'll respond but but should I well I'm I'm just you know like I said I don't assume nefarious motives because she's not speaking out about but what the in the world nowly Jack that's why I'm here honestly and I think that's valid honestly well yeah when you've gone through what I've gone you don't trust anybody I think I think you're I think you've got a think but I I I am here we talked about this I you know I didn't see all your I consider conspiratorial stuff I think this idea that you don't have trust is super valid not just of us of just general I think this is a I think this is a very high Stakes time and there's a lot of people listening that have it's not about me or it's like like I think this actually it is about you too hold on hold on but there's also a lot of just distress in general I think around the system like I think you're bringing the trust to this magical moment but that get I want to finish what we the whole thing I never got to finish the whole trust thing right because that's that's the biggest problem I see I have patients coming to me I have a a list a printed list of doctors that I give them okay these are the people that are like-minded these are the people that you know will never make you wear a mask in the office will'll never ask you your vaccination status have you know been very like-minded and if the government does not take this this opportunity to come down and and hold people accountable we will never restore the trust at least In Our Lifetime and that people need to have the everything T taken down and we need immediate and Swift action or the TR I mean we'll never restore the trust I mean I'm telling you okay look how many you know how many people are still getting these shots I mean it's probably less than 10% and that's a reflection of their trust in our government because our government is telling them that they need to get these I think it's like 3% for like young kids it's like when it's the yeah it's good well good I mean nobody should be getting these shots nobody and um yeah so if we if we don't do something it we're never going to restore the trust and this is the time to do it and and soft pedaling this is just is just not going to work I mean people are do not trust our health system and and it I think that's why this conversation is so important and I also think that that's why it's admirable that CI suggested we actually do this and he come here and talk to you guys if he was some sort of Nefarious Trojan Horse I don't think he would have done that okay but I want to emphasize that he is he's has a big role you have a big microphone right now you are all over the news you're you're bipartisan news you're all over the news right now you have the ear of trump and Kennedy and and we need to convince you that that no child should be given the option of getting this modified synthetic mRNA shot that that has dire consequences if it goes wrong and it doesn't go wrong in everybody we know that but there's different they're varying degrees varying numbers 4% 15% one in 500 one in 800 serious adverse reaction you should see the patients in my office that come to see me with these injuries that they're they're it is it is lifechanging and there's nothing we can do for these people it's very hard they don't get better and what what kind of people are they what age group and and what speci I have young people I have older people um but it it's so a lot of it's neurological which is very difficult to to fix um I don't see the myocarditis a stroke that sort of thing because I'm outpatient but I see these people with a really chronic debilitating health problems I looked at my new patient appointments and the two years following the roll out of shots 7% of my new patients were coming to see me for injuries directly related to these shots they typically get the million-dollar workup they see a bunch of other doctors they're never reported a vars none of the patients that came to see me were reported a vars even though the onset of symptoms was in close proximity and that's the other thing ver is 1% 1% it's only a reflection of 1% and um now I've lost my drain of fat uh well but oh the injuries yeah so neurological um I see uh pots which is where the blood pressure just fluctuates up and down erratically with no trigger fig and that's very difficult to treat isal orthostatic hypertension it's caused by mitochondrial damage to cytochrome one in the mitochondria um yeah so and these people there's just not a lot we can do for them right and there's they they you know I would say a lot of people slowly get better um but you know I have one patient with severe vertigo just won't go away young guy 10 years younger than me otherwise healthy just now completely debilitated can barely walk uh I have another patient with severe Tremors I mean he's a CEO of a company uh maybe 5 years older than me otherwise was previously healthy now just can't stop shaking all the time all the time um another patient with severe unexplained pain in her flank that you know she's had all these Imaging studies nothing shows up she's previously healthy and just now she's just debilitated by this un explain pain so let me tell you what I did I was retired I was a a [[Bitcoin]] m and I got asked to do a I guess you would call it a a movie with Mulla and Malone and it was so controversial that it had to be behind a pay wall and my part of the movie was kind of interesting I reviewed the patents on the Jabs before they came out and I was the first one to notice that there was two legal definitions and that's all I talked about as a doctor you know what I did then Mary I went back to work went back to the ICU started going back two times every month and I started seeing on average 13 people with clots people dying a week yeah and then something very interesting happened that I really want to get into started to see people from youngest was 17 oldest was 94 that would present with no history of cancer and then they had stage four cancer M Callie when your mom got cancer can ask a little Kinder when you talk about like I'll I'll be kind but you know your mom did die during right didn't she yeah she didn't get the okay let me ask you a question have you ever looked at her death certificate okay so so so have you ever looked at her death certificate Jack Jack Jack I'm just asking you a question Jack Jack have you ever looked at the desic Jack it's a yes or no question Jack if you're going to talk about personal stuff you want to call your sister up and ask her she looked at hold on hold on BR bring a little more heart to this Jack oh this is this is where the heart of the matter is my friend Jack Jack Jack can can you take a can we take a breath and can you just like I need an answer why are you being so angry about my mom's death because I think you're full of [ __ ] you think I just told you there's no trust you I'm full of [ __ ] about my mom's death yeah I think it's it was a ruse I don't think your mom's story why you wrote that book is actually what you're telling everybody and I want everybody to hear it straight from your mouth that you're not lying to us because I'm going to tell you something when you take a look at her death certificate you might I want to make sure that you're you're really understand where I'm going your mom lived in California when was the first person that got a job you know December 10th mhm okay your mom died in January right Casey is on record in podcast saying that your mother got diagnosed and died in 13 days from a stage 4 cancer you have been on Tucker Carlson you have been on Joe Rogan right and you've told the world because your mother had a metabolic disease that she died is that factually correct that she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and died 13 days later and it was a stage four yes she was previously perfectly fine correct correct correct Jack you want me to pull the picture from 2014 that shows you she was pretty good Jack it's a yes or no question brother Jack answer the question Jack stop no I'm not going to jack answer the question Jack I'm answering the question all right he's gonna answer now she was feeling a little sluggish in the months before but the pancreatic cancer diagnosis was a huge surprise okay so let me ask you a question where does she live half May California all right so what do you know about in California in December of 2020 and and January of 21 anything a little bit unusual that you recall because remember you this was your seminal event that you and your sister changed your life to write the book yeah right yes that 13 days because I've heard your sister and you say that so I'm taking you I believe you mhm so I want to talk about that issue well are I seem to be Shing you we're making that up I didn't say that yet you just did no I didn't you did I didn't but but um but I'd like to ask you a question I'd like to ask you a question let me answer the question she was so yes she was diagnosed and then there was 13 days that were very important to me and Casey right what's your question my question is have you looked at her death certificate I I have not seen her death she died of pancreatic cancer okay has your sister looked at the death certificate what are you getting at I have not seen the death certificate I think he needs to look at it you know that all death certificates in California are a public record right sure you might want to take a look at that before you do your next podcast how is that Jack because maybe your mother didn't die of a metabolic condition pancreatic cancer no what did you why why did why do you assume that pancreatic cancer is only a metabolic condition I think cancer is highly tied to metabolic Health yeah yes did you have uh [[Kevin McKernan]] in here a couple weeks ago what did he tell you about sv40 and all that yeah well Kevin is that a metabolic condition well it impacts the cells I mean I mean I I think I think overp remember you're not a doctor I know I think overprescription of pharmaceuticals are causing a lot of issues to our metabolic Health but you just told us that your mom didn't take the job so she couldn't have been overprescribed could she she didn't get the job no but when was she born 40 something 49 46 46 yeah yeah she got the folio jab did you know that so you're saying it could have something to do with a a jab that she got decades ago maybe and maybe did let me ask you a question because you're a great lobbyist okay why do you know that do you know that sv40 is associated with rapid presentation of stage four pancreatic cancer did you know that yes or no Jack yes or no remember going do this ignorance or fraud bro I'm not going to do this where we at this is all right we have to let's try Jack let's just let's try to be a little let's try to be a little bit more reasonable just talking to each other and I think this is pretty reasonable Jack no Jack um what's your question did uh did I know hold on hold on so I am not aware of her getting any vaccines in a recent period to the cancer um I assume she was you know as we talk about she was a product of the modern medical system and I think got probably all the vacines that she was supposed to get I think that's reasonable over her life nobody would argue with you about at all hold on hold on so so so and then and then my story we can I mean I find this for fully good faith I mean we could talk about what you think happened but my story that was implanted on my mom is she was a product of modern medical advice um you know she ate ultra-processed food and lowfat diet um she probably had some tough things going on with her light and circadian rhythm and sleep disregulation you know she she um she uh was working to be active but was was somewhat sedentary um you know probably was over relying on Pharmaceuticals I don't know her whole vaccine history she didn't get the C jab that wasn't available and you know she was on other medications as we talked about just just so you're clear it was available in California when your mom was there 271,000 people in California got the jab do you know you know the number you January do you know do you know the number one place oh my God okay where the are you suggesting my mom got the Cod Callie are is that what you're saying did I say that can I ask the question before before you try to answer for you make a lot of suggestions what are you saying I'm saying to you you're suggesting do you know the reason why California got the jab early no because there was many people from China that was over there okay so the jab was given specifically at two major places do you know where those places were probably Stanford oh okay and where else in Los Angeles good right okay can I can I okay good um so my story is that she had a multifactorial issues that are actually hard to pin down of modern society that are attacking her overall mitochondri metabolic Health um I think that pancreatic cancer and many forms of cancer are highly tied to our cellular regulation and not tied to the absence of some cancer therapy but a multifactorial complex uh group of factors let me ask you a question do you think it's normal I'm I'm going to let you I'm going to let you keep going on but you have to remember something you're not a doctor I am Jack Jack I'm saying what what I'm saying is do you think it's normal for a 71y old woman yeah to show up with a stage ptic cancer we know [Music] how hold on um I think it's becoming more common so I think pancreatic cancer generally is very deadly because you tell me if this doesn't jve with what your experience is is that the stage four sneaks up on you very quickly and it does lay dormant for a long time and then it's known as soon that appears and then you're out pretty quickly so I do think that actual it was was pretty quick but I think that pancreatic cancer is particularly tough with that because you you you basically start learning about it when it's very late of in stage four so I think that actually is pretty common and my understanding Jack is that pancreatic cancer rates um you know 50 years ago was not really something you ever saw some with pancreatic cancer and they are like many forms of cancer are increasing a lot so while it's rare I don't know I'm meeting a lot of people whose parents have died very quickly from pancreatic cancer I think it is increasing in rate actually the highest uh place in the United States you know where it is California there you go so let's that's directly related to let's talk about that okay so you know that your sister used to have a previous history with 23 and me so so so no I don't so let me let me let me talk about that no no no hold on let me talk about that Casey interned for 23 and me as a freshman or sophomore College 16 years ago she she didn't interact with she's called her a wonderful friend hold on I can give you the facts you can dispute them or whatever you want um in the past 16 years she's seen an wji or whatever her name is one time where they were on a panel to uh they were on a panel together the top health conference where Casey eviscerated the pharmaceutical industry to gas from the crowd very adversarial um and one of them post a picture referring to old friends as a as an old intern she's seen an one time in 16 years has never met Sergey and those are the facts so you can call that alive she did when she posted on Instagram she said wonderful friend I mean that was a reference to them being an intern like she she does not know she has seen an exactly once has interacted with her exactly once in 16 years when that photo was taken Callie do you know uh who's and sister the Susan Susan yeah I don't know her you don't do you know anything about her I know she died of cancer right yeah she was the CEO of YouTube yeah you know the one that pulled Kevin off for sv40 I I don't know anything more than that do you know that she had an adoc carcinoma no I have no idea who like you know hold on hold on hold on hold on let me let me go so what do you know about anoc carcinoma very little It's associated with cigarette smoking would you my mom smoked would you be surprised back in the day would you be surprised to know that Susan with jicky didn't smoke my mom my mom did smoke she stopped about yearsing about stop being so menacing man I'm asking about you have Hate in Your Heart about this for some reason I don't know we'll have to look into your motivations but um you should have before you came I I know that man I actually had of respect for other people I don't want to get into them but um yeah what okay so what what the deal with Susan Susan died of aggressive cancer as well I heard that right you know that her son also died four months before her I don't know that well he did he killed himself same cocktail of drugs that most of the shooters have what was that cocktail uh you Steve can look it up it's an SFGate I'm not going to go through all the drugs it's really not important for the story okay so the interesting thing is Susan and your mom both lived in California yeah do you know that I couldn't find Susan's death certificate anywhere okay but I could find your mom's okay what do you think I would assume that's because Susan is a prominent person and they might have covered it up or something it's the law Cali you remember you did intern at the White House and you were lobbyist and you know that the law applies to everybody except Hunter B that's right but but okay so let me ask you a question yes this is big Tech these guys are linked to the people youed to work for and magically the death certificate's not there so you know levels was paid for in a deck from a16z so so so so hold on hold on so Andries and Horwitz is the largest vental Capital firm in the country correct and um after my sister left the medical system she had a thesis that a lot of our conditions that are treated in silos you guys probably agree with this right we treat things in silos we have you know endocrinologists for diabetes and ent's for head and neck you know sintis it's you know they're all these things are interconnected so one small way to attack that not everything but one small way she thought is to give people continuous glucose monitors it's changed my life it like it's a closed loop of what what I'm eating it's you know a couple hundred thousand people have gotten them they don't share or um or sell date in any way I think as you suggested and they raised money from andr Horowitz which I have not raised money from um thise I haven't found anything conspiracy is uh I I i' happily do it I mean you know this conspiracy is is new to me because because uh they turned us down but um so let let's talk about what where you think I'm going because I'm not going there you go so your sister likes to use continuous blood glucose monitors in her book The One that you co-wrote with her so I'm assuming that you edited with her what was the number one technology use for people with poor sleep do you recall that we recommended yeah a sleep monitor Fitbit wasn't it we Rec we we we didn't try not to recommend too many brand names but we what what what does a Fitbit do it measures your um it messes various metrics around your sleep and heart HRV that kind hold on a minute yeah does does it use non-native [[Non-Native Electromagnetic Fields|EMF]] so let me answer that my understanding is Fitbit has lower EMF and scores lower on that but but does it use it uh I I I honestly I'd love to learn I mean I think I learn about every single thing that uses EMF raises blood glucose and Insulin I think that's may be true so guess what what you wrote the book in the middle of it mhm and you told everybody it's the best way to do it I I think I think trackers and understanding more when did you write the book though when did you write the book hold on hold on hold on the book came out in what 23 let's have a conversation but the book came out in 2223 I wrot the book 20 yeah yeah it's when did you start writing it 2021 22 22 202 beginning of Co right after your mom God say yeah you started thinking about it yeah okay do you know the paper for Nora voal that when it came out that anything that is associated with non-native EMF I I listen I think EMF is a huge problem but do you know when the paper came out no do you think your sister does I don't know was in 2011 okay so you're saying people shouldn't wear fitbits no what I'm saying is when you tell people that these are things related to a metabolic disease and then you're using non-native EMF to track it because guess what chronic glucose monitors also do this what is the what is the kind of Point here because I'm I'm C certainly open to that information and we could correct the book I do think bow wearables are useful in understanding more data about your body but yeah I don't think they are at all okay okay I I think honestly that's a pretty small part of our whole message but but sure I I I think that in the ne my personal opinion is in the next 10 years uh more personalized understanding what's happening in our body can supplant the doctor kind of uh construct that's totally failed I think we have these discussions on what's more important the pharmaceutic I the light the food I think they're all I I think it's kind of dumb to stack rank them honestly I think everyone should have an understanding of their biomarkers would we agree that our glucose our fast and glucose our HDL our triglycerides our blood pressure okay I wouldn't I I'm you're talking to the wrong guy about that no I I actually how would you measure success like from an internal like personalized perspective how would you measure success heter plasi that's the only way and and the reason why I bring this up to you and this this is where me not being adversary with you I find it very interesting that both you and your sister were caught with your pants down in 13 days about your mom but never realized pants down meaning that you were you were not ready for what happened right but immediately you went to blame the food no we didn't blame the food issues well I mean Jack Jack Jack Jack we are on the scene and this is your question why are we here the tuer Carlson podcast is the most shared podcast this year okay people listened to the podcast and shared it okay that is that is why we're here and my advice my PR advice is I think that's because case's talking from the heart and it connected with people okay that is the truth all this conspiracy stuff I got to know Bobby I met him a couple times and I picked up the phone from the heart I've talked to Trump folks a couple times and I from the heart feeling very emotional after the butler shooting I said there's a generational opportunity for Unity maybe you should call Trump and I I can try to help that make that happen these are all like just personal from the heart things and you guys can either believe that or not I think that Casey's putting out a lot of light and I'm certainly trying to do that connected with people and the book the book is not about Froot Loops Jack do it's not do you see my point though that you know we've we've been fighting a war for four years absolutely all of a sudden no one's talking about it anymore and we're all talking about seed oils just hold on hold on hold on hold on it's called the hegan dialect dude dude dude and the place that you used to work specialized you know what you know what also is a tactic to throw around [ __ ] to cause doubt on people and like say that that's why we're here for you bullsh I am not here for you I'm here because there's a lot of people listening it's not about me that that are skeptical of this I think we have a generation opportunity I have a lot of respect for you I think you are seeing a lot of pain Jack I think your thoughts um on the science are are often very brilliant and you know I don't really have any debate for them other than the stack ranking I mean you know listening to hours of your stuff I just think it's like you know completely dismissing food I mean maybe it's stack it is well there's no question about it I'll agree with you 100% that that di missing food is a five or six on the list well that might be I I I I I think when we start pinning down and try notice how I said the stuff that you and your sister are talking about I'm I'm actually okay with that I have zero issues I ask you what where where's where's the what's the result of what we're trying to do then if we're connected with Rockefeller and trying to subvert this agenda and bring the what are what are we like how have we why would I not focusing on the right things light technology the Jabs but why do you think he's trying to take the eye off the ball yes well is this is not not why would why would I then work just to bring these issues so much into the why would why would cast on the broken leg in other words you're going to limit what Bobby can do in government nobody's limiting what Bobby can do well there's you and a lot of people that are around these globalist entities that are being placed in the cabinet right now I'm not going there's a lot of of of we know that if the shots get pulled off the market a whole industry of Biotech is going to go down it's it's a big deal right so the people with the vested interest in mRNA are going to use every tactic they can to keep it alive and so that's why we're suspicious we're sus and maybe you're an unwitting uh agent maybe maybe they're using you you have no idea maybe but uh we we just there's a there's a technique called misdirection it's a war it's a war technique and it just kind of all falls but but but but but gaming this out so so we write a book of this in the pharmaceutical industry we go on podcast of history in the pharmaceutical industry I think you're giving me way too much credit but I do whatever I help to put these ideas to help did the pharmaceutical uh industry distribute the job no Department of Defense did so who is the pharmaceutical industry in this story they were just the drug dealers but Jack I'm just saying I'm just trying to game out your your argument is so so I my argument is I want you to actually make an accurate diagnosis in fact I'm not holding your fee to the fire really as bad as I hold your sister's fee to the fire well well my sister my sister as you might know is you know I think said stuff from the heart that's impacted people and is not you know as much in the day-to-day of this political thing I'm very passionate Jack about figuring out how to create and think about policies that accomplish goals that I I'm pretty sure that we're all aligned with in the most fast and radical way um again I strongly believe that that is when it comes to pharmaceutical products um having an emphasis the next six months on a radical transparency agenda I I do think that is and see I disagree with you on that and but I've made that case I've already made the case I've actually done something that you haven't done well Jack I'm working in the I'm working too to to do stuff we both are and I no not working on on the same goals my goal is to eradicate what that eradicate what all the VAC my goal is to eradicate chronic disease why do you think nobody has been appointed that has been outspoken about taking the shots off the market so nobody has gotten a position do you think it's the best idea just to ban them or do you think it's the the best IDE Mna platform needs to be banned the otheres I'm okay with the transparency and disc they want to save face they could just say hey we're going to we're going to pull it off the market while we do further studies that would be a very easy way to save face and not do do you want to chat I mean I'm not trying to be like I you were giving me way too much credit but like like let's figure out the best strategy to get your research out there and get a path to what you think could happen I mean I mean there are like like like like like I feel like I my my story is that actually talking about any type of strategy you feel is not this is my story I'm not saying it you is is like not um is almost like suspicious if if you're talking about any type of like like as a as a as a definitive statement no I do not think the platform of everyone in government right now to immediately pull everything I do not think that's the appropriate um political feasibility about politics it's about health no no no no getting getting something done in this generational moment is about politics I have to say Mary it is yeah I I disagree with that too just I just that's I wrote a constitutional amendment Jack Jack Jack we're on we're on like like I think the fact that I mean honestly my my main issue is like we're kind of thinking about maybe even different like like I think it's perfectly appropriate to ask and this is frankly not where Casey's thinking Casey's thinking about more of a spiritual level like I'm thinking more about like what could be done in the next year and you know that's different than like what the moral imperative is I'm tell I feel a ton I know you see the kids and people every day and that's harrowing like I feel like I have a pretty deep you know concern for what's happening to America's children and like what's happening to America I think we're we're being slaughtered right now and like I I I think I think what I am where my brain goes is like how to translate that into into policy now there could be big disagreements with that and there should be massive like outside agitation and challenging on everything but like the uh the immediate going to like that we're working with Rockefeller and like you know well no the point that I try to make to you earlier and I don't think you've done a good job but okay the cool thing is the audience will decide this where are you ignorance well you think I'm ignorant well I do and I think your sister's more ignorant than you are we might be unwittingly uh but my concern coming in here is that there's a line between ignorance and fraud and what I'm trying to do what are we frauding I think you could be a front for the globalist the big Tech Guys then why would we why would our Central message be eviscerating the pharmaceutical because you want to get into the administration so that you can hamper things that's what fabians do the fabians are the ones behind the Council of why would I have just tried to like not have this message get on the center like why wouldn't I just like I just told you the reason why because people like me are blocking you from doing it yeah well that's the truth that is absolutely the truth what do you mean by that just what I said I've told the right people that they need to be concerned about you two until you come on a podcast and to your credit I'll be the first one to give you this credit Danny told me that you backed out until 25 and then you said no with Jack saying let's do this now until what next year right let's talk about this now because you know what I talking about when we originally had a podcast scheduled and then you had to reschedule it till 2025 and now you're back in you said let's let's talk that's great I'm glad that we're here talking about because to be honest with you I'm giving you the Olive Branch I want you to actually set the record straight cuz the audience I can tell you right now this is going to be a very simple litmus test is it ignorant or is it fraud which one are people going to go and you know there's going to be people that make comments Afters just the way we look at each other the way we talk to each other the the issues that have been presented and I do really want to hear go ahead what do you want from you because there's things about your family what concerned you about my family the books your dad's written these are these are really concerning we know that what his history let's go through this quick let's go through this well no you this is what I'm trying to say you will not let me finish any points here well the bottom line is your family is painted with a globalist brush there's not even a question no no no by their actions no no no no no by by by by Jack the I think we're spending hold on I think the book your father wrote is directly tied to Richard okay who you used to work for his wife is a Dei leader in the world economic Forum okay okay can I can I so so um I think we're probably spending too much time on me but take it wherever you want um Jack we just need you to answer the question Ja Jack that's all we need to do and you're not doing a good job of it thank you for that analysis can what what's the question Callie I think um your non-answer is an answer hold on whoa whoa specifically what was the question Jack Jack what is the question question is is it ignorance or is it fraud okay um why would you laugh at because because I think a very uncomfortable laugh my friend okay because I think I think um I haven't laughed too much during this podcast I've been looking directly at you looking to see your answer and it really bothers me that this is difficult for you I I bet you if I ask you the question if we could ban high fructose corn syrup you'd have no problem saying absolutely not absolutely not I don't think we should ban High food disc corn syrup it's the exact same answer I'd give on the co I think we need m transparency never I would agree with you in the sense that and jack hold on Jack um no I would not say we should ban High F those current Ser I don't think Bans are politically a good thing to do I think transparency is so I would absolutely not say to corruption out of the social media platforms like YouTube and Twitter and all of these social media platforms that are basically monopolies that control all information in the world and making it so they cannot be infiltrated by government agencies or big Pharma how about how about the Rockefeller Foundation or the people that are behind all these PR firms cuz that's who's doing all this stuff I'm talking about the conversation specifically like conversations like we have with Kevin M where they get taken so when you have somebody who's questioning these things there is a policy called the medical misinformation policy on YouTube which we I'll make it very clear up front when we before we release this podcast I'll put a little Stinger up there that says that we're clearly not doing that here none of this is medical information but there are policies that are written in there that are very loose Go YouTube there's nothing except for literally one minute clips from like news stations talking about how she got beat by uh the the Methodist Hospital okay we've got a lot going around here let me let me try to and then um Jack uh no I'm I'm I'm laughing because the idea of my dad's book Felix the flamingo which is a book that sold 50 copies that he wrote for a dear friend of the families who um contemplated suicide after being in the closet uh as a gay man for a long time um and he wrote a book about acceptance and it's a it's a magical Flamingo who uh is different it's a book about a gay Flamingo I read it yeah it's a book it's a book about a flamingo that's different it's it has nothing to do with trans and um has a lot to do though with the Globus about with what with the Globus that are in control the who the globalists the globalists correct the Rockefellers Jack he hired Jack Jack he hired a um illustrator on upwork and worked for a month as a side project on a book as a tribute to a good friend who was closeted and gay right which fits the ideology of the [[Council of Foreign Relations]] which your dad was also a member he was not a member he got he has never m in any way sh perform of the council for relations I don't know if that's so true my friends he actually when when uh a family friend put me on it uh is just uh on that list a couple years ago I think before that happened by the way how did they put you on the list Chelsea gabberts in the account this is a massive like prestigious thing I I I think it's very is it really prestigious no I think it's actually terrible I I I actually no Jack like this is this is my this is me like this is what I bring to this I racked up these plots like that was my like um that was my issue in were you to climb the ladder yeah so that's what you're saying absolutely so because you use that you thought that you could get points in DC so can I ask you a question I accept that I accept that I accept that 100% toally so let me ask you a question this gets to really the hard of the matter tell me about a place where you want to climb the ladder with that kind of stuff being an Accolade like would would would you and I put that as an Accolade to climb up the ladder of medicine I I don't consider CFR an Accolade I I think you're digging into any you've dug in and seemed like higher investigators and you've found Felix the flamingo the fact that I've been to one CFR meeting and then trying to slam me on the fact that I used to work for lobbying a public affairs firms which is Central to my message those are the three things you found after I know and I know something about you jack spending a lot of energy not with the goal of getting to truth but the goal of um criticizing us so no actually I'm actually I'm here to try to get to the truth find out where we are the three just to three things you have is that the that that my dad wrote a children's book that I went to one Council on forign relations meeting which is Central to my story about trying to rack up these things and you worked for an MK Ultra sponsored yeah but he didn't know that did you how could I not know that as a 23-year-old what are you talking about yeah I mean you never you never looked up the name of guy on on that you worked for it's possible he didn't know the guy work I don't know I I actually don't know what still I've listen to your stuff on this Jack like so you don't know who you don't know who Daniel edman is in the beginning of this podcast you just mentioned that you did of course I know who he is and you knew his son so you don't see that that ideology is the same ideology Daniel utman died Richard utman 2013 yeah yeah yeah and then the sun took over yeah he he was the ideology of both of these people are very similar to what's in your dad's book in fact Richard's new wife Richard's new wife is the Dei expert for the we God so so Jack just to just to tease out what you're saying if you could listen to me in good faith my story is attacking this DC tactics of kind of what you're describing in cultra like like that's what we did with food and pharmaceuticals and cigarettes like like like calling those out that's why I came on the scene two years ago I started talking about how we used to pay the NAACP to say that coke was basically fine and racist to ban it on food stamps it's like that those tactics are very dark and but you know those weren't the tactics of MK Ultra right you know what the tactics were right you said you listened to the podcast and I did yeah yeah War my control light light non vmf stuff that's in your I don't know stuff that's in your so if Richard was part of Mind Control hold on if Richard was part of a mind control that that's news to me and like maybe I I didn't know about that um but so let me just let me just so I I work for these companies and um what are the other ones the CFR I mean that's who I not so much the CFR my my real concern yeah but my real concern and I think you've really you've tried to dance around this fact what's the direct question I'm happy to address the agent for your book is a okay it's a we person so it seems WF DAV person so guess what these are the people you're running away from but that's the agent selling your book and then you use non-native EMF fitbits and chronic glucose monitors that's what I'm hearing I think that they I think they did Rick rubin's book Ang well no they didn't well he had a he had a top agent too that we T listen this is let me just this Rick is gonna have a top agent but not a top we no no no it's not if you Google top healthc care book agents this these guys I agree keep going all of them are tied to agenda 2030 okay so are you ignorant of that fact or is it fraudulent how did you find your agent yeah okay let's talk about it great well the world economic form called me and said we want you to write a book about how the pharmaceutical industry and the global is evil and then they connected me to their special agent and then this is the key part they put a g to a million Americans heads to buy the book in the past six months and they made everyone listen to my sister my podcast and connect from the heart they did a mind control experiment they they did a mind control experiment your previous friends in history had no help in propping you up so you're you don't believe that's the case no no I tweeted something in tuckle Carlson's producer DM me do you want to see it no I don't I don't need to why because I think the audience is going to listen to this podcast and draw their own conclusions and what would that conclusion be in your opin we're gonna find out so what but what but Jack what's your conclusion I think do you think I'm working with the world economic form on my book no I actually think you are a little bit nefarious and you're not trustworthy so what's I I thought coming in here that you would State the case cuz you're pretty eloquent speaker you've not been eloquent today at all okay and I thought ignorance was a fair game mhm but the more you've talked today the more I feel like there is actually something there now do I know what the something is I don't but I I would say to you and I think you could discuss this both with Mary and your sister in medicine when you're not sure about something we have something called the precaution principle meaning we should be careful so think anybody who listens to this podcast that's in Washington DC should know who you are and be careful with you before they put you on another podcast before they give you a platform before they stick a microphone in your face that's all I'm saying okay well that that's that's what you thought you could be a great guy you could be a great guy that's what you thought before and I knew you were coming in with bad faith but but I I want the people decide I agree with that so um let's I I'll I'll happily answer anything um but on the agent front um when you so I spent a year writing the book then we asked various friends in the Health Community to introduce us to various agents we spoke to five different agents through connections of Health folks that we all know those are who made the introductions we have a fantastic agent who has done books from all different ideological perspectives um I don't even know this world economic form I I don't do not think Richard did Carl or Schwab's book um the the the actually did who's the name of this guy we can have Steve look the agency people can people can the agency's ink well it's one of the largest the largest the point that Callie's making is a good point because most of the diet books that are out there actually do have ties back to the same group of people and this is the same thing let's goes on with media this isn't not something that is is linked so much to Cali and Casey this is actually a a real problem that I have with all authors with those books well well Jack let me let me let me let me give you behind the scenes from how I we got an agent he then brought it to Market we got various offers we went with penguin and then we wrote the book and had very little um oversight on it I'd say like overall from the publishing you know it's a little bit it's a little bit woke um and we had some back and forth with people I think think none of that none of that do I I have a a real big problem with I just think that that that kind of stuff needs to be talked about I think people are skep the big issue I have with it is the fact that it was a Adam Grant you know S no go up go up these the Brian cranon I mean I don't know I mean these are just like whatever so Jack people can their own de but like like this is like the cirle like we like Jack this is what I'm trying to get from you and like you know people could be skeptical you're right I mean like everyone should be skeptical to everyone I you got to question everything these days that's the point that Mary and I are trying to bring up that's why I'm here and to me I think that's fair applaud you for coming to do this yeah and and Jack okay I'm trying to talk from the heart here like um I do feel uncomfortable talking about myself like I don't usually so I might be more in articulate like I think it's not even worth people's time I think there is this larger issue in this moment of like trust and I think that's important I think what you said it's like you should have a bad feeling about everyone I mean okay I think I think you're being a little bit like on a on a Jihad here but um um you're right I am my goal is to take apart centralized medicine but not not not way you're doing it but my My Own Way well I I might ask you to like I mean listen I I I don't I I get in huge arguments I've had huge huge public issues with people from traditional medicine I don't think we should be building consensus necessarily right now I don't think you have any obligation to like me or work with me at all like like consensus is pseudo scientif I agree I agree I agree with that I I don't think this is a time where we should be building consensus and like War the necessarily the goal is for us to like I think that's the point that Mary's been trying to get you to realize when you talk to her on the phone those two times and you guys got into a heated discussion you have to realize what what this lady has been through I agree is horrible I haven't been through what she went through well well I they're going after they're going after her livelihood and putting her in Deb hold on let let me let me finish this and um just just if we're going through the stories here um we got an agent got a publisher wrote the book we have no PR whatsoever um the Tucker Carlson episode really resonated I believe from my sister's heart I've been on some other podcasts this whole political thing think you're getting some misinformation on some of that I have tried the best I possibly can to have good energy and a good heart with this and work to bring people together to communicate this idea and I've been a small player in that there's many other people we know who've been Warriors in that and I think you in many ways have been a warrior in that and I think there's a mass Consciousness a mass Awakening um so so that's where my heart is and then I think on the distracting of the message um I I you know I just I just would like tease that out the logic is I I aggressively I aggressively like want to like my hope is that we have decentralized medicine is that we have a true paradigm shift and how medicine is looked at of a more interconnected you know um root causes that we incentivized that we have full transparent science that we um that we um you know you know my my company you know the flexibility hsas I I think I think it would be amazing if people had uh control over their Healthcare dollars could read your stuff and actually instead of getting drugged you know could look at light therapy or red lights or whatever other type of modalities you recommend like like like I think everyone should be on a journey like you guys have been on and I think we should have you know no mandates and and and I think even just as bad as mandates as our standard of care in Medicare Medicaid where it's the AMA top down basically you're getting a pill uh if you're sick like like we don't have any curiosity that we engender for people so so those are the main principles that I try to talk about and um and and really fully believe in um and um you know I that that's who I am I I I I don't I don't I don't even know what i' how I'd be kind of my whole thing with your stuff it's like what what what is my goal in your head like I I think goal I think your goal and and I think this is the point that I I really do think you're missing okay is that you have wanted to climb in the swamp from being a little boy and you've done a pretty good job I will tell you that that I I think you have done a really good job so you have to realize when I see a young man M who's trained to two institutions that I absolutely hate which which is fair and then meteoric rise and then just so you know I turn down Tucker Carlson because he's part of the problem okay I would never go on Joe Rogan for the same reason because he's also tied to the global Elites how was Rogan tied to the global we'll talk about that later but the bottom line is I've been very public about both of those things when I did when I did the Rick Rubin podcast I didn't answer him for 6 weeks why cuz he wanted me to talk to to uberman and huberman's part of the SRI crew the SRI crew Stanford Research Institute that's who became MK Ultra after and then goes to the brain health initiative I don't expect you to know any of this CU you're not a doctor right I don't think that you're going to know these things but I believe the people that are steering where you're going and what you're doing and your message well nobody's stearing Jack like like I don't I actually think they I think there's a reason you're saying that I'm lying then no I'm not saying you're lying I'm actually giving you the benefit of the doubt right now Jack Jack Jack this is this then there might be mind control or we're puppets in a larger plan but but this is the truth my sister has great I think is the best communicator on these holistic Concepts that I've ever heard has deeply spiritually impacted me and we were deeply impacted by our mom's death without full answers but that there's this multifactorial thing and we started talking about that and then I think the energy as you've seen Jack like when you start saying truth Energy starts coming to you and then we've we've um gone on these podcasts and and I think connected with people from the heart so but you have to realize there's a reason that you haven't connected with me and Mary oh no no no you haven't hold on because it's not a food story no no no no Jack Jack Jack Jack story I I call Mary right away and I I I try to connect with everyone I think there's a very generally Jack I think this has been pretty positive I I do think generally most people even know a lot of people that follow you really feel like we're in a really interesting moment while there's still many Dark Forces that we can actually you know maybe change Consciousness in the country so I I I I don't you said that you would not ban anything the start well not necessarily anything but but but not high fructose corn syrup okay keny there there there's this that's fake we're that's F what's fake the high current sort band thing was going oh well wa no I'm not talking about that I'm talking about the the fact that Kennedy is or Trump is going to declare a state of emergency for for health right and here we go all over again what is going to be what are the proclamations going to be made in this emergency Declaration on chronic health so so so I am outside and I'm speaking for myself um there were a lot of ideas thrown out during the campaign I don't see a ton of appetite just and just my personal opinion is um era state of emergency using powers I think there is an emergency happening but I don't think that's like first on the agenda from my opinion um I think there is this tactical question which we could all talk about of what practically should be done in the next the first 100 days and I think that's a public conversation happening with everybody and I think I think I think that my opinion and this might sound woo woo but we need to change Consciousness about health in the country we need to be smart about doing big things not being incremental not finding consensus not trying to make friends with everybody but there are many people in the country that are starting to wake up more towards the world that you guys see and I think very interrelated to what I see and I do think Bobby's going to come and go Trump's going to come and go the biggest Victory we could possibly have is that the vast majority of Americans can't go back and see Health in a different way and I think that would be a huge win so I yeah I I I have I have some issues I I think we have we're in an emergency probably not an emergency order um if if you're asking where I think the prioritization should be I think really going hard at conflicts of interest and uh transparency would be two good places to start you've talked to Trump I take a lot so have you talked to Trump about the I I haven't I haven't talked to Trump a lot I I I've well how did you orchestr but you called them so so so so so so so and I've talked about this um the thing like the Tucker podcast and you guys have probably seen this people reach out Rick Rubin I don't you know Nicole like who're friends of there's a difference they're friends and patients of mine so there's a difference there okay well I I've I've made some good alliances with other I'm just saying people like the energy that you put out brings interesting people to you and like we have been like I've been connected to Trump advisers you know in the past year who I think really care about the chronic disease is and Trump talked about it very eloquently before the Bobby endorsement um and got to know Bobby um not that particularly well but but there's you know a Vibe here and I think a vibe that he led and and and communicated that was really optimistic and connected with a lot of people so what what's going on behind the scenes with is anybody talking about the shots behind theen I can tell you I can I can tell you exactly what's happening behind the scenes there's very little ideology and it is full on on discussions of the childhood chronic disease crisis and the fact that shots I think I think there's no he loves operation warp speed right Trump and all the advisers and everybody that he has put in in positions of power other than you know Jay bataria has said on X that he agrees that the shot should be pulled off the market because he signed the Hope Accord although the Hope Accord does not have it on their website but other than that everybody you know look at the General pick I mean that's a that's a nightmare I think there's a and Dr Oz is a complete nightmare I'm I'll just be the first one to say this yeah I love the Dr osben okay oh you do yeah because centralized medicine what better way to blow it up than to put a world economic form guy in charge of it okay um I I I I I think I think Dr o is gonna be extraordinary um you do I think wait why do you think it's possible that a lot of these people these highlevel people in politics and Bobby included from what you alluded to with your for your first conversation with Bobby and Rick that they aren't educated on any of this stuff and if they aren't educated on any of this stuff for examp there's no excuse at this point this is the biggest Public Health event in our lifetime you should be up to speed if especially if you're going to have power and a microphone totally you have to be you miss you miss something and while we were joking here I actually made a joke about Dr Oz and he actually thought it was a good pick and guess what that fits with okay my conern well well well well Jack I think that the picks Bobby made are are um I I think so the Bobby made these picks not Trump no no no I think the picks president Trump made yeah I think the the picks president Trump made are are very strong and I think I think you know this is just my opinion I think we have people that are aligned with the vision that Bobby and president Trump painted during the campaign and that's the reason why I said before that I'm I'm no longer on Bobby's train I'm I'm kind of out because of what Mary's saying here I had a lot of Hope and I will tell you that when Bobby got lawed Nicole got lawed um if you go back and listen to the Rick Rubin podcast Bobby laid his vision out right there about how he's going to do it because he's an attorney and I'm going to go Sue everybody like I've done before like we did with Monsanto right and the funny thing is I said to Bobby it's not going to work and I said I think you need to listen to what buelli did we need to put a constitutional amendment in and take all the criminals out of the mix to begin with and he said Jack that's great but not even Des santis could pass that that kind of law in Florida but then well I will say in Tennessee they're about to propose a bill to ban the sale and distribution of all mRNA tene may be the first well I I just got a call from one of the people a governor who this may be a very interesting point to bring up especially with him to show you just how what happened in Trump's last term could actually be helpful and this may be really big for you in Texas so you know that Trump took a lot of [ __ ] in his first term about abort abortion and remember since abortion is not mentioned in the Constitution the states have to go by the 10th Amendment well guess what medical freedom is also not mentioned in the Constitution that means it would go the same route so you know what that means Uncle Jack could sit down and talk to a governor if a governor is willing to put my constitutional amendment in the state constitution we got an issue and it's a good issue do I think that's a way to go because then you don't need to deal with Trump and you don't need to deal with Bobby Kennedy in other words you go straight be St well you have to realize the states that I think could be very very interesting here is Trump had a very contentious relationship with his previous primary guy our governor you know to santis and we know why that relationship was destroyed because somebody who used to work at Mercury which was a PR firm that's Susie Wilds where I used to work well Susie worked there as well and this was not about you this is more about her but you but you're missing the conspiracy tie yeah but you're not that important my friends I know that I why to I'm curious you're talking about so much you're not that important about this issue I agree the the issue is could this be an issue because your Governor actually is pretty decent well decent for the medical Freedom aspect you're roll your eyes why why is that Texas Texas is bad I mean we we are we have the largest Medical Center in the world we're home of the vacc Mandate Houston Methodist April 2021 we were the first one to do it and I mean even before the president mandated it yeah yeah four months before before Biden did it and you know we yeah you see what they did to me right I was nothing to them I mean I'm a solo practitioner pretty small practice and they like you know theyed me they squashed they tried to and um you know Abbot he was always sort of a step behind the santis during the pandemic I mean granted he was better than you know somebody in Washington state but he's always been a little bit cautious in the in medical freedom and uh you know I've reached out to him a lot regarding my case with the medical board and haven't heard anything back and I you know there's he has close ties to the medical community um so I don't I don't wait you were saying you like Abbot though and I can't remember I'm the reason I'm I'm I'm hedging my bets I can't say everything but there's states around Texas that I've already talked to and Texas knows about these is is progressing good I'm just gonna tell you I think I'm a little bit probably more optimistic on state than I am Federal yes I agree and the point that I'd make to you since you and I are flans you know I'm Congressional district one and you're down here mhm um very few people know that Matt gats is someone who represents me and I'm the reason why he kept going down to El Salvador because I kept writing him letters saying you need to come down and look at what plan buelli is and you know that I I feel very strongly about the Santas and I feel very strongly about the Florida Surgeon General that is the guy that should have got the job because if that guy gets the job the Jabs are over cuz they're B basically over here and you're a Floridian I'm a a Floridian when I'm in the states that is the kind of leadership that we need to see at the federal level not the state and the fact that we haven't got those picks in and we hear what Callie's saying as being an Insider there that no choices well you and we disagreeing with that well Jay or You' agree with J Jay is the only one right now um that I actually think is pretty good but the point that I'll make is that he's actually confirming for me what your and I's feeling is that it's not going well on the federal so we may need to start paying more attention to the state side than not and I think that that's where you and I are in a pretty good situation can I add on to that try to constructively um so first off lpo um totally agree and um you know I I I I think he's he's a great leader and should be having a national voice and that's my opinion so um on the picks I mean I agree with your frustration I mean like like this is I mean I think we're in a big opportunity Fally I think we need to be doing aggressive State actions I think people should be listening to you Jack I mean like on on on your ideas and on this data I mean I I you might not just so you know they are listening to me everybody in Washington DC reads my tweets just so you know that they do okay good because I have confir confirmation that but realize something else I'm the guy sitting at the table that wrote a constitutional amendment I Know Jack Jack that's actually in their hands and they don't want to do something with it my like in the United States my literal goal in life is to help get radical ideas and transformed ideas into health and what I'm trying to tell you is the people that you think are going to help they're not helping so so I so Jack I'm super cynical about DC I don't think you are I think you're actually I think you're still looking for that job no so so so so we can get into my story on that um you might be right I mean we all have psychological Hang-Ups that we are working a lifetime to get over and I've explained kind of the continuing to collect you know plots along the way I mean sure like everyone has their wounded child I'm I'm sure you do and are working on that too I mean like no no I mean everyone's got their their traumas um I I would say that everything did change when I you know decided to focus on this issue and and Casey need to put our hearts out and you know I I you know everyone is the hero in their own head and and has pure intentions probably but we are trying to spread a message of light out there and um you know I think I think any type of power you might be overstating but like you know like you we're trying to push power it's not power C I want you I I I just think this this is the part of you that comes off so disingenuous you are an expert in legalized lying that's what PR and lobbying is let me finish it's not debatable but you told me that you reformed and I am taking you at your word MH you have to realize that propaganda is a tool of the government Obama has weaponized it against us by law and the pharmaceutical industry can do it on TV that's how we lost our first amendment you know that we talked about out which you acknowledge I'm trying to stop we talked about that on the last podcast my point that I'm trying to say is if the propaganda doesn't go away on the federal level we we're not going to be successful at all that is the point and the point when you say Well Jack I don't know about this and that you have to realize do you understand you know I don't want to be a dick with you and and throw the gaunlet down about ignorance and fraud but when I say to you clearly that the propaganda arm here is a big issue and the fact that the people you used to work with that's their I'm calling out Jack Well Jack Jack I respectfully you've done a lot you're pushing a lot I don't think anyone's talking more about the need to ban Pharm advertising and how nefarious that is and how that allows the pharmaceutical industry not only to brainwash people but also to buy off the news itself and none of the people that Trump are putting at the federal level are doing that that's the point I'm trying to make Jack it's get no logic problem so I'm talking about that bringing that as much the Nal stage I possibly can in order subvert it why wouldn't I just subvert it in the first place well iess no I guess you missed my point like by you saying that to me you missed the point the point is you're okay with what they're doing at the federal level but you're not supportive of President Trump what he's doing he's appointed the best reform-minded group of people for HHS in American history I'm extremely supportive and extremely optimistic I also extremely who's who's I think it's the status quo who's a more reform-minded HHS group of people this is this is Marty has pledged not to go to Pharma after this I think all 20 the past 20 years every single FDA commissioner has gone straight to Pharma these people right now are not going back to Pharma so Jack I I I would say if you investigate and if you're honest the past 20 years of HHS leadership this is the most reform-minded you might not think it's reform minded enough but it is it is let me tell you what it's about my friend ideation without execution ideation without execution leads to deletion of every good idea I don't give a [ __ ] what they say I I want to see the action I 100% age you're willing to give them a olive branch now and I'm not Jack I'm not giving they don't deserve [ __ ] you want to know the truth we have to hold their feet to the fire hold hold on hold on hold on we can hold their feet to the fire of course but I think the question is it's a fair question how do we support Bobby and Trump and this team as much as we POS maybe that's not what you think you should do but like no we shouldn't support them at all they need to do the will of the people right that's what they need to do not the will of Cali not the will of Cali Cali wants to be let's transparency transparency what do you think we should do what it down that's what I think well I I it down so so so so what literally what would you advise I would tell Elon and vivec to close places down and I'd start with the intelligence commun can we can we can we back hold on hold on I'd start with everything tied to science Jack Jack CU there's nobody worthwhile in there can we step can we step back and actually calmly talk about what your I'm very calm okay can we talk can we talk about what your 100 day plan like would be like like like what constitutional amendment okay so so what should what what what would be your recommendation of how to um you know anybody associated with goes to Guantanamo Bay first and foremost okay that's it that's the first thing I do okay and I know that if gats was in that had happen mhm that's that's the first place and then I'd start changing laws the first law I Chang it's the 1980 law that allows allows uh scientists paid by taxpayers to benefit from research that should end yeah I think I don't think there's anyone in the country that's talked more about that than me so well I got new for you it ain't going to happen Okay and with the people that Trump's put in the second thing that needs to happen is the liability law leads needs to go by the way and here's the the big issue the first 100 days the only thing Bobby should focus in on only thing is a RICO case against everybody associated with Mass RNA technology and that includes the department of fense how would you do that I just told you how I do it I'm not I'm not investigate we we already have Fouch emails we have moren's emails we have tons of data you seem to act like the DAT is not there Kevin mckernan literally could go to Congress and tell them that he found sv40 anybody associated with the FDA approval process Guantanamo Bay not suggesting that data is not there I'm suggesting that we certainly don't fund foundational research on why we're getting sick that then you don't data is being covered covered up and then you don't solve there's huge so so so I think so you just want to ignore everything that's already out there no not at all so you want to kind of do what YouTube oh I think as much Bobby's talked about getting rid of the fisa uh department just just open source and release as much as we possibly have that's a huge part of transparency we need ability though or El people need to go to jail hold on so so so so and and again my story is we're not interested in your story we're interested in the story of we the people I'm giving my opinion is that any like we all come from different perspectives I am just trying to think just intellectually like this is what I like doing is like how do you Channel this spiritual awakening I believe many people in America are having about our Healthcare system being broken and the incentives being destroyed and channel that into actionable ideas that can get done in the first year and that's not like me I'm not controlling like you know I'm speaking like a politician and a lobbyist well well maybe see and and I maybe definitely hold on Jack my story is that's actually what our big problem is with you my story my story is and this this is for you know respond to is that talking about practicality puts your guys alarm signals up that I'm somehow trying to subvert something it's like we are at the time now we we actually should feel that way okay but but but but but but there is a question of what should be done in 63 days right I just told you but the people that we know have committed fraud need to go to guantan I I don't think I don't think suggesting to to to send people to Guantanamo might be the best political I mean I don't care about the political part I do I do I do he know like if if he is this world and he understands how to talk to these people and communicate with these folks like you understand you do understand that saying that sending everyone to guantan a is like an unrealistic it sounds crazy right it no it doesn't let me ask you a question what what happened at norenberg did we have a discussion with the Nazis Jack understand what you're saying Jack do you cuz he doesn't no I understand what you're saying but what what I'm trying to you think we should be sending people too I don't know how what the logistics are but I think the spirit of that is correct I just you know there's probably a different way of doing it yeah but the bottom line is we need Swift immediate accountability for I mean this is I I just feel think we should be send I know why don't you call her an ask her Jack but like you know call these people that you know pay you and that are you knows you yeah um you know who pays me here right here Callie look okay coin who pays me no but I'm a huge I'm a huge fan right hold on I'm a huge fan of Nicole but like but like oh I don't think you are oh I am she used to be like and then she hold on we don't need to get no I'm just saying people in the polit more in the political Arena aren't calling for people to be sent to Guantanamo like like that's right because guess what they're all complicit in it even you're right Congress voted for this stuff you are correct I'm saying people like Nicole people that are on the Nicole wasn't a politician she's in a patent attorney for Google and and and by the way I think she's been a warrior on this I'm just saying like you're being very selective here saying that no I'm not yeah I'm I'm a diagn like your sister I'm the diagn what's your hatred in your heart from my sister you don't know her and she she's think I just think it's kind of weak that she quit and she doesn't have a big voice a big voice on this topic about which topic bro are you gonna keep dancing wait this is videos on the videos that you you have all the stuff he sent but yes yes I have everything I have everything we you want to show them no it's fine I mean there's a ton of videos of us talking about and um that's just inaccurate but yeah on the Rogan podcast specifically the the JRE episode she did mention Megan Kelly and every and I talked a lot about OIC and and other pharmaceutical drugs as well talked about schedule on every podcast but do you acknowledge that yeah I've heard her talk about it but not loud enough she's talked more about Froot Loops and and glucose I don't think Casey's ever talked I talk about Froot Loops and I don't think Casey has ever talked about fro Loops but but um um where are we getting here so I think that the point he's making it's like maybe we come from a different angles I actually really sympathize with what you were saying on this revolutionary mindset like I intellectually I'm trying to think about like what could actually get done in the next 100 days and how to recommend things for that and then you know being practical in that stamf front isn't betraying the movement as far as what the people are asking for and what this movement is asking for I think there's a battle right now to Define what the Maha M was about and I do and I I believe that it was fueled by significant frustration from a broad base of the American people about multi a multitude of issues including what you guys are talking about and I think did the American public ask for transparency when the Japanese bomb par Harbor or when the Mad ran two planes into the1 what happened then hold on did they want accountability there's a premise there's a premise Mary how many people have died from the jab by the estimates that you know the low end to the highend numbers vary but 500,000 so you're what's the high end what's the high end the guy in Austria said it close to 17 million right right well that's worldwide so let's just let's just say it's probably neither of those numbers somewhere in between and we don't should be we don't know but Callie let me ask you a question some plant cuz I don't want to I'm going to ask you a question how many people died in World War II from the United States uh 57,000 yeah so we already have more people on the lowend dead and you want to talk about Froot Loops no no no what that's not good faith man no it's not no it's not want okay this good Fai you do you know that's not good faith or you no I I want to hear I want to hear you adapt to the data and you're not hold on if that is true cuz you're a big data guy but you don't like this data no I'm I'm not a big data guy oh yes you are I've heard enough of your podcast oh like like I site data correct okay but it's data that suits your ideology Jack and you've said this is the stuff I'm saying really not in the service of what you're trying to say no it is but you're not talking about the elephant in the room I just told you what the elephant in the room is we have killed more people in the last four years than we did in any world war we've been involved with and you want transpar going to give my true yes because I do not think the American people are with you on that stage right now I disagree because if they were with and guess what I'm glad you said that this podcast you're going to get fact checked oh no no hold on hold on if do you think that the American people are with you that the jab has been a bigger issue than world word two that jab specific that should be pulled from the market not even not not even an inkling doubt then I strongly support and I'm not being factious here at all I strongly support your voes being heard and being part of a policymaking process to bring that to light and to have Swift and mediate decisions based on that data like like like like you're you're pinning me down on like making I'm not trying to pin you down I'm trying to point out it's almost like your tone you just said you just said on Danny's podcast that you are so happy with Trump's picks if you go on Twitter have you been on Twitter well have you seen the kickback nobody lik Jack Jack Jack Jack you might be in too many dark spaces of Twitter but um uh that's not real yeah jbi the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] I like I like I like Jack maybe the the places you hang out with on Twitter are different than than other places but I would agree that they're different than yours yours yours I think are a very the only place I've been dragged into that's that's that I I I I think most America I was going to say is from some of your stuff a lot of them I think Americans generally would you agree I I think there's generally a sense of possibility and optimism in the country right now that we haven't felt in the not anymore I feel that I do feel that I do feel there's a sense of optimism I do not in health in general I do I I would agree with you that that [[Donald Trump|Trump]] absolutely was a way better pick you know that I flew back here to vote for him right right right so there's not that's not a question my point and I think you guys are both missing what me and Mary are saying since the picks have started to come out on the hell side no I feel deflated yeah no one is Happy Well in in in your Twitter circles right oh okay that's kind of rude I mean no no I think it's a little no but I think it's okay I think it's a fair criticism let's just say let's just say yeah my so you're saying that I don't represent most Americans right and the IDI let look at the up that's not what I'm saying heard I think that if you look okay let's just do the the uptake of the shot that that's irrefutable that represents all of America right so if the if if people believed in the government they would follow the government directives and be lining up for their 11th booster they taking their kids to get is good no right but it's a reflection blows your narrative straight out the water a reflection of the mindset of America hold on Jack no it actually Jack is a general we can talk about this as much as you want but like like it's we can't because dude you know what you're you know what talking it's like we're trying to dance and you don't move your feet and it's really no it's a gun to my head to say that you know what the problem is you're a lobbyist bro that's your DNA Jack and that ain't going to change that's I realized an hour ago is there anything Cali could say that would help you feel differently no not anymore I think he's done a good job in two hours and 13 minutes of actually I I this I will say can you say something nice yeah thank I I thought on the the asset test I had for him on ignorance or fraud I don't think he's a fraudster I don't but I think he's incredibly ignorant and I think his ideology his previous history his family history is a role here no question in my mind about it now how big a role that is I still haven't defined that I still haven't defined that but do I think is there anything he could do that would change your mind yeah I think if he goes back to DC because it's clear as a young man this is what he's cut out to do there's no question in my mind I thought I wasn't a good communicator no I think you are a good communicator I just don't think I think because of your ignorance on this issue that you won't be effective you won't be effective what is it possible for call to do that would help people he needs to go back and wake some people up and say you know what maybe maybe the way we're reading the room maybe we're toned de I think that's kind of what we're doing right now is so as long as this episode doesn't get blown you know BL It Off YouTube for some reason put on Rumble yeah no hold on Jack Jack so so so you'll grant me you'll grant me that potentially Casey and I in our hearts and heads care about this issue started talking about it I'm dealing specifically with you I haven't dealt with your sister yet F I care about this issue I'm talking about it it's very dark very complicated I'm very Jack I'm not sleeping I'm so worried about this agenda getting subverted like it's very high stakes and very there's very bad people out there that are wanting president Trump and Bobby to not be successful like I I I that's all I'm thinking about like and and and not that I even have that much of a role in this it's just like as a as a person that cares about this issue so like I'm with you on that we might have different perspectives on it um as far I don't know maybe there's a difference on blowing things up I mean geez Jack I mean I felt like what I was trying to say in the past couple years was you know pretty dramatic I certainly was trying to communicate effectively um I don't think it was dramatic I think people have been saying what you've been saying for since Atkins and and guess what and a lot of the people it's that's not the message that resonates with America not well I think it's not I mean our our book is so well and people L I mean I don't know books selling well you know you know how many books 250 diet books are written every year and yet what happens every time we keep using non-native EMF all the way back from 1893 the enhan stuff gets worse and worse and worse Jack gu what I'm saying if we don't make the accurate diagnosis we're not going to solve ja you're saying the message hasn't resonated I'm just like maybe I I'm trying you know most people what do you want me to say like like you want me to be more radical like no I want you actually take the data that Mary and I are bringing to you that more people why are you piing on me on this like why AR what's the what's the you're the guy on Tucker Carlson and Joe BR Tucker man no you don't get it bro what I I must not this is this is where I'm saying this is where you get to be a fraud star okay I'm going to be honest with you and and you know I think that this podcast is going to polarize many people who look both you talking can we stop talking meta about the podcast every second and just talk no I mean we've already talk go I've got I've already got my answer okay what and what is that I already told you I don't need to repeat it for if you need to listen to you can listen Steve will send it back to you by email what can I ask you what prompted you to call Trump and Kennedy what what was the that there was um a Deep Emotions watching Trump get shot and I thought that there might be a rare window to spread Unity that when traumatic things happen it resets how people think about things were you you were working with Kennedy at the time you were on his campaign my sister and I have been Lo very loose like with Kennedy like we're I think really lined on this message of the childhood chronic disease crisis and have shared some ideas with him have gone on some podcast with him have spoken at some of his events and haven't talked to him that much at all during the campaign I just felt I I from DC I think we all and maybe you honestly attribute more thought and strategy to what people do than actually I see happening that when you're in a campaign or a high stake situation and things are happening so fast you actually don't have like an opportunity to think about where you could actually go in a different direction so I had a real strong sense um from my experience that maybe there was a different road to go after the shooting you know when when when I mean Pharma was ready Pharma was ready during Co to insert and the when when these when these unexpected things happen you know it there's an opportunity to maybe reset the deck in a positive or negative way so I was nervous but I decided to just call him for 20 seconds and mention that um and then um he thought about it and and and ended up starting that conversation I mean that was a 20 yeah Kennedy that was a 20- second conversation that I'm a very you know that was Kennedy you know just um thinking about it and decid and they had you know they ended up I think forming a really important Bond um that was going to go to the grave and then he mentioned that in a speech um I had no desire ever for that to be public um and he mentioned that in his concession speech and then we shared some ideas with him during the campaign and then that's pretty much it I mean like um yeah are you going to get a job in the new Administration no Kennedy has been the most outspoken person in the past on these V in this country that not now though well and and he wrote the book about fouchy which is literally all about this stuff right um it's great book fabulous book it is a great book yeah but you can tell that he's been and why do you think why do you think specifically that he has changed his tune that's pretty obvious I think it's the lobbyist from Big Pharma that's remember they said at the Calon effect the highest the the the you think he's taking money from big farm no no no I don't think it's he's taking money from it I think that they are so powerful that they're bringing the forces to Bear about what can be done politically or not that's where I actually agree with him that this has become a political issue and it's not a medical issue and see the thing that underpins all this is what you and I talked about on our podcast it's the bankers the bankers are the ones that pay for all this [ __ ] and until we fix that problem now here's the one thing we haven't talked about the fact that both Bobby and Trump are big into [[Bitcoin]] as the reserve asset let me tell you something I actually think that is the thing that really fixes more than anything Bobby can do at HHS now I don't even think it's it's I don't think he's going to be successful at all well can I so totally disagree with you on what you said about Bobby but on the on the macro dnamic of the lobbyists and these dark interest just forming the Realms of acceptable debate I I think we we do agree on that I mean that that's a real concern I think you know we have in health this kind of they call the healthcare economy it's like it's like already you know you see this pressure it's like anything radical to actually change the health par oh it's Gonna Hurt jobs it's gonna do I mean it's it's really complicated really nefarious I I to me to me I I don't think it's that complicated can I tell you why let me just tell you why yeah I might agree with that in five years who Kelly changed everything in El Salvador so you would say okay that's one guy it's different but let me tell you something else that everybody at this table knows a guy just got elected in Argentina who had a hundred-year problem with Communism and he's fixed things already in six months you know what the problem with DC is the problem in DC nothing gets fixed I agree with that so guess what you know why nothing gets fixed is because nobody's willing to do the hard work like when you have a tumor and you're taking it out or I have a tumor we're willing to do the hard work to get it out okay that's what we have this messenger RNA story is a tumor and that we have to put our time and effort into fixing that one problem and we need to do it well because when we do it well then we can apply that to other problems and that's the way it should be done I agree how do you suggest they get this message to the Forefront of the people his message mess yeah what he just said how do you a message I think what you just said is true I I I think I think what you said is something I'm dealing with which is that I believe that something really positive happened during the campaign and people were woken up on health and it actually my and and why I called and what my framework has been and what if I have have any master plan what it's been it's been that to weaponize and make change with what we're all saying and I think what we actually agree with on general principles on more health needs to go it needs to be politically important it needs to be politically popular people need to see it as a politically important voting block we already have that the problem is no no Jack Jack campaigns are won with talk no jack hold on on you want to win people's hearts actions I'll be quick I'll be quick it's not Health has not been a politically important issue people vote on issues like guns abortion like like really hot topic issues I do believe the Maha movement made Health actually a voting issue yeah but Cali I disagree because guess what the issue right now for the United States is I agree I'll be 30 seconds so so so the Mah would you agree you are you are again redirecting here that's the problem we have with you okay well just speak for yourself but okay um the Maha movement catalyzed I think a new Coalition of Voters that came to president Trump firsttime Women Voters Independence I think they're Bobby Kennedy and the Maha movement had an impact on the campaign that gives political currency and this isn't anything about Trump or anyone this is just politics that that gives political currency to actually get something done now exactly as you said you have to bash your head against the wall against this crazy corrupt ingrained bureaucracy to get anything done and it's much much much harder the campaign was great I think it was really positive it's much much harder now to get something done and it seems like maybe we' got two leaders it seems like it seems like maybe the the the this debate or this whole question is like should we be giving up on Bobby and Trump on the health agenda because it's going to get hard it absolutely is going to get hard and I think ideally we're all supportive and not you know kind of all I don't think we're giving up on them I'm I'm what I'm saying is campaigns are talk we need Mary has been she said it several times we need on the platter and the appropriate we don't need a lower level guy we need Fouch on the platter and based on who he has appointed other than Bobby other than jod aaria it it gives it deflates my hope that actually something's actually going to happen you don't have very many you know strong willed uh outspoken people who have been appointed to the health positions and I love Jay bachara but he's a little on the you know in terms of how much outspoken how he's on the more cautious side um and you know we don't have anybody who's just out there saying chot should be pulled off the market even though there's lots of support for that uh if you want you knowa supports it the data support forget about people's opinion the data supports it historical precedent like if you if you're you're a lawyer historical precedent matters we pulled the swine flu after a couple of deaths we have by the estimates we just talked about 550 to 17 million you name guys we've talked about this 50 times I'm not standing in your way of any of this information getting out or that policy getting done I think it should get out I I I don't know what you want from me I like I I it is not my issue I'm being educated on it I I fully support that information getting out and that being part of a policy process for any pharmaceutical product that's killing a bunch of people I think politically it's important I I absolutely not coming out with ideas on food banss I think we should have mass transparency I think start with that from a tactical perspective I think if a if a drug is killing millions of people or hundreds of thousands of people we should have that information out immediately you guys should not have your voices silenced I think that's why Elon and free speech is extremely important to this and I think I nobody saying your way on that I'm certainly not like like like I I I don't know the first time you've heard that the shots are killing millions of people you're acting like it Millions or just you know you never heard let's just say let's be more that the risk outweigh the benefits of the is this the first time you've heard that well I think personally that they do and and I I think it's insane to give them to kids I I haven't gotten you know boosters or anything um and um and uh you know I think that's step one I think there should be Absol no come to that conclusion you talk to your sister yeah yeah I mean we're all you know yeah did you take the shot general public did I I took the F the first time so let me ask you a question hold on wait a minute now we're going to get to the haven't gotten boost fine yeah do do you know about Kevin's uh data that he just guys guys I am super distrustful but I'm saying do you know forget about that don't don't go don't go where you think I'm going to go no no I don't I I 60 billion copies of DNA plasmas and sv40 promoter in it so I want you to just you know you're a normal guy yeah you're not a science guy right somebody told you that you had 60 billion promoters in your body doing [ __ ] that you didn't know about do do you understand why as two guys sitting across the table and I'm telling you that the guy who did this used to work in the human genon project he was sitting here talking to Danny about it not that long ago and that episode's been pull by the powers that be crazy right so what I'm trying to really get you to understand you understand that I and Mary and your sister have to Advocate on behalf of people that have that problem do you think that's reasonable do you do you understand why when we question you about it and what Mary just said to you Cali do you know what you took what the jab do you know what what you took and do you know what you got bad but yet you're not willing I don't think are you saying you're not willing though you're not willing not willing to what to pull the Jabs to to make a statement I am not make a statement to pull the Jabs yeah very easy it's very easy thing to say and that's what we don't understand but no but nobody like no I'm not that's not so you're okay that you got 60 billion copies of sv40 in you is that what you're saying no I think it's I think it's really really concerning I think it's a is it conning Jack I can say this Jack just let me let me just answer your question again I am taking the same position as Trump and Bobby and many other people that are trying to figure out a way to absolutely dismantle the pharmaceutical and sickcare incentives that have led to this catastrophe of the co response including the roll out and I think a wider issue of Our Sick care system my answer to you if you're asking for my policy recommendation no I'm asking you for you as a I'm not taking I'm not taking another JB and do you think it's ethical for a doctor knowing that there's 60 billion copies to put that into another human being I think that an ethical question not say if what you were saying is true then no I do not think it's ethical if what you were saying is true see it wasn't that hard C no no if what you were saying hold on I made a quote if what you're saying is true if what you're saying I already know it's true what's your reluctance to get another shot why what is your reluctance to not get another shot that based on what it's a good question yeah um and I think it's a fair one the risk the risk reward okay the risk reward my interpretation of the would you recommend that your dad get the shot no would you recommend your your child absolutely not so who would you recommend that why do we need to keep these shots on the market so so so guys I'm not evil for saying this let's just back up not evading there's a couple different levels there's let people make their own decisions with full transparency now I think that's very evil in a lot of ways because our system is beyond recognition with the so so I get that I get that I get that's actually what you think no what I'm saying is in her Hospital remember what she said her Hospital there mandating which is crazy so so so so so so there's there's the the what the minimum is full transparency and let people make their own decisions I actually probably like you am a Libertarian and I I honestly think the regulation on drugs if as long as there's full transparency let people experiment what they want to experiment I I'm I'm generally a supporter that now I get that now I I kind of have this problem with food you know I get attacked for you know you know oh you're Nanny State you want to ban these I'm like the ingredients that are in the food is totally a construct of a very corrupt system and correcting the corrupt so you probably feel me saying like you probably feel me saying like um like just let people make their own decision is not correcting for the incredible Injustice but that's one area you can have that's decentralization we have to have that I I think I think any type of mandates are completely unacceptable particularly on this issue you have to have that and I think everyone's align with the insistence of absolute truth and transparency and low and no mes that okay then you get to a situation where you have Truth and Reconciliation and transparency on this being a bioweapon on this being really killing people on this being totally misled my personal opinion if you're asking from a macro policy perspective and I could be wrong on this this is my opinion is that we are not at the that point of absolute utter ban and actually the principles probably that we actually agree with on a lot of degrees is more of a Libertarian full transparency and let people make their own decision with no mandates so what I again I am not standing and Jack we're having we're connecting I don't get why you're tweeting hundreds of times about me like like I'm not standing I am truly Look At Me Hold on we're not fighting I actually I think we're connecting I I I am not trying to stop progress on any of this okay this is what I want to say I'm not that's my opinion I I I think we're not quite there at a full ban okay all right politically because because going against mandates is a very safe thing to say right now it was not safe when I said it when I said it I I tweeted about in 2021 you picked out I have I actually have tweeted about you of anything I'm just saying that this the Paradigm has shifted okay because at one point it was very dangerous to say eliminate you know mandates are wrong that's what I got canceled for that's what methodists went after me on one day I tweeted 25 times seeing mandates are wrong over and over again and then five days remember that day 5 days later next thing I know I've been suspended isn't it suicide for these folks to literally ban something that was mandated two years ago isn't that suicide no because they they have liability but but they actually have liability where the issue comes in is the RICO case right right exactly that's the difference for sure but so now I I guarantee you five five years from now you'll be you'll be say oh yeah those shs are really bad we should have taken them off the market a long time ago because the Paradigm is going to continue to sh because we are not giving up I mean I am I'm just getting louder and louder and louder and especially you know it'll be very interesting to see once [[Donald Trump|Trump]] takes office because I can guarantee you there's so many people that went along just to get Trump in office and if he disappoints it's going to be a big deal people are going to completely freak out I I would say that there's been a very positive Coalition that's come together that could redefine American politics who's very focused on Mala issues that include getting the corruption out of our pharmaceutical systems I think that's a great opportunity too yeah sorry to interrupt yeah and it's it's very clear especially with people like you who have been outspoken with it and I think it's a very good thing that you're doing this and and you've garnered a ton of attention on X I mean you have like over half a million followers on X and meanwhile simultaneously you cannot be found on YouTube I think that speaks volumes yeah exactly I I've been cancelled and I have these videos that run on other platforms but I was quickly removed off of YouTube which I think is unacceptable and anti-science but it it fits the world live normal it doesn't even bother me now cuz I'm just like oh yeah of course it doesn't even and that's sad it's normalized I think anything obviously anything that the powers that be that you have a lot of distrust for both you guys and should are like preventing the American people and infantilizing them from asking questions about is a huge huge red flag and I think you know not just with health but the what you know Trump is talking about with this you know Elon and and everything it's like it's like getting more sunlight out I think we I think you know again like Jack I'm not saying I'm not aware of the crazy forces and the huge reasons to be pessimistic but like I do think the first I'm giving you I'm giving you more credit now because you are walking a very fine line don't don't think that I don't understand that okay I'm not I'm not looking to Harpoon your reputation over that I get the fact that this is a very very fine line for you um if I was in your shoes and I wasn't a doctor I could see your perspective clearly mhm um I think what I came here really to find out was that truly who c means was or or not now the thing is I think you could have gotten around this much much easier than we did today if you actually would have said that now remember I respect you for you running your own race cuz that's what I teach my my my customers to do but I I need you to always be mindful in the future that talk about the big elephant in the room let's not just talk about our ideology like I I didn't talk about some of the ideology that I have about this whole thing because to be honest with you this is where Mary and I are very strongly aligned the scene is is the biggest issue of the day I I would I tell my people it's always about artificial light and non-native EMF and big teac but she's right Jack's not here talking about that it's the vacine and the amount of people that have been killed by it um to be honest with you history will be written someday about what some of us did and I'm just going to tell you Kevin mckernan yeah is an absolute hero Philip buckolz is a hero but I'm going to let you know there's people out there that you're acquainted with that got them the data they needed M to have this story come out and those in Washington DC they're going to pay a price for it sooner or later they're going to pay a price and the people that really made this decision I I don't I don't think they will but think they're GNA Ja Jack so so you know okay there's I see the I see it as this Coalition of many different perspectives coming together and I think you guys and one of the reasons I wanted to come here is because I I you know and I've appreciate connecting with you I knew I knew your heart was just totally fighting for your patience I that was so clear to me and I think you I in my head you share a similar desire I have which is we're warriors and trying to and and and and Jack I I I know in many places of your heart you're you're I you've suffered a lot you've been you know taken a lot of arrows much more than I have and and are fighting for this I've seen myself as one person not supplanting anything but just trying to help and I think one way you know this can really be positive is to wake you know and and as many people as possible up and and I you know I don't think we should have incremental change but I think you know I think I think you guys would probably agree with we got we got a shot like in the next two years I think if if we don't get some progress and I believe it's more holistic I I do my bra I I think it's all but but but but if we agree with that if we agree with that then how do we get there and talking about it as aggressively as you're talking about it in the first day is not necessarily you can grant this that's there's a separate between what the goal is and what the strategy is so so you're saying that because I'm not aggressively going it might not be the right strategy to tell on day one to put everyone in Guantanamo Bay and mass bands to achieve the result that you're looking to achieve that's what I would just ask you like I I think there is a difference and I I I believe that in your guys head that me thinking about the strategy is a sign for suspicion there's no question you have a different goal fa no no no I I don't I don't know I actually don't know if that's true Did We convince you no no hold on so so so so so well actually we shouldn't have to convince them what should really convince you is hopefully Danny gives you the Kevin mckernan podcast and you listen to what he says in there well can can I be honest with you I am focused on I mean what what drives my passion is talking about a multi-dimensional front on kids that includes a richer and richer data points that's what I'm passionate about I'm not passionate about going in podcast and arguing that one thing is more important than the other and I do and we've talked about this I do think that um you know what's happened to alra processed food with kids is a really important issue I'm not trying to even stack rank that the book actually very importantly it says food is very important but it doesn't stack rank it actually says there's a multi-dimensional threat I do think no no no well so so I I would say you can't back away from that it doesn't have the word hold on and it was written during is that true it doesn't have the word once it doesn't I read it I can tell you hold on hold on the book was turned in yeah like before like 20121 2022 um the book The book's the book absolutely and this isn't like some secret like strategy it's like we didn't want to talk about the Co in the book that wasn't even discussion I had with anybody it's just like that was not the purpose of the book off limits just no it was never discussion never disc never discuss with me and Casey never discuss people who do podcast hold on okay sure never discussion with me and Casey never a um discussion with our Publishers self-centring I don't know but but like I would say you know that wasn't what we were trying to write about like like we were trying to make we were trying to write a book for a parent who is totally in the dark about this [ __ ] and we talked about this that that book could be a Gateway I think our books probably been a Gateway for people like probably hopefully going more down the rabbit hole and like listening to your guys stuff like I think there's a lot of overl like that was the purpose of the book the purpose of the book is that I read some other books and kind of started going down the rabbit hole and I'm more down the rabbit hole now so like that book that was the purpose of the book it was not a deliberate thing not to mention but it again I think it talks a lot about pharmaceuticals and I do think the book is a gateway you know as part of big it's happening with many things so if that book leads people to follow you and and leads people on a journey I can tell you I think it has actually opened the door for a lot of people on a journey and it's not a journey to love vaccines and Trust the medical system um so so that that that was the goal um on that as far as what I'm passionate about like I I just can't emphasize this enough like there like I want you guys to get the message out like we should have these conversations I think I think the Tactical I think it goes to your point about DC my personal opinion is you can get a couple big things done this is my thought there's got to be some really big wins that are really visible and really quick on this imputing this idea of Our Sick care system and then as winds pile up there's an 880,000 person department and we can hopefully get good people in there and they can do bureaucratic things to unwind the Deep State along with the vag along with Elon and I think there's a very optimistic Mission there my personal opinion is if you go day one and tell to lock everyone out go Dono it's actually going to subvert I would actually potentially argue if you want to be conspirator that you're the one that's actually trying to subvert exactly what you're trying to get done and you know what I respect your opinion of that but here's where I know you're dead wrong okay I might I I got bu Kelly and Malay as proof that it's right happened he's a dictator no he's not well it's a little bit less Democratic checks and Norms how can for how can you say that when he got 90% of the vot I think he's great I I'm just saying there's a a little bit of less checks there and you know fine but um I would say there's less checks to the United States Jack Jack Jack we're looking at each other I know I know you agree with this like I think it's a little bit your head in the sand say oh If Only They just accepted my Constitutional Amendment that's what you're saying no I'm not what are you saying they did it without the Constitutional Amendment that's the whole point Jack like Jack let like they they slashed and burned government they closed places down that needed to be closed down Jack Jack I am like they didn't they didn't have it discussion they didn't wait for transparency Jack they cut the cancer out you have been very effective if you want to strategize not that I could even offer you that much like your idea should get out there like I fully support that like nobody's standing your way like I don't think anything I've done has in any way stood in your way like like like I you know absolutely will listen to this podcast I think I I like it is actually exciting listening to you guys talk and like the idea of in the next year more truth getting out there like like I support that and to to Callie's uh point or to the point that was made about the book not having vaccines mentioned in it or not having the Cod shots mentioned in it whether it was intentional or not that is definitely something like if that was a book that I was writing that is something I would absolutely think about whether I want the book to get out there get picked up by a publisher and gain any sort of success I know that if I talk about that there is a way higher chance that that thing is going to get hit the chopping block and not get out there whe like I said I don't know the honest the honest truth is that's it's definitely the honest truth is is is it was like like like you know this like you guys can like I I am absolutely trying to communicate these Concepts as effectively as I can never have I been like I can't talk about I can give you that pass I don't know if I can give your sister that pass I'm gonna be honest with you she's a doctor there's a difference like I don't expect the lobbyist who went to Stanford and Harvard to really understand the ethics of this issue yeah yeah but me and Mary on the front lines no look when you're when you see people dying from this no I'm sorry well we listen Cas Casey can defend herself whenn if she chooses but I'd say in the realm of doctors who have you know kind of tried to speak out and U shed light on the industry you know you guys are very very out there you know I'd say Casey's far along on the Spectrum too I mean she has been disinvited from a lot of the cocktail parties and and and has definitely gone and gone gets the system and has been on her journey and is is trying to communicate in her way that I believe is is very spiritually based and has impacted and connected with a lot of people in a way that's not in any way contradictory or not overlapping with what you guys are trying to say honestly so um you know that that's my that's my that's my opinion um on that I think just again um we have a passion to try to articulate this overarching thesis about the system and and I think Casey you know she she was in the front page article just a couple weeks ago attacked by the New York Times as being antiv she's published a lot about uh vaccine liability and so it's just like it's just not you find that it's just not even true if you Google New York Times Casey vaccine I mean she's Lally you know so like she's out there she's taken she's taken some hits so like it I mean if we're together here Jack I mean you can do whatever you want listen I I I torment doctors I've actually become friends with some of them like I you know I actually think dialog to but I'm not trying to build a consensus that I don't get why you are doing hundreds of tweets it just it's just kind of like you know I don't know I think I think in your heart I think in your heart I think in your heart you are fighting for the right thing I I don't I don't want to get into motivations but it's just like whatever this is where I'm coming from um I I just I just um I only fight for the truth good and and I think you have a record of that I mean I think some of it's out there but you got to be a little out there to fight for the I whatever everyone's got their own tactics I I think the macro like the macro thing here maybe what's like applicable to most listeners it's like I think you guys are hanging this question of like I don't know like are we in a time of optimism for health um I don't think being Mary are optimistic anymore we're not that's what I said you and Danny the table is definitely seesaw your way we're not we're not feeling it I don't know whatever yeah is it behind a payall think in the first hundred days we're gonna find out if who's right on this oh oh you might you might be oh yeah yeah yeah whatever I mean which one is it Trump's transition team I don't know yeah it's like Casey's an anti was like a couple weeks agoy F I'm just it's fine um you you know we've spoken about this and I I I feel like you're I don't I think you've spoken it but I need this to be your top message so that's never going to happen Okay let me tell you why hold on hold on I no you don't have to tell me you already told me for two and a half hours I get it but but do you not grant that me communicating and trying to communicate which could totally evolve but I think buy that you I think I can buy you not doing it but I can't buy your sister but but but why like like it's getting the same answer like why like getting people bought into this system being totally rigged against us and do you disagree with what my foundational goal in life is with from a policy perspective which is that 95% of uh medical funding right now medical spending is on interventions after we get sick basically the drug and we should free that up to have people experiment about exercise about light about whatever my goal I'm actually totally different than you I want the whole system blown up great like I don't I don't even want to talk about the syst decentralized yeah like like you're probably more but like that is like I don't I'm not interested in that that is um that is what I'm trying to do too so like probably in different but like so you're telling me that you're not satisfied unless well let me ask you because I know you're very close with Nicole that's not her message like that's not other people's message why aren't you that hard on her why why aren't you that hard on her I am you the thing the thing is has uh publicly stated that should be pulled off the market she has good she on Twitter I'm just I'm just giving example no I'm just giving example like like if you asked Nicole or Jake um my first two encounters with Nicole you you'll find out that I treated you with kid gloves I was brutal to her good this says K or Casey was floated to be the what would go up to be the head of the what the FDA okay yeah just you guys it's fine there's there's a New York Times article that say in her newsletter question vaces I'm just saying like like Casey has you know I don't know like we have a thesis do you even disagree do you disagree with our key thesis like do you even like do you even like like I know you I think we all said we said we agreed we already AG what's the problem I told you what the problem is your pro the problem is your sister even though she doesn't have a license she's a doctor and and guess what those people that have D MD more is wanted I I give you the pass because you know what you're just complet sorry but you do have a gigantic microphone and you have the the the ear of she's hold feet to the more than I am Kennedy and Trump and your whole thing is health so I do I do I'm not giving you a pass but I give I guess Casey has a little more because she is a doctor but if you didn't have this this big platform we wouldn't you know I wouldn't give you any trouble whatsoever listen I think this is a great conversation I just say for everyone like everyone needs to be on their own thing and I think actually outside agitation and disrupt and criticism frankly is what I feel like I've been doing the past couple years like I think it's fine I also don't think you need to there's any moral obligation to be supportive of of anything and so it's just like it's just like I think that there's an this is sounds woooo but this is what I think I think there's an energy to this movement around Maha and the more every part of the Coalition could just be like just trying to make it successful I hope you're right I to be honest I hope you're right and I could definit but but but but Jack like of course in a year you could be tweeting about how stupid I was and saying this is all my job to subvert it no it could definitely get subverted but like we're at the moment right now where I think there's a lot of optimism in the country so like I'm I'm just saying like you know the energy kind of dictates that too like like like I think a coalition came together and an energy on this issue came together that's more than the media understands like I actually think like a lot of people have been really woken up and I think the campaign Maha message was very positive like it was very like optimistic and I think if that could be translated into wins for president Trump and we can be like positive and organized and not immediately distrustful of course there's going to be decisions we don't fully support right it's like you know you know on the person but like like this is a team that's ready to execute the president Trump picked you know Bobby's in there nobody's controlling Bobby um you know there's a real sense of optimism and positivity and and and I got to say this there's a there's a desire to get ideas and thinking and big ideas from from everyone and I know you're talking to people it just you know it's very I'm not interested in the United States just so you know it's very imperfect it's very imperfect but it's like I don't have the interest like incentives dictate outcomes yeah my incentives aren't for the United States my friend when you're decentralized my interest are where marri's okay in the office with the patient and right now the number for that okay this this sit situation affected every single American right it's a gigantic problem and it's being swept under the rug that is why we are so riled up and so passionate and and and so mistrustful because it affected every American it didn't obviously affect I've shown where my heart is I've shown where my heart is I agree that affected you why because you got on a podcast and said I took 60 billion copies and I'm okay with it no no no no do say I'm okay with it no I'm saying you you're okay with it you rolled your sleeve up you complied I mean oh what I'm saying to you as a guy who's a lobbyist who knows how bad the actors are oh yeah yeah right oh if you want to get into my specific no I don't want to get into what I'm trying to say to you is to prove her Point that's how successful the propaganda was oh yeah yeah yeah yeah that's why this is an issue yeah for everybody in America right even CI means fell prey to this with your message I would think I would think that after this podcast that maybe you would reflect a little bit on that and say you know maybe I should have talked a little bit about this issue and what that means that one time like the the you know the saddest outome for this podcast I don't want no listen to me I I don't want to see what happened to your mom happened to you I certainly do not want that outcome for you and the thing is I need you to understand that that outcome based on Kevin mckernan science and confirmed by multiple Labs that's a real risk for Cali beans not a small risk a pretty big risk and you did a good job in this podcast saying yeah I'm not doing that again I'm not letting my family do that again so that's a good thing it means that you you took your punch in the mouth and learn the lesson but what you have to realize as the lobbyist talking to two doctors that our job is to advocate for our patience and when we see somebody floating more on the political side you need to understand where we're coming from well I I told I told you I know your heart and you know I'm I'm we've connected today I think I think you're I think we've made a bit conspiratorial but um but I think I think I am coming because it is super reasonable and I think it's high stakes and um where do where do we go from here I I don't you're going to go back to Trump and tell him that he needs to take the shot off the market Trump trump like like Casey has not even been involved with this I'm going to tell you the bare minimum this is what I would say for me I think that you need to talk about I think Danny needs to get you a copy of MCC Caron's so yeah and then what I'd really like for you to do is you stewing those tomatoes for a while and really understand what it means you have my commitment on that you have my commitment on that I I don't like this gun to my head of like telling me what my message should be you already got the gun to your head in fact you shot yourself in the brain and you don't because you took the job well well let me yeah let me be clear about this I think you can judge me for that this was right this actually try to I'm trying to tell you as a doctor that I don't really think you understand you're actually you're actually making me I mean it was evil my mom was gonna die in the you know protocols we weren't to see her we were getting pressured right after he died we were scared about seeing my dad and you know like like yeah it was like it was like a whole it was crazy and I think I'm just going to tell you the reason I brought up what I brought before your mother because you need to hear this you do need to look at the death certificate I guarantee you that Stanford no I'm going to tell you the reason say what you said you said don't worry about it know you have to your sister should do this and then get the EOB for your mother and you're going to find out that Stanford upcharged her oh yeah unbelievable amounts because of yeah so guess what that is something for you and your sister to set the we talk about that we talk about that well it's crazy you need to go look at it and then start asking the question what the also we've talked about Kevin mckernan quite a bit but I don't think we've really eluded so like the elevator pitch of like his background is he sort of blew the whistle on when he got his hands on some vials of the actual fiser vaccine and he discovered in his lab that there were DNA plasmid contamination inside not just that the sv40 promoter right and if you go look at the FDA it was never disclosed to the FDA so in fact it was taken out with a molecular tool so that the FDA couldn't find it right so the FDA never knew about this and then found out about it later and it turned out Kevin was the one that pointed it out that the evidence was actually in the data but they didn't right they didn't talk about it and Kevin is a super reasonable guy I mean he's got a really strong background in this stuff and DNA and Human Genome Project and he come he he has a very reasonable approach to this thing the way he lays it out it's very compelling and it's he's simply just stating data he's not like he has no he's not incentive right right good I you have Okay so let's W like you have my absolute commitment we are all on a journey I've been on a journey for years on this issue spurred by Casey's Journey like the rabbit hole goes deep everything should be questioned like if what you guys are saying is true which is is like you know this is this is Paradigm shifting crazy not crazy as in you guys are saying but like crazy information I mean I I don't I think it should be call I want want to say something to you said I hope you take this the right way you know why this is for me this is from a doctor to you yeah you have your mother's engines in you m your mother died at 71 years old and you took a jab that has 61 billion copies of sv40 in it do you know truly what that means because I don't think you do and I want your commitment that you're going to go home and learn about that and then when you learn about it and you find out that Mary and Uncle Jack ain't bullshitting you that you talk about that from your perspective not policy perspective not your wife's perspective not Casey's Callie's perspective about what it feels like Okay because I'm going to tell you I just spent a weekend with Nicole Shanahan and let me tell you something her perspective about what's happening to her right now and what she now knows and how sick she she's been over this very issue okay it's a big problem my friend so so Jack let me speak personally for me um there's massive growing suspicion in my head in everyone's head with the level of aisc and lies and Corruption that happened during including with the and what you're saying is super alarming um you have my commitment that I am going to review that and think about it really seriously that's it that's that's all I'm asking you to do and and and that's that's for me um nothing will surprise me and think one of the things I'm really optimistic about this time is that we can start asking questions and and talk and um and and and and and shift some paradigms you know and I think I think what we're talking about you know going against a you know unambiguous government recommendation there's huge forces to to to not have that conversation happening that I'm very skeptical of well you have to realize something that that Mary brought up earlier the shot that you took is now being retold in shots now now it's being retooled in other shots so guess what the data that Kevin's got you can't take another my friend because he the first one you took if you do you are basically rolling the dice just like your mom did well TR TR truly I I I mean if you if if we're a different place now Jack I mean I'd be open no I'm I'm just warning you as a doctor to a regular guy yeah that you need to consider this because guess what I think think the more this gets real for you personally then you're going to look at your wife you're going to look at your your children you're going to start looking at everybody around you a little bit more differently and you may realize why we're very concerned I feel I actually think that both of us care about you more than you care about you thank you uh you think so you're concerned about I I think it's 90% of the American people got at least one you're you're concerned about like yeah but the the interesting thing is where his family's from it was over 90% that's my concern I thought at least 90% got one at least one overall United States she's right it's around 75 but you're concerned about every single person that got well no I I I can tell you right now Kevin's data the things that we've been sharing him and I have been going back and forth for a long time this data is even worse than I thought that I think the problem now is I I you my commitment to look deeply into that for myself and it's obviously concerning and then I I I truly I hope you can see in my heart like want that data to get out and want you guys to be as successful as possible and I think it's criminal and You' have taken so many arrows Mary to you know speak your truth which is which is a disgrace and but just remember her truth is your truth now you've been informed thank you that you're now GMO guy that's the truth remember you when you say pharmaceutical stuff I hear you it's not a pharmaceutical it's gene therapy okay you are just like Monsanto now Jack I I'm with you I hear you do I mean do I not seem like an openminded person I want to make sure that that magnitude okay hit you so you understand why we're saying what we're saying I can see you have deep concern and they're saying that with concern and I and I hear you and I hear the seriousness of what you're saying listen thank you guys very much we just did three hours um I think that this is really important that we did this I think it was really cool that we all got together and got to some sort of consensus on or agreement whether we agree with each other's angles on approach or not it seems like we all have the same overall goals so again thank you Cali for coming I really appreciate it Mary and then Jack coming all the way from El Salvador to to do this I got to go Christmas shopping I know you do to Hash this out I think this is really important for the especially for the people that are listening to it so um it's all thanks thank you thanks Danny good night world
