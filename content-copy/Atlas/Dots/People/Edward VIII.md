# Edward VIII’s Relationships and Forced Abdication

## Relationship with [[Adolf Hitler]]

- Nazi Sympathies: In the What is Money? podcast, [[Jack Kruse, MD|Kruse]] asserts Edward VIII was a “card-carrying Nazi sympathizer” who aligned with [[Adolf Hitler]] to advance pro-German interests. He highlights Edward’s 1937 visit to Nazi Germany, where he and Wallis Simpson met Hitler at Berchtesgaden and dined with Nazi leaders like Joseph Goebbels and Hermann Göring, receiving royal honors. Kruse claims Edward shared sensitive information, such as French military weaknesses, to support Hitler’s regime, aiming to influence Anglo-German relations or regain power post-abdication.
    
- Elite Agenda: Kruse ties this to his broader narrative of elite manipulation, stating in his November 26, 2024, X post that the Fabian Society “created Hitler” to destabilize Europe for global restructuring. Edward’s Nazi ties were leveraged to facilitate this chaos, aligning with elite goals to orchestrate World War II.
    

## Relationship with the Rothschilds

- Financial Control: Kruse connects Edward VIII to the Rothschilds through their alleged dominance over global banking, echoing [[Theodore Silbert]]’s lesson from his early job interview: “If you control the issuance of money, you control the world.” In the podcast, Kruse claims the Rothschilds, as “banking-elites,” manipulated Edward’s actions by controlling financial systems, particularly through the Bank of England. He suggests they supported the [[1933 Transfer Agreement]], a supposed Nazi-[[Zionism|Zionist]] deal to facilitate Jewish emigration to Palestine, with Edward as a potential figurehead to advance [[Zionism|Zionist]] objectives in the Middle East.
    
- Power Dynamics: The Rothschilds, alongside the Fabians and [[Council of Foreign Relations|Council on Foreign Relations]] (CFR), used their financial influence to shape Edward’s role, ensuring his Nazi sympathies served their geopolitical agenda until they became a liability.
    

## Why Edward VIII Was Forced to Abdicate

- Cover-Up of Nazi Ties: In his April 19, 2025, X post, Kruse claims Edward’s 1936 abdication—officially due to his desire to marry Wallis Simpson—was a “smokescreen” orchestrated by British intelligence to hide his Nazi sympathies. The abdication prevented exposure of royal family ties to Hitler, which could have destabilized the British monarchy and elite control.
    
- Threat to Elite Plans: Kruse argues Edward’s pro-Nazi stance, including his potential to push a pro-German foreign policy, threatened the broader elite agenda of controlled geopolitical restructuring. The Fabians, Rothschilds, and British government removed Edward to neutralize his influence, ensuring the monarchy aligned with their financial and political goals, such as supporting [[Zionism]] and preparing for WWII.
    

## Broader Narrative and [[Bitcoin]] Connection

- Elite Control via Money: Kruse frames Edward’s abdication as evidence of elite power, with the Rothschilds and Fabians using money to manipulate geopolitics, per Silbert’s quote. In “[[These People Must Pay_Bitcoin Trump COVID and Zionism with Dr Jack|These People Must Pay]],” Kruse and Breedlove argue that centralized banking systems, like those controlled by the Rothschilds, enslave populations through debt, with Edward’s removal protecting this system.
    
- Bitcoin as Resistance: Kruse sees Bitcoin’s decentralized, fixed-supply nature as a counter to Rothschild-controlled banking, disrupting the elite financial power thatwings that forced Edward’s abdication. The podcast emphasizes Bitcoin’s role in resisting centralized control, aligning with Silbert’s lesson about money’s global influence.
