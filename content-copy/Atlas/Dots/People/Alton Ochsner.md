Dr. Alton Ochsner, a prominent surgeon at Tulane University and founder of the Ochsner Clinic, plays a significant role in [[Dr. Jack Kruse|Kruse]]’s narrative. Key points include:

- Role in Polio Vaccine and SV40: [[Jack Kruse, MD|Kruse]] portrays Ochsner as a central figure in both [[the Cutter Incident]] and the SV40 experiments. Ochsner, a supporter of the Salk vaccine, tragically injected his grandchildren with a tainted batch from Cutter Laboratories, resulting in his grandson’s death and his granddaughter contracting polio. Kruse uses this to highlight the personal consequences of the incident and Ochsner’s misplaced trust in the vaccine’s safety.
- SV40 Experiments and CIA Connections: Kruse alleges Ochsner was involved in the linear accelerator experiments with [[Mary Sherman]], under the guise of developing an SV40 vaccine but with the true aim of creating a bioweapon. He describes Ochsner as a staunch anti-communist and CIA asset, citing his leadership of the Information Council of the Americas (INCA) and connections to figures like [[Richard Nixon]] and Clint Murchison. Kruse suggests Ochsner’s work was part of a broader CIA agenda to weaponize viruses, potentially targeting Castro.
- Political and Social Influence: Kruse paints Ochsner as a politically connected figure whose conservative, anti-communist views aligned with elite agendas. He notes Ochsner’s ties to high-profile figures and his role in the Ochsner Medical Center, which received significant funding from donors like Murchison. Kruse frames Ochsner’s involvement in these events as evidence of medical professionals being co-opted by powerful interests.
