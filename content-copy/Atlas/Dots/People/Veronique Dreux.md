## First marriage to Serge Franch 
- No facts of note
## Second marriage to Jean-Michel Trogneux 1980-1987

- 1980 Wedding: Jean-Michel married Véronique Dru on November 24, 1980, in Blan Trv, with Brigitte as the sole witness. The union, announced post-event in L’Auver Pioné, occurred in “strictest privacy,” echoing Tiphaine’s description of André-Louis Auzière’s funeral.
- Children: The couple had Jean-Jacques Trogneux in 1982 (resembling Emmanuel) and Valérie Trogneux in 1984. Their 1987 divorce was followed by Véronique’s remarriage to Alain de la Simone in 1998, adopting a lavish lifestyle.

## Third marriage to Alain de la Simone

- This resulted in a major increase in lifestyle for Veronique.

## Véronique Dru’s Interview and Lies

- Xavier Poussard’s Contact: Journalist Xavier Poussard interviewed Véronique Dru, who dismissed rumors of Jean-Michel transitioning into Brigitte, citing two children (Jean-Jacques, Valérie) and no knowledge of Emmanuel until Valérie’s wedding. She claimed post-divorce life with her mother, but records show she lived in a Trogneux-owned Amiens apartment.
- Documentary Evidence: Véronique lied on a 1992 tax document (listing only Serge Franch as a prior husband) and a 2018 Corsica property document (claiming no prior marriages), indicating a pattern of concealing her marriage to Jean-Michel.
- Interruption: During the call, someone else’s presence stopped Véronique after she mentioned knowing Macron’s father, Jean-Michel Macron, adding intrigue about family suppression.
