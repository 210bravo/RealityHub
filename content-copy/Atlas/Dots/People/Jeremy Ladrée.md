## Background

- Family Connection: Jeremy Ladrée is the son of Mark Ladrée, a billionaire and close friend of Brigitte Macron. [[Candace Owens]] suggests this relationship ties Jeremy into the influential network surrounding the Macrons, implying a level of protection and privilege.
- Troubled Character: Owens portrays Jeremy as a figure with a criminal history, specifically highlighting his involvement in child pornography cases. She frames this as a scandalous detail that the Macrons and their associates sought to suppress.

## Timeline and Events

- 2008: Jeremy, as the former manager of a children’s entertainment company, was first convicted of child pornography offenses.
- 2015: Jeremy faced a second conviction for child pornography, which Owens claims was covered up by Mimi Marchand, the Macrons’ PR fixer, to protect the presidential couple’s image after Macron’s inauguration.
- 2024: A more recent incident occurred where the mother of Jeremy’s young children (aged three and one at the time) summoned police after discovering additional images on his computer. Investigators reportedly found 4,000 images of naked children being raped, leading to another conviction. Owens notes that Jeremy received a suspended eight-month sentence, which she criticizes as lenient.
- Media Suppression: Owens alleges that Mimi Marchand, who controlled Brigitte’s public image through her photo agency Best Image, intervened to keep Jeremy’s name and face out of the press, particularly after the 2015 conviction. This act of suppression is presented as a favor to Mark Ladrée, Jeremy’s father, and a point of contention that later strained the Macrons’ relationship with Marchand.

Owens’ Narrative

- Cover-Up Allegation: Owens suggests that the Macrons’ decision to distance themselves from Mimi Marchand after her involvement in covering up Jeremy’s scandals indicates their awareness of the damaging potential of these associations. She frames this as evidence of a broader pattern of manipulation and image control.
- Moral Outrage: Owens uses Jeremy’s story to underscore her claims of predatory behavior within the Macrons’ circle, linking it to her overarching theory that Brigitte Macron’s alleged transgender past and the couple’s rise to power involve corruption and suppression of truth.
- Legal and Public Fallout: The revelation of Jeremy’s repeated offenses is presented as a bombshell that Marchand’s actions could no longer contain, leading to the Macrons’ strategic retreat from her. Owens implies this incident contributed to the unraveling of the carefully curated narrative around Brigitte.

Critical PerspectiveOwens’ account relies heavily on speculation and lacks concrete evidence, such as court documents or independent verification of Jeremy’s convictions or the exact nature of the cover-up. The timeline and details (e.g., the number of images or sentence specifics) are presented assertively but appear to be based on her interpretation rather than substantiated records. The connection to the Macrons is circumstantial, hinging on Mark Ladrée’s friendship with Brigitte and Mimi Marchand’s PR role, which Owens uses to build her conspiracy narrative.This story, as told by Owens, serves as a supporting element in her broader attack on the Macrons, emphasizing alleged corruption and moral failings rather than providing a standalone, verified biography of Jeremy Ladrée.
