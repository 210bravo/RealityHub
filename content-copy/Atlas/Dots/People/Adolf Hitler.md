# [[Jack Kruse, MD|Jack Kruse]] Perspective:
### 1. Hitler as a “Foot Soldier” for Larger Powers:

- [[Dr. Jack Kruse|Kruse]] asserts that Hitler was not an independent actor but a “foot soldier for the monarchy” and a creation of elite groups, specifically the [[Fabian Society|Fabians]], a British socialist think tank that he claims influenced the Labour Party and global political movements. He suggests Hitler was a tool of these groups to advance their agendas, particularly financial control and the establishment of Israel.
- In the podcast, Kruse connects historical events like the Battle of Waterloo (1815) to [[WWII]], implying a long-standing pattern of manipulation by financial elites, particularly the [[Rothschilds|Rothschild]] family, to orchestrate global conflicts for profit and power. He suggests that [[WWII]] was a continuation of these financial machinations, with Hitler serving as a pawn in a larger geopolitical strategy.

### 3. Connections to the Royal Family:

- Kruse specifically links Hitler to the British royal family through [[Edward VIII]], claiming that intelligence agencies (British and Israeli) work to obscure this connection. He references the “[[1933 Transfer Agreement|transfer agreement]]” (likely the Haavara Agreement of 1933) as a downstream effect of this relationship, suggesting [[Edward VIII]]’s abdication was tied to efforts to conceal royal involvement with Hitler.
- The Haavara Agreement, which Kruse alludes to, was a real historical arrangement between Nazi Germany and [[Zionism|Zionist]] organizations to facilitate Jewish emigration from Germany to Palestine, transferring some assets in the process. Kruse frames this as evidence of collaboration between Hitler and [[Zionism|Zionist]] interests, orchestrated by higher powers like the British monarchy and bankers.

### 4. Role of Bankers and Financial Elites:

- Kruse repeatedly emphasizes the role of bankers, particularly the Rothschild family, in shaping global events, including [[WWII]]. In the podcast, he discusses the Rothschilds in connection to the Balfour Declaration (1917), which promised a Jewish homeland in Palestine, suggesting it was part of a broader financial strategy to control the Middle East.
- He claims that “the people that control big pharma are the bankers,” extending this to WWII by implying that financial elites manipulated Hitler to serve their interests, such as securing America as a global empire and establishing Israel as a strategic base in the oil-rich Middle East.
- Kruse’s narrative aligns with antisemitic conspiracy theories about the Rothschilds, which have been debunked as baseless tropes. He suggests that these bankers profited from artificial conflicts, including WWII, and used Hitler to achieve their goals, such as eliminating competition in industries like agribusiness (e.g., by promoting Zyklon B, the chemical used in gas chambers, as a pesticide).

### 5. Jews, Israel, and the Haavara Agreement:

- Kruse argues that the relocation of Jews to Israel was a deliberate strategy by financial and political elites, facilitated by the Haavara Agreement. He claims this was not about saving Jews but about securing Palestine as a base for Western interests in the Middle East, particularly for oil.
- He suggests that the narrative of Jewish persecution was exaggerated or manipulated to justify the creation of Israel, aligning with his broader claim that WWII was orchestrated to achieve geopolitical and financial objectives. This includes the idea that the “horrific genocide” narrative was used to garner sympathy for establishing a Jewish state.

### 6. Gas Chambers and Holocaust Denial/Minimization:

- While Kruse does not explicitly deny the Holocaust in the provided sources, he casts doubt on the conventional narrative by questioning the evidence for gas chambers. He aligns with revisionist claims, such as those by David Irving, who argue that the gas chambers at Auschwitz were not used for mass extermination or that the number of deaths was significantly lower than the widely accepted six million.
- Kruse suggests that the Holocaust narrative, particularly the use of gas chambers, is “poorly supported,” echoing claims that deaths in concentration camps were primarily due to disease or other causes rather than systematic gassing. He does not provide specific evidence in the podcast or X posts but relies on the broader revisionist framework that questions logistical feasibility and documentary proof.
- He ties this to his broader conspiracy, claiming that the Holocaust narrative was constructed to vilify Hitler excessively, thereby justifying Allied intervention and the creation of Israel.

### 7. Broader Context and Motivations:

- Kruse frames his narrative as a pursuit of truth against a backdrop of suppressed information, particularly in the United States, where he claims people are ready to question established narratives.
- He connects WWII to modern issues like COVID-19, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and medical corruption, suggesting that the same financial elites (bankers and intelligence agencies) continue to manipulate global events. This includes references to [[Donald Trump|Trump]] and Bobby Kennedy as figures challenging this system, though he expresses skepticism about their ability to dismantle it.

## Synthesis of the Narrative

Kruse’s narrative portrays Hitler as a manipulated figure, a “foot soldier” for the British monarchy, [[Fabian Society|Fabians]], and bankers like the [[Rothschilds]], who orchestrated WWII to secure financial and geopolitical goals, including the establishment of Israel as a Western outpost in the Middle East. He claims the [[Haavara Agreement]] facilitated Jewish relocation to serve these interests, not to save Jews, and questions the gas chamber narrative as part of an exaggerated Holocaust story designed to justify Allied actions and Israel’s creation. 

### To fact-check Kruse’s claims, consider the following:

- Hitler’s Autonomy: Historical evidence, including Hitler’s own writings in Mein Kampf and speeches (e.g., his 1939 Reichstag speech), confirms his ideological commitment to antisemitism and genocide, contradicting claims of him being a mere pawn.
- Royal Family Connection: The link to [[Edward VIII]] is speculative; the Haavara Agreement was a practical arrangement, not evidence of royal orchestration. [[Edward VIII]]’s pro-German sympathies are documented but lack direct ties to Hitler’s actions.
- Bankers and Rothschilds: Antisemitic conspiracy theories about the [[Rothschilds]] have been debunked (e.g., by The Independent and Britannica), with no credible evidence linking them to WWII’s causation.
- Gas Chambers: Extensive documentation, survivor testimonies, and Nazi records (e.g., from Auschwitz) confirm the use of gas chambers for mass extermination, refuting revisionist claims like those of David Irving or the Leuchter Report.
- Israel and [[Zionism]]: The Balfour Declaration and [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement predate WWII, driven by Jewish advocacy and geopolitical factors, not a banker-led conspiracy. The Holocaust accelerated Jewish immigration to Palestine, but Kruse’s claim of a premeditated elite plan lacks evidence.

## Conclusion

[[Dr. Jack Kruse]]’s narrative frames Hitler as a manipulated figure serving the interests of the British monarchy, [[Fabian Society|Fabians]], and bankers like the Rothschilds, with WWII orchestrated to secure financial control and establish Israel. He questions the gas chamber narrative and suggests the Holocaust was exaggerated to justify these outcomes.
