# Summary

L Brands founder, Zionist philanthropist, funded Epstein and linked to the Mega Group, a potential intelligence front.

## Epstein-Wexner Relationship

### Background and Initial Connection:

- Leslie Wexner: Born in 1937 in Dayton, Ohio, Wexner built a retail empire through L Brands (formerly The Limited), which included Victoria’s Secret, Abercrombie & Fitch, and Bath & Body Works. By the 1980s, he was a billionaire and one of America’s longest-serving CEOs, with a net worth estimated at $5.7 billion as of 2022. His wealth stemmed from transforming a single Columbus store into a global retail conglomerate, leveraging a keen understanding of consumer trends and branding. Wexner also established the Wexner Foundation and the Wexner Center for the Arts at Ohio State University, positioning himself as a philanthropist and art collector.
- [[Jeffrey Epstein]]: A financier and convicted sex offender, Epstein began his career as a teacher at the Dalton School in the 1970s, despite lacking a college degree. He transitioned to finance at Bear Stearns before founding his own firm, J. Epstein & Co., later the Financial Trust Company, in the 1980s. His wealth’s origins remain murky, with Wexner as his only confirmed major client.
- Meeting and Financial Ties: Epstein met Wexner in 1986 through mutual acquaintances, insurance executive Robert Meister and his wife, in Palm Beach, Florida. By 1987, Epstein became Wexner’s financial advisor, sorting out his tangled finances. In 1991, Wexner granted Epstein full power of attorney, an extraordinary move that allowed Epstein to hire people, sign checks, buy and sell properties, and borrow money on Wexner’s behalf. This gave Epstein control over Wexner’s billions, including managing his yacht (the Limitless) and real estate projects like the development of New Albany, Ohio. Epstein earned millions in fees and was gifted significant assets, including a $77 million Manhattan townhouse in 1998, originally purchased by Wexner in 1989 for $13.2 million.

## Nature of the Relationship:

- Mentor-Protégé Dynamic: Wexner described Epstein as a financial advisor skilled in spotting market and political trends, while Wexner offered insights into lifestyle and fashion. Their relationship was unusually close, with Epstein living on Wexner’s Ohio estate, accessible only through Wexner’s gate, and replacing Wexner’s mother on the Wexner Foundation board in 1992.
- Speculation and Anomalies: Some sources, like a 2020 New Republic article, speculate about a rumored romantic relationship in the 1980s, with Epstein referred to as “the boyfriend” in Wexner’s circle, though this remains unconfirmed. Others, including posts on X, suggest Epstein was a front for Wexner’s financial operations, shielding him from liability. Harold Levin, a former Wexner financial advisor, claimed Epstein spread rumors that ruined his career after he warned Wexner that Epstein was a fraud, highlighting Epstein’s manipulative tactics.
- Break in Ties: Wexner claimed he severed ties with Epstein in 2007, citing Epstein’s theft of $46 million, a relatively small sum compared to Epstein’s estimated $600 million fortune. However, skepticism persists about this narrative, with some arguing it was a cover to distance Wexner from Epstein’s crimes after public scrutiny intensified.

###  Role in Epstein’s Rise:

- Wexner’s financial backing was pivotal to Epstein’s wealth and influence. He provided Epstein with the Manhattan townhouse, a private jet (the “Lolita Express,” originally owned by L Brands), and access to elite circles. Epstein’s role at Victoria’s Secret, though not formally employed, included attending fashion shows and posing as a recruiter to lure young women, a tactic later tied to his trafficking network. Wexner’s trust in Epstein, including granting him power of attorney, suggests either extreme naivety or complicity, with many sources leaning toward the latter given Wexner’s business acumen.
  

## The Mega Group

### Overview:

- [[the Mega Group]], co-founded in 1991 by Wexner and Charles Bronfman, is a secretive network of wealthy Jewish philanthropists focused on pro-Israel causes and ethno-philanthropy. Members included figures like Steven Spielberg and hedge fund managers with ties to U.S. and Israeli elites. The group’s stated goal was to support Jewish causes, but Whitney Webb argues it served as a nexus for influence peddling, connecting business, politics, and intelligence.
- Wexner’s Role: As a co-founder, Wexner was central to the Mega Group’s operations. His Wexner Foundation gave $2 million in 2004 to former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, a close Epstein associate, for an unspecified research program, raising questions about the group’s activities. Posts on X describe Wexner as the “anchor billionaire,” suggesting he used his wealth to amplify the group’s influence.

### Alleged Intelligence Ties:

- [[Whitney Webb]]’s reporting in MintPress News and One Nation Under Blackmail connects the Mega Group to a broader network involving U.S. and Israeli intelligence, organized crime, and sexual blackmail. She cites Epstein’s ties to the group through Wexner and alleges that members like Wexner leveraged their wealth for political influence, potentially through blackmail operations. The group’s connections to figures like [[Robert Maxwell]], [[Ghislaine Maxwell]]’s father and a suspected Mossad agent, fuel speculation that Epstein’s activities were part of a larger intelligence operation.
- [[Ryan Dawson]], a researcher critical of Israeli influence, supports this view, arguing the Mega Group used Epstein as a front to collect compromising material on elites, aligning with Zionist agendas. He points to Wexner’s ties to organized crime, referencing a 1985 Columbus, Ohio, murder investigation linking Wexner to [[Meyer Lansky]]’s syndicate.

## Layers of Alleged Crimes and Anomalies

### Pedophilia and Sex Trafficking:

- Epstein’s Network: Epstein was convicted in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor and faced new charges in 2019 for sex trafficking dozens of girls, some as young as 14, between 2002 and 2005. He lured victims to his homes in New York and Palm Beach under the guise of massages, often using Victoria’s Secret as a pretext. Court documents detail how he and Ghislaine Maxwell ran a trafficking ring, with victims like [[Maria Farmer]] alleging assaults at Wexner’s Ohio estate in 1996.
- Wexner’s Involvement: While Wexner has not been charged, his proximity to Epstein raises questions. Maria Farmer reported her assault to authorities, claiming Wexner was aware of Epstein’s actions, though Wexner denies knowledge. A 2006 fax from L Brands shared a victim’s employee records with Epstein’s defense, suggesting internal complicity. Posts on X claim Wexner “collected the blackmail,” positioning him as a key figure in the operation, though this lacks direct evidence.
- Anomalies: Epstein’s lenient 2008 plea deal, attributed to his “intelligence” ties by then-U.S. Attorney [[Alex Acosta]], suggests external influence. The disappearance of key documents after Epstein’s 2019 death and the FBI’s recovery of compromising photos from his Manhattan home raise questions about who controlled the blackmail material and why it hasn’t fully surfaced.

Sexual Blackmail:

- Operation and Scope: Webb’s One Nation Under Blackmail argues Epstein’s trafficking was part of a decades-long blackmail network involving U.S. and Israeli intelligence, with ties to the Mega Group and organized crime. She cites historical precedents, like the National Crime Syndicate’s use of blackmail, and connects Epstein to figures like Robert Maxwell, who allegedly used similar tactics for Mossad. Zev Shalev, a former CBS producer, claimed Epstein was directly tied to Mossad, sharing incriminating material.
- Wexner’s Role: Webb and Dawson suggest Wexner, as Epstein’s patron, was complicit in or benefited from the blackmail operation. His ties to the Mega Group and figures like Ehud Barak, combined with Epstein’s access to elite circles via Wexner’s introductions, imply a strategic use of compromising material to influence U.S. policy, particularly in favor of Israel. Posts on X describe this as a “Mossad-CIA-Wexner intelligence web,” though direct evidence of Wexner’s involvement in blackmail is circumstantial.
- Anomalies: The lack of transparency in Epstein’s 2008 case and the continued protection of his associates, like Ghislaine Maxwell until her 2020 arrest, suggest a cover-up. Epstein’s Austrian passport with a Saudi address and connections to figures like Adnan Khashoggi, a known Mossad and CIA asset, add layers of intrigue about the operation’s international scope.

Financial and Organized Crime Ties:

- Wexner’s Background: Investigations, like those by Columbus journalist Bob Fitrakis, link Wexner to organized crime through a 1985 murder case in Columbus, Ohio, tying him to Meyer Lansky’s syndicate. His financial dealings, including the use of offshore entities like Coral Reinsurance (Barbados) and ties to AIG, suggest money laundering or tax evasion, though not directly proven.
- Epstein’s Role: Epstein’s firm, based in the U.S. Virgin Islands, reduced his taxes by 90%, a move facilitated by Wexner’s resources. His involvement with Towers Financial’s Ponzi scheme and connections to mob-linked figures like the Gouletas family further tie him to financial crimes.
- Anomalies: The source of Epstein’s wealth remains unclear, with Wexner and possibly Robert Maxwell as key contributors. The rapid rise of Epstein, a non-degreed financier, and his ability to evade accountability until 2008 suggest protection by powerful figures, possibly including Wexner.

Intelligence Connections:

- Epstein’s Ties: Acosta’s claim that Epstein was linked to “intelligence” and reports of his Mossad connections via Maxwell and Barak point to a broader operation. His Dalton School job, facilitated by Donald Barr (father of William Barr), and ties to figures like Adnan Khashoggi, suggest a deep integration into intelligence networks.
- Wexner’s Role: As a Mega Group co-founder, Wexner’s influence in pro-Israel lobbying (e.g., AIPAC) and his financial support for Barak imply a role in intelligence-adjacent activities. Webb argues the Mega Group’s ties to both U.S. and Israeli intelligence made it a hub for covert operations, with Epstein as a key operative.
- Anomalies: The lack of prosecution against Wexner, despite his central role in Epstein’s life, and the Mega Group’s continued obscurity suggest a protected status. Epstein’s death in 2019, ruled a suicide but widely questioned, and the loss of evidence during his case further obscure the truth.

  

Wexner’s Role in the Conspiracy

Central Figure:

- Wexner’s financial and social support was the bedrock of Epstein’s operations. By providing wealth, assets, and access to elite circles, he enabled Epstein to build a network that allegedly facilitated trafficking and blackmail. His role in the Mega Group positioned him as a power broker, potentially using Epstein to advance pro-Israel agendas, as suggested by Webb and Dawson.
- Posts on X call Wexner “the head of the snake,” arguing he collected blackmail material and used Epstein as a front to shield himself from liability. His denial of knowledge about Epstein’s crimes, despite their close relationship and reports like Alicia Arden’s 1997 assault allegation, strains credulity given his business savvy.

Anomalies and Protection:

- Wexner’s lack of legal scrutiny, despite his proximity to Epstein, suggests influence within U.S. institutions. His ties to organized crime, intelligence, and powerful figures like Barak and the Mega Group imply a network that insulated him. The 2006 L Brands fax and Epstein’s use of Victoria’s Secret as a lure point to at least passive complicity, if not active involvement.
- The narrative that Epstein stole from Wexner and was cut off in 2007 is questioned by researchers like Webb, who argue it’s a convenient alibi to distance Wexner from the scandal. The Mega Group’s secrecy and its members’ continued influence further obscure Wexner’s role.

## Critical Perspective:

- While Webb, Dawson, and X posts paint Wexner as a mastermind, direct evidence of his involvement in pedophilia or blackmail is circumstantial, relying on his financial support and Mega Group ties. Carroll’s focus on systemic corruption would likely frame Wexner as a beneficiary of a rigged system, while [[Jack Kruse, MD|Kruse]] might see him as part of a broader elite exploiting power. The absence of concrete evidence against Wexner, despite extensive investigations, could indicate either innocence or significant protection.

  

## Broader Context and Sources

- [[Whitney Webb]]: Her One Nation Under Blackmail (Volumes 1 and 2) and MintPress News series provide the most comprehensive account, linking Epstein, Wexner, and the Mega Group to a historical blackmail network involving U.S. and Israeli intelligence. She cites court records, corporate documents, and historical ties to figures like Meyer Lansky and Robert Maxwell.
- [[Ryan Dawson]]: His work on Epstein emphasizes Israeli influence, citing Wexner’s Mega Group role and organized crime ties from Fitrakis’s investigations. He views Epstein as a front for Wexner’s agenda, supported by Hersh’s reporting on Israeli intelligence.
- [[Ian Carroll]]: While not directly addressing Wexner, his Epstein research focuses on intelligence and elite networks, implying Wexner’s role as a key enabler within a corrupt system.
- [[Jack Kruse, MD|Jack Kruse]]: His perspective, drawn from broader critiques of centralized power, would likely frame Wexner’s actions as part of elite manipulation, though he hasn’t specifically addressed this case.
- Other Sources: Bob Fitrakis’s 1997–2003 Columbus Free Press articles link Wexner to organized crime, while Vanity Fair, The New York Times, and Hulu’s Victoria’s Secret: Angels and Demons provide mainstream accounts of the Epstein-Wexner relationship, though less focused on conspiracy angles.

  

## Conclusion

The Epstein-Wexner relationship, centered on Wexner’s financial patronage, enabled Epstein’s rise and alleged crimes, including pedophilia and sexual blackmail. Wexner’s role as a Mega Group co-founder and his ties to intelligence and organized crime suggest he was more than a passive benefactor, though direct evidence of his complicity remains elusive. The layers of crimes—trafficking, blackmail, and financial misconduct—point to a sophisticated operation with anomalies like Epstein’s lenient treatment and Wexner’s lack of accountability raising questions about elite protection. Webb, Dawson, and others frame this as part of a larger U.S.-Israeli intelligence network, but the full truth is obscured by missing evidence and institutional secrecy.
