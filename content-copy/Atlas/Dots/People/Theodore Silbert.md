## Lessons from Silbert and Connection to Money, Bitcoin, and [[Jack Kruse, MD|Kruse]]’s Narrative

### 1. Professional Presentation as Trust in Financial Systems

- Lesson: A polished appearance builds trust, essential for financial interactions. Silbert’s investment in [[Dr. Jack Kruse|Kruse]]’s attire taught that credibility underpins economic exchanges.        
- Podcast Context: In “[[These People Must Pay_Bitcoin Trump COVID and Zionism with Dr Jack|These People Must Pay]],” Kruse and Breedlove discuss money as a trust-based ledger manipulated by elites (e.g., Fabians, central banks). Silbert’s lesson highlights the need for perceived reliability, which Kruse sees as exploited by centralized systems to maintain control.
- [[Bitcoin]] and Narrative Tie: Kruse champions Bitcoin’s trustless blockchain, which eliminates reliance on elite-controlled institutions like banks. He views centralized trust, exemplified by Silbert’s banking world, as a mechanism for power consolidation, which Bitcoin disrupts by enabling transparent, decentralized transactions.
        
### 2. Conservative Discipline for Financial Control
   - Lesson: Silbert’s “fortress balance sheet” approach—avoiding risky loans, maintaining low delinquency—taught disciplined decision-making for stability.
   - Podcast Context: Kruse cites Silbert’s quote, “If you control the issuance of money, you control the world,” to argue that central banks like the Federal Reserve use fiat currency to enslave populations through debt. In the podcast, he links this to the [[Fabian Society]]’s alleged financialization agenda, creating crises like COVID to entrench control.
   - Bitcoin and Narrative Tie: Bitcoin’s fixed 21-million-coin supply mirrors Silbert’s caution, offering a stable alternative to inflationary fiat. Kruse sees Bitcoin as a tool to resist elite power, aligning with his narrative that centralized money fuels geopolitical manipulations (e.g., [[Zionism]], [[Donald Trump|Trump]] policies).
        
### 3. Mentorship and Navigating Power Structures

- Lesson: Silbert’s reliance on experienced advisors taught Kruse to seek wisdom to understand complex systems like finance.
- Podcast Context: Kruse and Breedlove critique centralized science and finance, arguing elites hide knowledge to maintain power. Silbert’s mentorship showed Kruse the value of insider understanding, which he applies to expose centralized control in health and money systems.
- Bitcoin and Narrative Tie: Bitcoin’s open-source nature democratizes financial knowledge, bypassing elite gatekeepers. Kruse’s self-education, inspired by Silbert, fuels his advocacy for decentralized systems to counter [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] and [[Council of Foreign Relations|CFR]] agendas.
        
### 4. Philanthropy as Responsible Wealth Use

- Lesson: Silbert’s charitable work (e.g., Jewish Association for Services for the Aged) taught that wealth should serve society, not just personal gain.
- Podcast Context: Kruse argues elites hoard money to perpetuate control, citing COVID policies and vaccine profits. Silbert’s philanthropy contrasts with this greed, showing money’s potential for good.
- Bitcoin and Narrative Tie: Bitcoin empowers individuals to control wealth, aligning with Silbert’s ethos of social responsibility. Kruse sees it as a way to resist the medical-industrial complex and centralized power, redirecting resources to public good.
        
### 5. Resilience from Modest Beginnings

- Lesson: Silbert’s rise from a $1,000 Depression-era stake to bank chairman taught that persistence can transform limited resources into success.
- Podcast Context: Kruse and Breedlove define money as stored energy, manipulated by elites to limit individual potential. Silbert’s journey showed money’s power to create opportunity when used wisely.
- Bitcoin and Narrative Tie: Bitcoin’s accessibility allows anyone to build wealth outside elite systems, echoing Silbert’s resilience. Kruse ties this to resisting centralized control, including alleged [[Zionism|Zionist]] and COVID-related agendas.
        

## Broader Implications in Kruse’s Narrative

In “[[These People Must Pay_Bitcoin Trump COVID and Zionism with Dr Jack|These People Must Pay]],” Kruse frames money as a tool of elite domination, with Silbert’s quote, “If you control the issuance of money, you control the world,” as evidence of centralized power. He connects Silbert’s lessons—discipline, trust, resilience—to his critique of the [[Fabian Society]], [[Council of Foreign Relations|CFR]], and centralized systems (e.g., banking, healthcare) that manipulate money and health for control. Bitcoin, as a decentralized, fixed-supply currency, counters this by empowering individuals, aligning with Kruse’s view of resisting globalist agendas (e.g., COVID policies, [[Zionism]]). Silbert’s mentorship inspired Kruse’s mission to expose these structures, advocating decentralized solutions in health (circadian biology) and finance (Bitcoin) to reclaim power from elites.
