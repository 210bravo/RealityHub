 Early in the series, Owens suggests that André-Louis Auzière, portrayed as Brigitte Macron's first husband, may not have existed as a real person or may have been a fabricated figure to support a cover-up. Later on she concludes that he did definitively exist, however there are many oddities around the lack of photos, lack of career information and inconsistencies regarding his death. The funeral occurs quickly and with the utmost privacy. His daughter [[Tiphaine Choteau (Auziere)|Tiphaine Auzière]] changes her wording around whether he was berried or cremated. And there are rumors that he ended up in a psych ward guarded by [[Alexandre Benalla]]

- 1951 (Speculated Birth): Owens does not provide a specific birth date but references sources suggesting André-Louis Auzière was born around this time, aligning with the official narrative that he was of an age to marry Brigitte in the 1970s. She casts doubt on this, suggesting it might be a fabricated detail.
- 1974 (Alleged Marriage): Owens cites the official claim that André-Louis Auzière married Brigitte Trogneux on June 22, 1974, and that they had three children: Sébastien (1975), Laurence (1977), and Tiphaine (1984). She questions the authenticity of this marriage, pointing to the scarcity of photos or records, including a wedding photo that she claims does not resemble Brigitte.
- 1990s (Alleged Decline): Owens suggests that during this period, as Brigitte’s relationship with [[Emmanuel Macron]] developed, the narrative of André-Louis Auzière began to fade. She implies he was either removed from public view or never existed, with the couple’s story manipulated to present Brigitte as a divorcée.
- 2006 (Alleged Divorce): The official timeline states Brigitte divorced André-Louis Auzière in January 2006. Owens disputes this, arguing it’s part of the constructed backstory, with no concrete evidence of his life post-divorce or his role as a father.
- 2019 (Alleged Death): Owens references reports, such as those from [[Tiphaine Choteau (Auziere)|Tiphaine Auzière]] in Paris Match, claiming André-Louis Auzière died on December 24, 2019, and was buried privately. She highlights inconsistencies, like differing dates (e.g., incineration on December 28) and the lack of media coverage, suggesting this might be a fabricated event to close the narrative. She also mentions allegations of him being confined in a psychiatric clinic under surveillance, possibly by figures like Alexandre Benalla, adding to the mystery.

Journalists Natasha Ray and Amandine Roy incorrectly identified [[Jean-Louis Auzière]], André-Louis’s cousin, as the groom in a wedding photo, suggesting he was Brigitte Macron’s late husband, André-Louis Auzière. This mistake occurred during their investigation into the Becoming Brigitte conspiracy theory, with the misidentification published around 2019. Jean-Louis Auzière sued both journalists for defamation, with the Élysée Palace initially appearing to support the suit but later withdrawing, leaving Jean-Louis to pursue it independently. The legal case concluded in 2020, with Natasha Ray found liable, ordered to pay damages, while Amandine Roy settled out of court, highlighting the sensitivity of identity claims surrounding the Macron family.

The man in the photo above was suggested to be Brigitte's first husband André-Louis Auzière, but it seems more likely that this is Mr. Hugo. A teacher working at the same school as Brigitte.
