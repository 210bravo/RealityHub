# Expanded Chronology of Centralization and Control (1776–2020s)

## 1776–1810s: Foundations of Financial and Political Control

- 1776: Establishment of the United States: The Declaration of Independence marks the U.S. as a sovereign nation, but financial dependence on European bankers, including Jewish banking families like the [[Rothschilds]], shapes early economic policy. The [[Rothschilds]], operating through London and Frankfurt, begin extending loans to the fledgling nation, as noted by [[Whitney Webb|Webb]].  
      
    
- 1781–1789: [[First Bank of the United States]] (Planning): [[Alexander Hamilton]], influenced by European banking models, advocates for a central bank. Jewish bankers in London, such as Moses Montefiore and the [[Rothschilds]], indirectly shape British financial support for the U.S., pushing for centralized control to secure war debts from the Revolutionary War.  
      
    
- 1791–1811: [[First Bank of the United States]]: Chartered with a 20-year term, the bank centralizes U.S. currency and credit, modeled on the Bank of England. Critics like [[Thomas Jefferson]] warn of elite control by foreign bankers, including [[Rothschilds|Rothschild]] affiliates, who hold significant shares. The bank’s charter expires in 1811 amid public distrust.  
      
    
- 1800s: Early Artificial Lighting Experiments: Gas lighting emerges in urban centers, pioneered by figures like William Murdoch. While less disruptive than later electric lights, it begins altering circadian rhythms, a precursor to health impacts noted by [[Dr. Jack Kruse|Kruse]].  
      
    
- 1812–1815: War of 1812 and British Involvement: Jewish banking interests in London, including Nathan Mayer [[Rothschilds|Rothschild]], finance Britain’s war efforts against the U.S., profiting from loans and trade disruptions. The war strengthens calls for a second central bank to stabilize the economy.  
- 
      
    
- 1816–1836: [[Second Bank of the United States]]: Chartered to manage war debts, the bank is backed by European financiers, including the [[Rothschilds]], who exert influence through agents like Nicholas Biddle. President [[Andrew Jackson]] opposes it, calling it a tool of foreign elites, and vetoes its recharter in 1832, leading to its dissolution by 1836.  
      
    
- 1810s: [[Rothschilds|Rothschild]] Global Expansion: The [[Rothschilds|Rothschild]] family establishes banking houses across Europe (London, Paris, Frankfurt, Vienna, Naples), consolidating control over international finance. Their influence over U.S. banking, as critiqued by [[Ian Carroll|Carroll]], sets the stage for later centralization.  
      
    

## 1820s–1860s: Financial Manipulation and Geopolitical Shifts

- 1820s–1830s: Gas Lighting Proliferation: Gas streetlights spread in cities like Philadelphia and London, increasing nighttime activity and subtly disrupting melatonin production, as later emphasized by [[Dr. Jack Kruse|Kruse]].  
      
    
- 1837–1860s: [[Rothschilds]] and U.S. Finance: After the Second Bank’s collapse, [[Rothschilds|Rothschild]] agents like August Belmont fund U.S. infrastructure (e.g., railroads) and government bonds, maintaining elite influence over a decentralized banking system, as detailed by [[Whitney Webb|Webb]].  
      
    
- 1861–1865: U.S. Civil War and Russian Navy Support: The [[Rothschilds]] and other Jewish bankers in London and Paris finance both Union and Confederate sides, profiting from war bonds. Britain and France, under [[Rothschilds|Rothschild]] influence, consider intervening for the Confederacy to secure cotton trade. Tsar Alexander II sends Russian naval fleets to New York and San Francisco in 1863 to deter European intervention, supporting [[Abraham Lincoln]]’s Union. This act, as noted by Cooper, creates tensions with European elites.  
      
    
- 1863: National Banking Act: [[Abraham Lincoln]], wary of foreign bankers, establishes a national banking system to fund the war, issuing “greenbacks” free of [[Rothschilds|Rothschild]]-controlled debt. This defiance, per [[Ian Carroll|Carroll]], contributes to elite animosity toward [[Abraham Lincoln]].  
      
    
- 1865: [[Abraham Lincoln]]’s Assassination: John Wilkes Booth’s killing of [[Abraham Lincoln]] is speculated by some, including [[Ian Carroll|Carroll]], to involve banking elites angered by [[Abraham Lincoln]]’s monetary policies and Russian alliance. The Russian navy’s role indirectly ties to later U.S.-Russia tensions.  
      
    
- 1860s: Early Electromagnetic Experiments: Scientists like Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell lay the groundwork for electromagnetic theory, influencing later [[Non-Native Electromagnetic Fields|nnEMF]] technologies. These discoveries, while academic, attract elite interest for potential control applications.  
      
    

## 1870s–1890s: Industrialization and Elite Consolidation

- 1870s: Incandescent Lighting Emerges: Thomas Edison and others develop early electric bulbs, backed by financiers like JP Morgan. Artificial light disrupts circadian rhythms further, setting the stage for chronic health issues, as warned by [[Dr. Jack Kruse|Kruse]].  
      
    
- 1873: Panic of 1873: A financial crisis, exacerbated by speculative railroad investments and [[Rothschilds|Rothschild]]-linked banking manipulations, consolidates wealth among elites like Morgan and [[Rockefeller]], as analyzed by [[Whitney Webb|Webb]].  
      
    
- 1880s–1890s: Tesla’s Innovations: Nikola Tesla develops alternating current (AC) and experiments with wireless energy transmission. JP Morgan funds Tesla’s early work but withdraws support by the 1890s, fearing free energy would undermine monopolies, as noted by [[Ian Carroll|Carroll]].  
      
    
- 1893: Panic of 1893: Another financial crisis, potentially orchestrated by banking elites, weakens independent banks, paving the way for centralized banking reforms, per [[Whitney Webb|Webb]]’s research.  
      
    
- 1890s: [[Rothschilds]] and [[Zionism]]: The [[Rothschilds|Rothschild]] family supports early Zionist movements, funding Jewish settlements in Palestine, laying groundwork for the [[Balfour Declaration]], as discussed by Cooper.

- 1900–1910: Tesla vs. JP Morgan: Tesla’s Wardenclyffe Tower project, aimed at wireless energy, is abandoned after Morgan cuts funding in 1903, prioritizing corporate control over energy, as highlighted by [[Ian Carroll|Carroll]].  
      
    
- 1907: Panic of 1907: A manufactured crisis, per [[Whitney Webb|Webb]], orchestrated by Morgan and [[Rothschilds|Rothschild]] allies, justifies calls for a central bank. Morgan’s intervention stabilizes markets, boosting his influence.  
      
    
- 1910: Jekyll Island Meeting: Bankers, including Paul Warburg and Nelson Aldrich, secretly draft the [[Federal Reserve]] Act, representing [[Rothschilds|Rothschild]] and Morgan interests, as detailed by G. Edward Griffin and [[Whitney Webb|Webb]].  
      
    
- 1912: [[Titanic]] Sinking: The disaster kills [[Federal Reserve]] opponents (John Jacob Astor, Benjamin Guggenheim, Isidor Straus), fueling speculation, per [[Ian Carroll|Carroll]], of an elite plot to secure the central bank.  
      
    
- 1913: [[Federal Reserve]] Established: The [[Federal Reserve]] Act creates a private central bank, granting [[Rothschilds]], Morgans, and Rockefellers control over U.S. money supply, as critiqued by [[Whitney Webb|Webb]].  
      
    
- 1914–1918: World War I: [[Rothschilds|Rothschild]] banks finance both Allies and Central Powers, profiting massively. Their influence secures the 1917 [[Balfour Declaration]], promising a Jewish homeland in Palestine, per Cooper.  
      
    
- 1917: [[Balfour Declaration]]: British support for Zionism, driven by [[Rothschilds|Rothschild]] pressure, sets the stage for Israel’s establishment, as noted by [[Whitney Webb|Webb]].  
      
    
- 1919: Treaty of Versailles: Harsh reparations on Germany, influenced by [[Rothschilds|Rothschild]]-linked financiers, create economic chaos, enabling [[Adolf Hitler]]’s rise, per Cooper.

## Tying in Nicholas II’s Death

The Russian navy’s support for [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1863 strained Russia’s relations with [[Rothschilds|Rothschild]]-influenced Britain and France, who favored the Confederacy. This tension persisted, contributing to Anglo-Russian rivalry. By 1917, the Bolshevik Revolution, partially funded by Western bankers including [[Rothschilds|Rothschild]] affiliates, overthrew Tsar Nicholas II. His execution in 1918, as speculated by Cooper, was partly revenge for Russia’s historical defiance of European banking elites, tying back to [[Abraham Lincoln]]’s era.
