Proton tunneling is a quantum mechanical process central to mitochondrial function and cellular energy production. It refers to the ability of protons (H⁺ ions) to "tunnel" through energy barriers in the electron transport chain (ETC) and ATP synthase within mitochondria, rather than moving classically over these barriers. This phenomenon leverages quantum effects due to the small mass of protons, allowing them to behave as both particles and waves.

## Key Points:

- **Mitochondrial Context:** In the ETC, protons are pumped across the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), creating a proton motive force (PMF). Proton tunneling enhances the efficiency of this process, particularly in ATP synthase, where protons pass through the F₀ subunit to drive ATP production.
    
- **Quantum Efficiency:** Tunneling allows protons to bypass high-energy barriers, increasing the speed and precision of energy transfer. [[Jack Kruse, MD|Kruse]] suggests this is critical for maintaining the PMF and optimizing ATP synthesis.
    
- **Deuterium’s Role:** Deuterium (a heavier isotope of hydrogen) disrupts proton tunneling due to its greater mass, slowing quantum tunneling and reducing mitochondrial efficiency. Kruse advocates for [[Deuterium-Depleted Water]] (DDW) to minimize this interference.
    
- **Biological Implications:** Efficient proton tunneling supports high-fidelity cellular processes like myelination and bioelectric signaling. Disruptions (e.g., from toxins or circadian misalignment) lead to diseases like demyelination or cancer.
	
- Speculative Extensions: Kruse’s analogy to arc welding and concepts like “quantum stoichiometry” or the “somatocognitive action network (SCAN)” are not grounded in mainstream science. His emphasis on light-driven biology (e.g., photobiomodulation, circadian alignment) and paramagnetic effects goes beyond established evidence.
    

Jack Kruse’s theories on proton tunneling incorporate some mainstream concepts (e.g., quantum tunneling in proton transfer, kinetic isotope effects) but significantly diverge by amplifying tunneling’s role, introducing speculative frameworks (e.g., quantum stoichiometry, SCAN), and making unverified claims about DDW and disease causation. While his ideas align with emerging quantum biology research in principle, they lack empirical support and overgeneralize quantum effects beyond what mainstream science accepts. For a rigorous understanding, mainstream sources like peer-reviewed studies on mitochondrial bioenergetics or quantum biology provide a more grounded perspective.
