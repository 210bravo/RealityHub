[[Robert O Becker]], an orthopedic surgeon and pioneer in bioelectromagnetism, demonstrated that living organisms generate and respond to direct current (DC) electric fields at picoampere (10⁻¹² A) to nanoampere (10⁻⁹ A) scales. These minute currents, often referred to as the “current of injury,” are critical for biological processes like wound healing and tissue regeneration. Key findings from Becker’s work include:

- Bioelectric Potentials: Becker mapped electric potentials across organisms, noting that the body’s central regions are typically positively charged, while limbs are negatively charged. Upon injury (e.g., limb amputation in salamanders), a measurable voltage shift occurs at the wound site, from approximately -10 mV to +20 mV, known as the current of injury. In regenerative species like salamanders, this voltage shifts to -30 mV over weeks, facilitating limb regrowth, whereas in non-regenerative species like frogs, it reverts to baseline without regeneration.

- Regeneration and Dedifferentiation: Becker found that applying low-level DC currents (pico- to nanoampere range) or silver ions via iontophoresis could stimulate dedifferentiation of mature cells into stem-like states, forming a blastema—a mass of progenitor cells capable of regenerating tissues. This was observed in amphibians, rats, and limited human applications (e.g., wound healing with silver electrodes).

- Silver Iontophoresis: Becker’s patented technique (U.S. patent 70005556) used electrically generated silver ions to promote antibiotic effects and tissue regeneration, likely by inducing dedifferentiation through bioelectric signals. This method showed promise in healing chronic wounds and even regenerating tissues like bone and skin in clinical settings.

- Electromagnetic Concerns: Becker also warned about the harmful effects of artificial electromagnetic fields (EMFs), suggesting they could disrupt these delicate bioelectric signals, potentially affecting health and regeneration.

Becker’s work focused on DC currents rather than frequency-specific stimulation, distinguishing it from other electromedicine approaches. His research suggested that these pico/nano currents act as a primitive control system, orchestrating cellular behavior during healing by altering membrane potentials and guiding cell differentiation.

[[Jack Kruse, MD|Dr. Jack Kruse]]’s InterpretationKruse builds on Becker’s findings, integrating them into a broader biophysical and evolutionary framework that emphasizes photo-bioelectric signaling, circadian rhythms, and mitochondrial function. He posits that Becker’s pico/nano currents are not merely electrical but are intricately tied to light-driven processes involving melanin, cytochrome c oxidase (CCO), and deuterium-depleted water (DDW). Below is a breakdown of Kruse’s perspective as it relates to Becker’s currents:

1. Pico/Nano Currents as Photo-Bioelectric Signals
   Kruse suggests that Becker’s currents are generated by light-mediated processes, particularly through hydrated melanin sheets and CCO in mitochondria. He proposes:
	- Melanin’s Role: Hydrated melanin, derived from pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) cleavage, acts as a semiconductor, splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen under sunlight (especially UV and infrared [IR] light). This process generates pico/nano-scale currents akin to Becker’s, which guide cellular behavior during wound healing. Kruse argues that these currents are disrupted in modern environments due to artificial light (e.g., blue light from screens) and lack of natural sunlight exposure, particularly at sunrise.
	- CCO and DDW: Kruse links CCO, a mitochondrial enzyme sensitive to light (especially near-infrared [NIR]), to the production of DDW via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. DDW, with lower deuterium content, enhances mitochondrial efficiency and supports regeneration. Becker’s currents, in Kruse’s view, may arise from these light-driven mitochondrial processes, which are synchronized with circadian rhythms. Disruption of this synchronization (e.g., no AM sunrise exposure) impairs current generation, stalling regeneration.

2. Wound Healing and Atavistic States
   Kruse draws a parallel between wound healing and cancer, viewing both as atavistic processes where cells revert to a primitive, glycolytic (Warburg) metabolism:
	- Methemoglobin (MetHb) and Hypoxia: In wounds, hypoxia induces methemoglobin formation, where hemoglobin’s iron is oxidized to Fe³⁺, reducing oxygen-carrying capacity. This triggers cellular depolarization, a bioelectric state (low membrane potential, ~ -50 mV) that promotes dedifferentiation into stem-like cells, as Becker observed. Kruse suggests this is an evolutionary throwback to the oxygen-scarce Cambrian period, enabling regeneration.
	- Becker’s Currents in Regeneration: Becker’s application of pico/nano currents (or silver ions) enhances this process by maintaining a negative potential at the wound site, mimicking the regenerative bioelectric fields of salamanders. Kruse posits that these currents, when coupled with light-driven melanin and CCO activity, guide dedifferentiated cells to form organized tissues rather than disorganized masses.

3. Cancer as Failed Regeneration
   Kruse hypothesizes that cancer arises when Becker’s regenerative currents fail due to circadian disruption or insufficient light exposure:
	- Persistent Depolarization: Without the photo-bioelectric “reset” from melanin-derived currents, dedifferentiated cells remain in a depolarized, Warburg-shifted state. This is exacerbated by modern stressors like blue light or non-native EMFs, which disrupt circadian regulation and melanin function.
	- Oxygen Surge: Rapid revascularization, driven by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), floods the hypoxic wound with oxygen. In the absence of Becker’s currents, cells cannot transition from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, remaining in a proliferative, cancer-like state. Kruse argues this mimics cancer’s Warburg metabolism, where cells favor glycolysis despite oxygen availability, driven by mitochondrial dysfunction (e.g., defective CCO).
	- Oncogenic Risk: These atavistic cells, stuck in a stem-like limbo, may undergo genomic instability (e.g., p53 mutations) or oxidative stress from reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), transitioning into malignancy. Kruse sees this as a biophysical failure, not just a biochemical one, overlooked by conventional oncology.

4. Methylene Blue’s Double-Edged Role
   Kruse questions the safety of methylene blue in this context, given its role in reducing methemoglobin to hemoglobin:
	- MetHb as a Signal: Kruse posits that methemoglobin is a critical signal for dedifferentiation in wound healing, as it mimics the hypoxic, atavistic state Becker leveraged. Using MB to reduce MetHb could prematurely halt this signal, potentially disrupting regeneration if administered without proper light exposure (UV, IR, and sunrise).
	- Circadian Context: MB’s redox effects depend on mitochondrial function, which is light- and circadian-regulated. Without AM sunrise to activate CCO and the TCA cycle, MB may not restore aerobic metabolism, leaving cells in a Warburg state. This could exacerbate oncogenic risk, especially if oxygen influx occurs without bioelectric guidance.

5. Circadian Dysregulation and Melanin Failure
   Kruse emphasizes that modern lifestyles—lacking AM sunrise, UV, and IR light—disrupt the circadian regulation of melanin and CCO, impairing Becker’s currents:
	- Melanin Sheets: In Kruse’s model, melanin’s water-splitting ability generates proton gradients and pico/nano currents, akin to Becker’s, which are essential for repolarizing cells (~ -70 mV) during regeneration. Artificial light (e.g., 435–470 nm blue light) or EMF exposure may inhibit this, leaving cells depolarized and proliferative.
	- Circadian Genes: Disruption of nuclear circadian genes (e.g., Rev-erb A/B) by light stress or nnEMF could impair heme protein function (like CCO), reducing DDW production and mitochondrial efficiency. This stalls the bioelectric feedback loop Becker described, favoring cancer over regeneration.

Critically Examining Kruse’s Perspective
While Kruse’s ideas are compelling, they blend established science with speculative leaps, requiring critical scrutiny:

- Strengths:
    - Becker’s Foundation: Kruse accurately captures Becker’s core insight that pico/nano currents guide regeneration by altering bioelectric potentials and inducing dedifferentiation.

    - Warburg-Cancer Link: The parallel between wound healing’s atavistic state and cancer’s Warburg metabolism is supported by research showing cancer cells’ preference for glycolysis and depolarization.

    - Light and Melanin: Emerging studies on melanin’s semiconductor properties and light-driven water splitting align with Kruse’s claims about its role in bioelectric signaling, though direct links to Becker’s currents are unproven.
        
    - Circadian Influence: Circadian disruption is increasingly linked to cancer risk, supporting Kruse’s emphasis on light cycles affecting mitochondrial and bioelectric function.
    
- Weaknesses and Speculation:
    - Melanin and DDW: While melanin’s photoelectric properties are documented, its role in generating Becker’s pico/nano currents or producing DDW in vivo is speculative and lacks direct experimental evidence. The link between CCO, DDW, and regeneration is also hypothetical.
    - MetHb and Cancer: Kruse’s claim that MetHb is a critical regenerative signal disrupted by MB is plausible but untested. MB’s role in cancer is complex, with studies showing both pro- and anti-tumor effects depending on context (e.g., photodynamic therapy vs. redox modulation).
    - Circadian-Cancer Link: While circadian disruption is a known cancer risk factor, Kruse’s specific mechanism (disrupted melanin currents leading to oncogenesis) is not yet supported by peer-reviewed data.
    - Overemphasis on Light: Kruse’s focus on sunrise, UV, and IR light as essential for regeneration oversimplifies the multifactorial nature of wound healing and cancer, potentially ignoring genetic, environmental, and biochemical drivers.

Testable Predictions
Kruse proposes a mouse model to test his hypothesis, which could validate or refute his claims:

- Experiment: Induce hypoxic wounds in mice, disrupt circadian rhythms (e.g., constant light exposure), and monitor cell fate with or without applied pico/nano currents mimicking Becker’s.
- Metrics: Measure membrane potential (voltage-sensitive dyes), MetHb levels, lactate production (Warburg shift), and oncogenic markers (Ki67, p53).
- Expected Outcome: Kruse predicts higher tumor incidence in circadian-disrupted mice without bioelectric currents, vs. regeneration in those with restored currents and proper light exposure.

### Summary

From Dr. Jack Kruse’s perspective, Robert O. Becker’s pico/nano currents are bioelectric signals critical for wound healing, generated not only by tissue injury but also by light-driven processes involving hydrated melanin and CCO. These currents guide dedifferentiation and regeneration by maintaining proper cellular polarization and metabolic states. Kruse posits that modern disruptions—artificial light, circadian misalignment, or premature MB use—impair these currents, leaving cells in a depolarized, Warburg-shifted state. If revascularization occurs without bioelectric resolution, these atavistic cells may become oncogenic, framing cancer as “regeneration gone rogue.” While grounded in Becker’s established work, Kruse’s ideas incorporate speculative elements about melanin, DDW, and circadian regulation that require further research. His hypothesis challenges centralized medicine’s biochemical focus, urging a biophysical approach to understanding oncogenesis and healing.
