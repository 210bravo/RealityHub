Methemoglobin is a form of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen, where the iron atom in the heme group is in the Fe³⁺ (ferric) state instead of the normal Fe²⁺ (ferrous) state. This altered state prevents methemoglobin from effectively binding and transporting oxygen, potentially leading to a condition called methemoglobinemia. 

## Key points about methemoglobin:

- **Normal vs. Methemoglobin:**
    In healthy individuals, a small percentage of hemoglobin naturally converts to methemoglobin, but it's usually quickly converted back to normal hemoglobin by the body. 

- **Oxygen Transport Impairment:**
    Methemoglobin cannot carry oxygen, which can lead to oxygen deficiency in the body's tissues. 

- **Causes:**
    Methemoglobinemia can be congenital (inherited) or acquired, with the latter often caused by exposure to certain medications, chemicals, or toxins. 

- **Symptoms:**
    Symptoms can include cyanosis (a bluish tint to the skin), headache, shortness of breath, and in severe cases, loss of consciousness. 

- **Treatment:**
    Treatment often involves methylene blue administration, blood transfusions, or other supportive measures, depending on the severity of the condition. 

- **Infants at Risk:**
    Infants, especially those under six months, are more susceptible to methemoglobinemia due to their developing enzyme systems and higher levels of fetal hemoglobin. 

- **Examples of Causes:**
    Some common medications associated with methemoglobinemia include dapsone, benzocaine, and some antimalarial drugs.
