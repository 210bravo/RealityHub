# About

This is a work in progress. This is my attempt to make sense of the world. This information is for my research alone. My ideas are continually changing as I learn more about our history and our current events. Do not take anything here as complete or correct. 

The majority of this content has been produced with Grok 3.

## Navigation

The file explorer on the left should give you access to all of the documents I have uploaded, but most information should be able to be found by following stories and their wikilinks.

> [!map]+ # Maps of Content
> This note collects all notes where the `in` property says `Maps`. 
> 
> ```dataview
> TABLE WITHOUT ID
> 	file.link as Map
> WHERE
> 	contains(in,this.file.link) and
> 	!contains(file.name, "Template")
> SORT file.name asc
> LIMIT 222
